l6omry,2021-01-28,2021-01-28 00:06:14,"An Open Letter to Melvin Capital, CNBC, Boomers, and WSB"," **Mods do not delete, this is important to me, please read**

&#x200B;

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

We just have to hold until they fold. Today's actions by several brokers just show how desperate the hedge funds are getting.

Hold with your immovable diamond hands for all that you hold dear and we will be breaking Wall Street **TOGETHER** while making gargantuan tendies in the end!

**WE LIKE THE STOCK.**

Comment with brokers that aren't corruptible and that we can move to fast!

**Fidelity** (10k instant deposit, accounts can be opened quickly)  
**Others:** Vanguard, Revolut, TastyWorks, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Webull, Degiro, Wells Fargo, M1, Public, etc.

*Edit*: It seems like TD Ameritrade, Webull, M1 Finance, and Public have removed their restrictions. Brokers are folding to the political support we are receiving.

l6j4r9,2021-01-27,2021-01-27 19:36:02,Where do we go from here and who is going to step up to help us?,"We have grown to the kind of size we only dreamed of in the time it takes to get a bad nights sleep. We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators. We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn't allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven't given us special access despite asking for it.

We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don't get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and **I am not impressed with them destroying our community** instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.

To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won't mention their accounts, but lots of handles with ""wsb"" and ""wallstreetbets"" in them are pretending to speak for us. They're saying things that we don't agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There's also too much political bullshit in a community that was never *ever* political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.

~~That is why I'm throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general. We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren't doing anything wrong here if they don't respond. We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse. We can't be expected to meet any expectations when we aren't given the tools we need.~~

~~That's not to say I approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them, but it's clear to me we can't do nothing and we need a megaphone.~~

~~We'll do our best not to pretend to speak for you, but to try to speak with the volume our name now seems to command to get shit done for us.~~

EDIT: As of recent developments the aforementioned twitter handle is obviously not legit anymore. Phew.",120956,26970,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6j4r9/where_do_we_go_from_here_and_who_is_going_to_step/,all,Mods,0.92

lajk83,2021-02-01,2021-02-01 20:05:33,Today wasn’t a bloodbath for $GME or $AMC. WE watched LITERAL insanity as Hedgies sat and traded their trash BACK and forth to each other in order to cause YOU to panic. HOLD. BUY.,"DD I saw posted elsewhere: hedge funds are trying their hardest to short ladder $AMC and $GME. Just hold your stock, buy more if you can afford to! 

Check out real time trade stats by googling: ""Nasdaq AMC real time trades"" and you'll see all the trade orders are 100 share volumes every millisecond. 

These are desperate hedge funds trading their stocks back and forth for a lower and lower price, driving the price down. The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode!

The shirts tried their damndest to drive down the share prices of both $GME and $AMC today. Specifically look at $AMC. With all that volume traded you’d expect a shitload more movement. What they got was **resistance** You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can’t trade. On BOTH stocks. 

The way forward is to tell them to go fuck themselves and BUY that shit up tomorrow. Let them keep punting the football back and forth to one another all day. If they can double down and play the long game SO can we. 

This is not financial advice. I’m just a retard who REALLY likes these stocks.

lalucf,2021-02-01,2021-02-01 22:03:05,I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions,"TLDR; **Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**

So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner

EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:

* The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts

* I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.

* My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. 

* Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. 

* Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. 

* I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.


If I take an L to 0, I take an L to 0. I don't invest what I can't lose. But you can bet your ass I'll be holding till this blows open.

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926–2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt’s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers’ Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged—March 27—silver fell to $10.80, the metal’s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, “A billion dollars isn’t what it used to be,” the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978–91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",86022,2013,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1o04/there_is_no_silver_short_squeeze_happening_none/,all,Discussion,0.9

laikd0,2021-02-01,2021-02-01 19:17:47,I feel like clarification is needed about Today,"There’s a lot of new people on here that don’t really understand the play going on right now on both sides and I felt like we need to clear up some misconceptions so you can make your own decisions. 

**Why no spike today?**:

First of all, we can’t know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts. 
All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON’T COVER. 
They use several tactics to delay it, but they can’t circumvent it.
They’re bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.

It might take just a few days, or weeks...
But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price.
That’s why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it’s not.

We also know they’re down BAD. Why?
Because they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.

So let’s see what tactics they are using:

**Short ladder attacks**:

What is a short ladder attack? 
The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it ""looks"" like the stock is plummeting. It’s only effective if we would sell. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ay2s/short_ladder_attack_explained/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Just look at the volume. People are not selling:
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont_panic_and_just_look_at_the_fucking_volume/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**Infiltrating WSB and other social media**:

Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth. Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There’s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahqex/notice_the_two_obvious_melvin_employees_time_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**Manipulating the Media**: 

Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8n7o/fake_news/
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6e16/cnn_back_off_this_is_a_lie_literally_a_5_second/

Now let’s get some clarification on **SILVER:**

There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don’t seem to realize 3 things:

1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO) 
2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make. 
3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media. 

SLV inverting GME: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.

**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that’s just my retard opinion. 

**SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.

Silver squeeze not happening links:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Well. Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly: 

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Long version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**At these levels it’s NOT about the price, it’s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That’s why they want you to sell so bad.**

🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎

Last but not least I’m holding because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I’m holding because I hope to see a better future and I’m holding for all you out there. 
To the Moon or zero.

We made GME go from 4 to 400 and it took combined trading platforms to silence and cheat to bring it to 90.,"Did everyone forget what happened in Thursday? That was a calculated effort to bring down our position. FUCK OFF BILLIONAIRS, well still take you fucking money; who do you think will fund our food stamps?

We didn’t “lose” because we made a bad call, we “lost” because we made the RIGHT call and this disturbed  some folks at the top. 

I was reading 2 articles in Wall Street journal and it made my blood boil- first article was saying “random penny stock went up 30% with no news or announcement”- the people that are paid to predict and report and are the expert at stock market are saying this shit. The second article right after made me want to fuck the writers wife: “GME and AMC, Reddit favorite stocks, plunged after apparent loss in interest from retail investors” LOSS IN  INTEREST? MOTHERFUCKER WE CAN ONLY BUY 5 FUCKING SHARES EACH. 

WE LIKE THE STOCK. THOSE FUCKS JUST DON’T LET US BUY IT. How is GameStop and AMC and BB not already suing robinhood? Is any stock expert really gonna act like had they not restricted in Thursday, it would have went down that much? 

What the fuck is this gaslighting? That last week didn’t happen? Why are every news channel acting like they called GME or BB or AMC falling like it happened organically and not deliberately by everyone involved? 

Is GME worth 400$? FUCK NO. But since when was the stock market about actual worth? Stocks have become fiat currency in themself, doesn’t matter than company quarterly earnings, or its news, if people buy it, it goes up. When you restrict that- it goes down. 

We were up against billions of fund, trading platforms that we do not own or have a say in, our weapons, controlled by the enemy. Those fucks in TV acting like they actually called GME falling like this or acting like this is perfectly normal are trying to gaslight us about what happened in Thursday.

Usually just for a laugh as I am a stodgy buy and hold guy and don't speculate often. When I saw the $GME shit happening a week ago I thought it was pure stupidity and was not planning on investing. In fact, I bought some $GME puts (which I've since sold since somehow they've gone up based on volatility) betting against the crowd here.

However, what has started as a decentralized short squeeze has morphed into a class movement. I'm a big populist and think we need big changes in this country, especially a transfer of wealth and power from the elites to the people. When this morphed into a class movement I became obsessed. However, I still wasn't going to buy in because I shy away from speculating on ultra risky stuff like this. But when Robinhood and all the other major brokerages colluded to cause a massive sell off, that's when it became a matter of principle. I've watched all day as the stock has remained relatively stable on very little volume. People are holding despite wall street twisting your arm and trying to make you tap out by only allowing you to sell. It's a beautiful thing to see.

l82y7u,2021-01-29,2021-01-29 15:17:25,How to Buy GME Above Broker Limits,"How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that ~~will work.~~

**Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&utm_medium=your_mom&utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **

1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).
2) Scroll all the way down the call list.
3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~

_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",75142,3862,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82y7u/how_to_buy_gme_above_broker_limits/,all,News,0.94

l7sx9e,2021-01-29,2021-01-29 08:47:56,"It’s time for a government bailout of GME shareholders at $10,000 per share. This would be roughly equivalent to the $700 billion bank bailout in 08 that was necessary to prevent ‘systemic risk’.","The short positions put on by the hedge funds are posing a systemic risk to the market.  Bail out both sides by liquidating the hedge funds, but not the brokers or clearinghouses, but also put a buy order in for $10k per share to allow GME shareholders to exit.  Isn’t $700 billion better than a financial meltdown?  Just like last time you can ‘put rules in place to make sure this won’t happen again’

In 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn’t bail them out, so the government did it.

We posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday.  By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.

Are we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008?  Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?

Edit because it got attention:  if this ever was a reality it would in the form of a loan to clearinghouses and brokers to cover any losses up to $10k per share.  They would have to pay it back over time.  The government would get the money back and reimburse taxpayers, while at the same time collecting taxes from the gains of the retail investors. Long term the clearinghouses and brokers recover, the market continues to function,  and then they never let hedge funds put on a risky play like that ever again. The hedge funds involved are deservedly bankrupt, and the retail traders get the reward they deserve by playing the free market game by the rules.",74743,2557,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7sx9e/its_time_for_a_government_bailout_of_gme/,all,Discussion,0.92

There are quite a few wsb-logo Twitter accounts pushing this. This is BS & the straight up the ANTITHESIS of who we are. 

By buying silver/going long on silver, you would be directly putting money into the pockets of the EXACT HEDGE FUNDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF $GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎 🙌  The hedge funds are LONG silver NOT short silver.

The media, Wall Street, normies, and every other non-WSB autist are trying to push you to buy silver. This would be a tragic, irreversible decision that not only will most likely not make you any money because the squeeze is fake, it will put you on the sidelines from this righteous and glorious war we are in. 

If you are looking for alternative investments to GME, I’d recommend simply getting in on the $BANG GANG- Blackberry, AMC, Nokia, and GME. 

For the feds and the media and all the dumb people reading this, I am the last thing from a financial advisor and am a complete, 100%, full retard autist. 

BANG GANG CHEEEEEEEHOOOOOOOOO

Edit: I am not talking down on silver as an investment, I am not saying it's not a good hedge, I'm not saying anything bad about silver in any form. I'm simply pointing out that right now, this ""squeeze"" that all these people are referring to is definitely not a ""squeeze"" at all and is an artificial hedge-fund driven attempt to reduce the GME momentum and we should all be cognizant of the media manipulation and happening everywhere including right here. For all you that want to buy silver, great, buying the bullion directly in my humble autistic opinion is better than shares in a fund that supposedly buys it but don't trust some autist on the internet. BANG GANG

Edit #2: Fellow autists, we have ascended to the #2 post on all of reddit. Our $GME gains this week and beyond will carry us to the gates of Valhalla.

It’s only a matter of time before we get back to that and even higher. I know a good stock when I see one. Prior plays I had big wins on include early investments with archer, joby, qubt, rigetti, rocket labs, and nbis. 

Quick background on redwire. They provide avionics and sensors for spacecraft and other camera systems, software development, and assist in manufacturing other equipment used in space missions and defense operations. 

Hedge funds increased ownership by 1.6m this quarter alone, such as Driehaus Capital and Royce & Associates. 

About 65% is owned by insiders, 15% is owned by institutions, and 20% is owned by retail traders. 

We saw what happened with Rocket Labs, ASTS, and many others… I believe this one will be back to the $20-$30 range very soon, and who knows how much higher. 

Fair market value is $28 (per Simply Wall Street), which implies about a 60% upside from current levels. 

Risks: like many companies in the early stages, there is concern of cash burn and dilution. That being said, for those who may be looking for a 1-3 year hold — this one is a strong buy and hold for me at the current price with a bigger upside than downside in my opinion.

Analysts noted that ChatGPT makes up a tiny fraction of Reddit traffic, and Piper Sandler’s Thomas Champion said the company’s relationship with Google—its main traffic funnel—remains intact ; Citizen JMP’s Andrew Boone added that concerns over search‑engine optimization are “noise” and highlighted momentum in Reddit’s core advertising business .  Trefis attributed the broader decline to concerns about slowing user growth and traffic headwinds tied to changes in Google’s search algorithms and AI‑generated answers , pointing out that Reddit’s valuation is rich with a price‑to‑sales multiple around 12x .  Nevertheless, the company’s fundamentals remain strong: Q2 2025 revenue rose over 20 % year‑over‑year and advertising revenue surged 84 % to $465 million , while data‑licensing deals such as a $60 million‑per‑year agreement with Google and may be a similar pact with OpenAI provide a growing revenue stream .  
Piper Sandler reiterated an overweight rating with a $290 target   and RBC Capital described the AI‑related worries as a “healthy reset” .

1nx5a3a,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 13:19:21,The $NEXT Big Play,"Howdy brothers,

After my $CRWV post materialized into a big multibagger this week, hundreds of people have been reaching out asking me for the next big play. Well, it's a liquid natural gas company called NextDecade.

  
$NEXT got inexplicably beat down recently to $7 from the $10-12 range after announcing POSITIVE news on September 10th that it received $6.7 billion to develop its Rio Grande LNG facility. On September 12th Morgan Stanley downgraded their price target on $NEXT which further pushed it down to $6. However, this downgrade was from $15 to $10, still way above the current price.

  
There's been colossal insider buying on $NEXT the last few weeks as well. The CEO recently bought 281,500 shares. He now owns $37 million in stock which is a massive green flag. Aerospace Co. acquired 449,510 shares just last Wednesday. 

  
The 50 day moving average of $NEXT is $9.51, and the 200 day moving average is $8.69. The current ratio is .70 and the debt to equity ratio is 2.77. Financials look solid and indicate an oversold position.

For all these reasons, I believe that $NEXT will be making a big movement upwards in the next two weeks. Calls are absolutely dirt cheap, I bought $7 calls for just $.30, two weeks out. My price target for this trade is $8 plus; this stock is disgustingly undervalued currently.

  
Position: 5000x $7 call expiring Oct. 17th.

On Tuesday, the stock suddenly dipped about a dollar, and from what it looked like, someone may have accidentally hit **sell instead of buy**. It wasn’t a huge move compared to some of the volatility we’ve seen in other names, but it stood out because the drop lined up with what looked like an abnormally large sell execution at the wrong time.

Fast forward to Thursday, and things got even more interesting. At **16:00:02**, right after the close, there was a massive **buy attempt of 1,409,696 shares at $79.63 on the NYSE**. The order shows up in the trade log, but didn’t actually go through in full, which raises some questions. Was this the same trader trying to correct their earlier mistake? A fund trying to scoop up a large block at the close? Or just an algorithm glitching out?

Here’s the snapshot from the tape that shows the activity: .What makes this noteworthy is the sheer size—1.4 million shares is not small potatoes, and whether or not it was intentional, it definitely suggests someone (or something) was very interested in loading up. For retail traders, this kind of anomaly is always interesting to dissect, even if it doesn’t necessarily mean anything for long-term price action.

The Cupertino company has moved staff from working on its new, lighter and cheaper Vision Pro to focus on its smart glasses, which would be similar to those offered by Meta Platforms, the report said, citing people close to the issue. Apple engineers are working on at least two types of the smart glasses. One is being crafted to be paired with an iPhone and will lack its own display. This could be revealed as soon as 2026. The other version will contain a display similar to the recently released Meta Ray-Ban Display.

Apple's smart glasses are expected to utilize voice interaction and AI capabilities, the report said. It would also rely on an upgraded Siri, which is projected for a March release at the earliest. They would also feature a much lower price tag than the Vision Pro, which started at $3,499.

Meta released its Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses on Tuesday, Sept. 30. They start at $799 and feature the Meta Neural Band. The AI-powered glasses allow users to ""interact with digital content while staying fully present in the physical world.""",75,96,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nvs275/apple_tables_vision_pro_sequel_to_pursue_smart/,new,Discussion,0.8

1nvpvso,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 20:53:54,$SNAP – The Only Specs That Matter 🚀,"Alright, listen up smoothbrains. While you apes are busy lighting your grandma’s retirement funds on fire buying quantum vaporware stocks with zero revenue and YOLO’ing into Opendoor like it’s the next Amazon instead of a failing real estate pawn shop, I’m looking at a stock that could 10x if this plays out. Yes, the ghost app you use to send nudes to your ex is actually a once-in-a-decade moon ticket.

[“JPow told my wife this was safe”](https://preview.redd.it/a84d6o9qglsf1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=374dc3ecc175dde106a5375911dff2da3083c33b)

Now let me explain why your mom’s boyfriend is bullish:

1. **ATH Collapse** – SNAP’s all-time high was \~$80 before Tim Apple slapped them across the face with iOS privacy changes. Ads went limp, Wall Street bailed, and SNAP cratered harder than your mom’s Tinder date. But that’s the reason the stock is sitting at 5-year lows today: **the decline was external, not because the company is fundamentally trash**.
2. **Spectacles = The Real AR Play** – SNAP has been grinding on AR spectacles for a decade. While Zuckbot embarrassed himself with his laugh-track VR demo, SNAP dropped a prototype that actually looks **usable**. Their consumer “Specs” are dropping in 2026, lighter and cheaper than the dev versions. They even built **Snap OS**, a full-blown platform optimized for AR, but you wouldn’t know that because you were too busy watching anime lolis instead of reading investor decks and paying attention to product demos.
3. **8 Billion Daily AR Lenses vs Google’s 14 Billion Searches** – On mobile alone, SNAP’s AR lenses are used **8 billion times a day**. Let me say that again: **8 BILLION WITH a ""B""**. Google search does \~14 billion daily. That means people are snapping AR dogs and anime filters like crazy at HALF THE SCALE OF GOOGLE SEARCH. When Specs launch, SNAP controls **both the hardware and the software**. That means unrestricted ad targeting, a user experience way better than the janky mobile AR crap, and here’s the kicker: they demoed **collaborative AR** between Specs users and mobile users. Imagine shoving ads in both realities at once. That’s a money printer even Papa Powell would respect.

I’m early into this play. Specs aren’t out until 2026, but the market is asleep at the wheel. SNAP’s been buying back stock in 2025, cutting costs with layoffs (10% in 2025), and getting their comp structure under control. They’re quietly setting the stage for the next wave while you guys YOLO weekly SPY puts like brain-damaged chimps.

Now, I’ll keep it real with you:

* Competition exists. But except for Meta, **Google and Apple don’t have social platforms** to tie AR into. Meta is bleeding billions on legless VR Sims. Apple’s Vision Pro flop shows that having the social layer is critical.
* Stock comp was a headwind, but layoffs and buybacks are stabilizing things.
* User growth is slowing but that’s true for all social media platforms. SNAP has 900 million monthly active users. The key is jumping onto the next big thing that feeds into revenue.
* CEO Evan Spiegel has majority voting rights. Which means if he wakes up one day and decides to turn the ghost into a furry NFT, we’re screwed. Expect some WSB level decisions at times.

**Bottom line:** SNAP is sitting near its 5-year low, the market has priced in zero upside, and the next catalyst (Specs) is massive. From here, this can only go up. Not financial advice. I am jacked to the tits.  
  
**Position:** 81600 shares bought over the last 2 weeks. ",313,217,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nvpvso/snap_the_only_specs_that_matter/,new,DD,0.86

1nvla89,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 17:34:32,Exited too early on a 40x trade…,"Been pretty shaken up about this for hours now…

Thought I made a great trade when I bought and sold this Eli Lilly call option yesterday for over +500% profit (turned $179 into $1,086 within the same day) 

I had to sell this contract and cash out because I needed the money to cover the amount I was short on rent (which was due today), pay some bills, and afford groceries & other necessities - Also didn’t think that exiting the position when it hit 6x was that conservative. 

Before anyone comes at me for “gambling to make a living/afford food & rent” - I actually work full-time in finance, in office 5 days a week. But anyone familiar with UK salaries will understand that a job is simply not enough, especially if you’re relatively young/entry-mid level, which I am (The average rent in London is higher than the average monthly take-home pay in this city…so yeah). 

I had bought this call when the stock price was $730 yesterday, and sold when it hit $760 (which was my strike price anyway). 

But if I had known that it was going to increase by 100 POINTS in 2 days (past $830), I would have obviously kept it. 

The figure at the top of this contract isn’t 100% accurate (the highest price I saw on the option chain was around $7,335), but even just based on this amount, I missed out on an extra $6,000 of profit. It would have alleviated so much of my financial stress; and having turned $179 into $7,075 with one  ~40x trade would have been an amazing feeling.

Why I am playing PACS: it is severely undervalued compared to its closest competitor (Ensign)

Yes, ENSG has a larger portfolio  
Yes, ENSG has better margins

But to justify a \~5x greater valuation by market cap? See chart below:

|Metric|PACS Group|The Ensign Group|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Market Cap**|$2.13 billion|$9.97 billion|
|**SNF Beds**|32,208|\~35,427|
|**Revenue (Q2 2025)**|$981.8 million|$1.04 billion|
|**Revenue Growth YoY**|26.8%|16.6%|
|**Adj. EBITDA Margin**|\~10% (estimated)|11.2%|
|**P/E Ratio (Approx.)**|10-15x|\~30x|



PACS likely to report earnings in November... holding for Valhalla

Targeting $30 by 2026. We will see if the medicare fraud allegations and CFO shenanigans is worth $5 billion in market cap.

\---

Lots of people been asking me for my DD on gap - so here's a weeks worth of insights & market research into $GAP. I think there's potential, but we won't know the result until ER's.

Traditional metrics at a glance before diving in.

**Price & Value:** It's currently trading at a P/E of \~9.5 which tends to signal ""undervalued"" or ""something is wrong"". Which one is it here? I compared to competitors -- LULU has a P/E of 12 & AEO: P/E of 16.5. We need to rule out ""something is wrong"" -- which I discuss below (is GAP dead?). It's trading at a significant discount... why?

**Stability**: GAP has a solid dividend (\~3% at the time of posting) & has been around since the 1960s. It is a very well known and recognized international brand that's not going anywhere.

**Sentiment**: Everyone I chatted with was bullish on GAP. I didn't see many real big bear arguments other than ""it's a dead brand"" and ""insiders sold 500k shares"". I commented on those below & would like to hear more views on why this is a bad investment or my thesis is wrong / will not play out.

**Team:** You can do your own research into the executive team here, I had a glance over a few people. They have a solid team who can execute & who I believe are genuinely interested in turning the company around. Current CEO ran Mattel for a long time & was heavily involved in growing barbie, hot wheels & fisher-price. He's been CEO of GAP for \~2 years and doing well via his playbook. The rest of their executive team also has an impressive history. Price hasn't really moved in the last 2 years despite good execution (imo).  [https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/about/leadership/executive-leadership-team](https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/about/leadership/executive-leadership-team)

**Current Average Analyst PT:** \~24.4

**Catalyst**: They just launched their most successful ad campaign ever -- I validated it was real myself. I haven't seen too many in the investing world talking about it. See the reference source below (another WSB's DD) for tik tok impressions - it's over 100 million views on just one video. Their youtube ad has over 3x the number of impressions as the AEO ad did and the campaign is considered by many to be ""more successful"". They got over half a billion views in aggregate. **The ad campaign started on AUG 19th, ONLY 9 DAYS BEFORE THE LAST ER's & resulted in an 8.5% increase in foot traffic during the first week.** The rest we don't know (we can only speculate). We won't know the true results until next ER's. I looked at the google trends for bullish terms related to this campaign / ad -- see below. We won't know if this was a one off event or the start of a trend until ER's.

**Similar Events:** AEO launched a highly successful ad campaign (Sydney Sweeney has good jeans). I looked at their google trends & diffed them. The trends on this one actually did jump on this ad campaign, similar to how AEO did. And the jumps seemed more pronounced on GAP.

\---

**Trends (correlated to online sales):** \~40% of gaps sales come from online, some search terms spiked by 200-400% interest. GAP order spiked by \~450%, GAP buy by \~500% & some other related terms I looked up had similar spikes. We're operating on incomplete information here -- I can't quantify how the trends map to sales (they do tend to be correlated tho). Search interest != sales

[Various terms to buy gap online spiked by 200-400&#37; - shown 5 year average](https://preview.redd.it/j3kfhe7jukrf1.png?width=2476&format=png&auto=webp&s=083a51a039a23b3b63ca54b0a43209e12b1e6b33)

\---

**Trends (correlated to in store sales):** \~60% of sales comes from in store (citation needed -- someone clarify numbers please). This jump in august (ie: before school season) doesn't typically occur. There is a periodic trend that can been seen spiking in November (what happens in nov???). I noticed this across all search terms. Search interest for ""Gap location"" spiked by a staggering 800% and ""Gap store"" spiked \~300%. The Aug / sept spike doesn't usually occur - it's a unique event (which I suspect is related to the ad campaign).

\---

Relative spike / comparable one for AEO (It also lasted a similar amount of time). For comparison purposes. For reference -- AEO is up from $11 to $17 (55% since they started their ad campaign). GAP is up... \~2% (\~$21 -> 21.7)

\---

**ER's Call:** I listened to the entire ER's call. You can find it on youtube here. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQpVaT0MNpA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQpVaT0MNpA) . Transcript can be found here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GAP/earnings/GAP-Q2-2026-earnings\_call-351764.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GAP/earnings/GAP-Q2-2026-earnings_call-351764.html)

**Insights**: TLDW: Focusing on growth, brand. Mentioned ad a few times -- but didn't push it or mention potential impacts much. CEO dropped some hints, but I don't think they were picked up on by many

**\~28:40** (Katrina O'Connell, CFO): ""Last quarter, we previewed an estimated net tariff impact of fiscal twenty twenty five of approximately 100,000,000 to 150,000,000 from the April trade policy. I am proud that the teams have since mitigated the majority of that impact. Reflected in our outlook today is the estimated incremental impact related to the latest trade policies effective August 7. Starting with full year 2025 net sales, **we continue to expect net sales to be up 1% to 2% year over year**. Our outlook assumes ongoing strength at Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic, and a longer recovery at Athleta.""

**\~42:40** (Richard Dickson, CEO): ""This campaign, which launched last week starring Katseye, has driven record breaking response for the brand. Early reads. This is striking range of probably being one of the most iconic brand campaigns certainly that we've done, but that is out there. People aren't just watching, but they're actively joining and **suggesting that this is actually a cultural takeover**. These are great proof points and elements that, again, the playbook is working"".

**My read / take:** They are forecasting not a huge jump in net sales & didn't push the ad super hard as the results were unknown. They mentioned their ad got 20million views in the first 3 days. I don't think people paid too much attention to it on the call, via the Q&A at the end. Search for ""eye"" in the transcript - it was only mentioned twice as far as I can tell. GAP has had a beat on the last 8 ER's. You can validate this yourself. They seem to undersell themselves on guidance / projections each time (ie: I think CEO might sandbag guidance to get beats every time). Tariffs were mentioned \~30 times on the call - I think that's the concern most analysts had (risks) & was a major discussion point (dominating the ad campaign)

\---

**Bear Arguments:**

**Insider Selling (recent 500k):** For people worried about the recent 500k share insider sale. I looked into it. As per google: ""Following the transaction, Mr. Fisher directly owns **12,835,433 shares**, indirectly holds 2,829,502 shares by trust, 132,257 by spouse and 22,015,000 by limited partnerships"", ie: **he owns \~38million shares** still. He's been a director of GAP since 1990 & he sold \~1.5% of his stake. **He's 71**, probs just want a house on the water or something. **I give him a pass.**

**GAP IS DEAD:** I asked around a bit (including talking to girls in the bar, and had 3 friends go to the store and talk to employees / view foot traffic). I don't believe this is true. Several of the girls I chatted with were into GAP (aged \~24-28) and two had even heard of the katseye ad. I asked a few investors to chat with their kids / wives / etc, and several were into GAP right now (who previously were not). I don't have a large enough sample size to say much about this -- but talking around I don't think it's true. I even went as far as had a few friends physically go to the stores and chat with employees. I got some mixed reviews on how much busier gap is, but the general consensus was ""its been getting a little busier these last few years""

**Low Trade Volume:** Welcome to buying things market hasn't noticed yet (or just be completely wrong, both are possible). Nobody was talking about GAP on the investing forums I frequent / lurk. It has very little volume, IV is super low. It's cheap via all traditional metrics as compared to competitors. I suspect people will start to look at / evaluate GAP as we get closer to the ER's. I really have no idea tho -- low volume just signifies to me that not many people are looking at it (yet) - which gives me a little more confidence in my thesis. It means I'm either early or just wrong. The catalyst outlined \*already occurred\* and I'm just trying to price in the effects of it. The general consensus I got from other investors (who hadn't looked at anything) was ""gap is dead I thought?""

**Tariffs:** As per above, tariffs were mentioned \~30 times during the last ER's. It was a major talking point, and although it is a risk, imo it's been priced in already. Literally everyone already knows about them & all the analysts considered them when coming up with their existing estimates. ie, imo, priced in.

**I need more bear arguments, please comment bear arguments or correct / highlight misinformation in my thesis. Why won't this thesis play out? I'm aware that trends != sales, I'm operating on incomplete information. If we all knew the results of this it'd be perfectly priced in already**

\---

**Some sources (WSB DD):** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping_up/)

TLDR of the DD: Super successful ad campaign (similar to how AEO used sydney sweeney) - but GAPs is looking more successful. Their Youtube ads got over 3x the number of views in a shorter period of time compared to the sweeney ads & GAPs ads have also been insanely successful on tik tok - generating hundreds of millions of impressions. It went viral with the younger generation. Inventory related to the campaign was sold out across the board everywhere the original DD guy looked.

**Comparison of AEO vs GAP campaign (ie: fighting for cultural relevance).** [https://www.brandvm.com/post/gap-vs-american-eagle-ads-2025](https://www.brandvm.com/post/gap-vs-american-eagle-ads-2025)

TLDR: Looks like GAPs campaign had larger impact & even resulted in increased foot traffic during the first week.

**Another high level source / thread:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american\_eagles\_earnings\_blowout\_is\_bullish\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american_eagles_earnings_blowout_is_bullish_for/)

TLDR of the DD: Similar catalyst for GAP as AEO.

\---

**Realistic price targets:** Putting a P/E target of \~12 (imo it is growing after what I looked into) puts the price target up to \~27.5-28.0. They've beat their last 8 er's and market isn't rewarding them for it yet. Their executive team has been delivering ever since Richard Dickson took over as CEO. I also suspect sales may come in hotter than expected resulting in a beat, suggesting even higher targets. I don't see much more downside here, I've been averaging into more calls

\---

**Poker room:** I posted my positions to WSB's. I was doing DD / market research in the comments with some other investors. Mods silently removed it after a week without telling me. A lot of people picked up on this & asked me why it was removed. Mods didn't give me a reason -- I'll let you guys decide why they would do that

\---

If you can't stomach the volatility in my positions - then my trading style is not suited for you. I'm either early or wrong, we will know at the next ER's.

1nutrag,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 20:19:19,$SNAP - Everyone loves to hate it,"$SNAP Position: 200,000 shares at $8.15

Sentiment is just awful for after missing numbers quarter after quarter. 

What I like: -Massive DAU and MAU, still growing users, albeit not in North America.

-Revenue is growing YoY, albeit at a low rate.

-Subscription revenue is at $700mm annualized now. They’re aggressively trying to grow it, most recently by requiring a subscription for Memories storage of over 5GB.

-Spiegel is out in public making a lot of speeches and seems to be fired up in turning the ship around. His recent letter to employees showed he has some renewed vigor and talked about “start-up like returns”.

-Balance sheet is ok, leverage ratios are fine. They have time to turn this ship around, there are no dangers of breaching any debt covenants. 

-Valuation is cheap and the stock has been left for dead. Market has no faith in management and it feels like the company only exists to enrich insiders. I like this because it’s priced for failure, yet a hint of a turnaround can easily make this a multi-bagger.

What I don’t like:  -Company can’t seem to turn a GAAP profit. Too many employees, too much investment into non-core such as Spectacles; a lot of fat needs to be cut. 

-Excessive stock-based comp. They are sensitive to it and recently started buying back stock. Dilution rate is decreasing.

-Gross margins at 51% are low for this type of business.

-User growth is mainly in India, where ARPU is around 7x lower than in the U.S.

What needs to happen for the stock to re-rate:

They need to start growing revenue double digits and start showing positive free cash flow every quarter going forward. 

One way to do that is by growing the subscription revenue aggressively as that gets a high multiple and is fairly steady high margin revenue. Keep coming out with must-have features that are only accessible to subscribers.

Another way is to cut a lot of employees. Too many mouths to feed, too much comp, and not enough to show for it. Layoffs are sad, but necessary, headcount keeps growing double digits while revenue doesn’t. 

Evan is a young billionaire married to a supermodel and living in California. He’s achieved everything in life, but you can see that he’s really pissed at Zuckerberg for ripping off Snap features (check out his LinkedIn profile for example).

(Working Draft)

Originated: 02/01/25 10:27 am CST

Last edit: 02/18/25 3:14 pm CST

 

Authors note: I've been holding on to this for a couple months; after getting exactly 0 job interview (and being correct on the first hypothesis), I wanted to share with y'all in hopes that you may profit.

 

Primary Hypothesis (moderate-strong confidence):

The commercial real estate market is potentially entering a more turbulent period.

Despite the strong economic recovery since 2020, the commercial real estate space has continued to struggle, particularly office space.  
  


As monetary conditions remain relatively tight, it is possible that mortgages written on properties in a low-interest rate environment may struggle to be refinanced; this may be exacerbated by workflow trends, increased vacancies, and stagnating fundamentals  
  
Secondary Hypothesis (moderate-weak confidence):  
  
The insurance industry largely prefers to reinvest premiums in fixed-income and interest bearing assets.  
As we have transitioned from a low-rate environment to a high one, I anticipate that any risks associated with low-yield instruments held on balance sheets have been properly hedged by now.[\[1\]](#_ftn1)

However, with an increased cost of replacement materials due to elevated inflation/wages and increasing prevalence of natural disasters, I believe that underlying market fundamentals may have shifted; the underwriting process is becoming more challenging. In the pursuit of greater returns (and based on personal/quantitative analysis), I believe this industry may be seeking out returns in a manner that is sub-optimal.

 

Tertiary Hypothesis (weak confidence):

As banks have shied away from lending, private credit, private equity and non-banks have stepped in to fill the gap in lending. This tends to be less regulated, and may be implicated in the above referenced.  
  
\*I will probably ignore the last hypothesis for now.  
  
  


**Initial Data:**

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/zya7ce5shcsf1.png?width=539&format=png&auto=webp&s=520736582f5944d516723cdf9c4fe3fe1b2106b2)

Fred Data:  


Figure 1 shows the total amount of commercial real estate (CRE) loans held by all commercial banks through Q4 2024.[\[2\]](#_ftn2)  Figure 2 shows the annual change of CRE loans through Q4 2024.[\[3\]](#_ftn3)

Comparing the two, the percentage annual change became positive in Q4 of 2012, experienced (at least two) local peaks in Q1 2015 and Q3 2022, and has been below single digits in the last two quarters (2024 Q3: 0.3%, Q4: 0.6%).

A critical component of loan origination is the Federal Funds Rate.

 Below, a table that includes the total value of these underlying loans, 3 months pre/post the calendar month in which the Federal Reserve changed the direction of interest rates:

 

 

  
  


 

||
||
|Date|Amount ($B) or rate shift|Change ($B)|% Change|
| 9/1/2015|1734.044| | |
|12/17/2015|rate increase|97.746|5.636881|
|3/1/2016|1831.790| | |
|5/1/2019|2230.241| | |
|8/1/2019|rate decrease|63.294|2.837989|
|11/1/2019|2293.535| | |
|12/1/2019|2320.046| | |
|3/3/2020|rate decrease|64.232|2.768566|
|6/1/2020|2384.278| | |
|12/1/2021|2531.718| | |
|3/17/2022|rate increase|129.685|5.122411|
|6/1/2022|2661.403| | |
|6/1/2024|2998.333| | |
|9/18/2024|rate decrease|8.457|0.282057|
|12/1/2024|3006.790| | |

 

This would seem counter-intuitive: when interest rates rise, the magnitude of change over a +/- 3 month period is greater than the magnitude of change when interest rates fall.[\[4\]](#_ftn4)

There are at least two (or more) likely explanations for this:

1.      In an economic environment where rate increases are warranted, lending activity is elevated. When interest rate decreases are warranted, lending activity is depressed.

2.      When interest rate increases are expected, origination's are increased in anticipation. When interest rate decreases are expected, originations are delayed in anticipation.

I have also analyzed this 1 month pre/post (not included): a similar pattern exists and may be included in further versions.

Market depth:  
  
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis[\[5\]](#_ftn5), the Commercial Real Estate Market was valued at $22.5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Back then, banks and thrifts held the majority of the $5.9 trillion debt (50%), followed by Government-sponsored enterprises(17%), insurance companies and securitized debt (approximately 12% each).  


According to Statista, the total in 2025 is expected to be $25.79 trillion.[\[6\]](#_ftn6)  
  
According to Janus Henderson, the Commercial Mortgage Backed Security market is worth approximately $1.7 trillion as of Q4 2024.

https://preview.redd.it/56lykeo0icsf1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c4bf1c5fe061270bacbd55522fb4e338c48984a

**Background (CRE/Office emphasis):**

The data suggests that the United States remains in a period of economic expansion. Through Dec. 2024, the benchmark indices have gained more than 50% in two years.

However, recent GDP growth has slowed in the most recent quarter (2.3% Q4 2024 vs. 3.1% Q3 2024).[\[7\]](#_ftn7)  
  
The author of this document is restraining this document to a specific segment of the macroeconomic picture: commercial real estate.

For example, a recent article from Commercial Real Estate news states that there was 5.8 million sqft of negative absorption in the most recent quarter, with 57 million sqft for FY 2024. National vacancy for office space sits at 20.9 percent, up from last years 19.4 percent.[\[8\]](#_ftn8)

  
49 out of 93 office markets recorded negative absorption in the latest quarter.[\[9](#_ftn9)

  
The entire space has approx. 5.46 billion sqft of space. Average asking rent was $38.20/sf, up from $37.67/sf a year earlier, representing 1.4% increase in rent overall.  
  
(Author’s note: I intend to add more to this)  
  
Data:  
  
**Graph #1: CMBS Issuance Data (**generated from csv file; Source :Trepps)  


 

https://preview.redd.it/1p0c4wk7icsf1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b84d0922fb35ab1430986dd5d9a4d11ec31ade



This is a time series of CMBS issuance data, in $T(Q2 2024-Q1 2010). In a vacuum, when analyzing risk assets, one would assume an exponential slope. I am not certain that applies here.

  
A notable inflection in the data occurs between the Q3 and Q4  2019 data points ($1,595.9 Billion to $1,634.4 B, a sequential change of \~$38 B). The following points a less steep increase, starting in 202

The slope of the graph starts to accelerate for the Q2 – 2021 data point (as the economy began re-opening), and began to flatten again in Q1 – 2022. The Federal Reserve beginning to hike interest rates in March of 2022.  
  
(simplified) context: origination tends to slow in rising/elevated interest rate environments, and the term of loans for commercial real estate properties generally have a duration of 5-10 years.  
  
The Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates in September of 2024, and they have fallen a full percentage point; however, inflation remains persistent, and the current signaling is no further cuts until June of 2025. Below, the head and tail of a CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) table.

The above two graphs represent delinquent loan count by type and a delinquency time series, respectively. without having a dataset to work on but briefly (Jan. 25):

‘Office’: 10.03% (only two time points have surpassed this: July 2012 and December 2024)

‘Retail’: 6.72%

‘Lodging’: 5.76%

‘Multifamily’: 1.55%

‘Industrial’: 0.44%

**Additional Individual Analysis:**

This is an extension of a series I wrote between December 2022 and March 2023. While lacking precision, I was correct in predicting the conditions that led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

I am taking a more measured approach now, but the following are personal observations that I have made as a resident of Dallas, Texas.  
  
I started noticing many “For Lease/For Sale” signs, in addition to ones that were there before I lef

**Image 1: Driven Route**

This is an image of an approximate 3.5 mile route I drove. Residential zones are in gray, while yellow zones are commercial properties.[\[10\]](#_ftn10)

In total, I counted 17 different signs advertising space for rent.  
  
One of the signs that stood out most prominently for me was Engvest. I went to their website, where they advertise “over 1 million sqft of property under management”.[\[11\]](#_ftn11)  
  
Going through the total listings I manually collected a dataset (n=96 with at least one redundant entry). the listed spaces were for entire buildings, not units; large amount of rent/sale prices were listed as “negotiable”.

  
Here’s a few included as a reference:

  
  


||
||
|Address|Square Feet|Cost (generally per SF)|Cost (Purchase)|Notes|
|14355 Torrey Chase Blvd | Houston, TX 77014|2900||269900||
|2152 W NW Hwy Ste 122 | Dallas, TX 75220|2515|negotiable|||
|5876 E Berry St. | Fort Worth, TX 76119|12500|7000.00/month(total)||Industrial (note: says $7500 in ad)|
|5611 S Custer Rd. | McKinney, TX 75070|34300|negotiable||Note: digitally rendered photos|
|3811 S Cooper St Ste 2404, Arlington, Tx 76015|714||75000|Actual restaurant|
|10595-10669 HWY 49 | Brookland, AR 72417|546678||435,000.00|Land|
|1818 E Overton Road | Dallas, TX 75216|1800||200000||
|123 Executive Way | Desoto, TX 75115|10800||Call for pricing||

|315 North Greenville Avenue | Richardson, TX 75081|25743.96|negotiable|negotiable||

  
Of note is 3876 E. Berry St., that has a listed price of $500 less per month than what was written in the body of the text, a property that only appeared to be digitally rendered, and an actual, running restaurant (it was BBQ but I forget the brand).

\*Note: I seem to remember the data being different when inputting, so a similar pattern may have occurred elsewhere

 

**Skyscrapers:**  
  
After gathering these data points, I was looking to find a firm in order to investigate further.

I found a company listed as the Texas Hedge Fund Association listed at 1700 Pacific Ave, Dallas, TX, 75201. I went in, talked to security and went to the listed suite #4100; completely vacant.  
  
I went back to the security desk at the front and asked for directions to the 14^(th) floor; that floor was vacant as well (see below).

 

In total, out of the 49 floors in this skyscraper, 20+ were vacant. Below, a snapshot of that property from LoopNet[\[12\]](#_ftn12):

https://preview.redd.it/hv3xgnojicsf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=de8d4535c545616172601bea0a27c33938612aa4

4 stars and A class building. I suspect the A class rating was obtained through renovations, so would anticipate that it gets relegated to “B” in 2026.  
  
**Texas Real Estate Investment Association Pitch:**

I decided to attend an employment/investment pitch held in Dallas, TX. The final two hours being devoted to commercial real estate; the analysis of the speaker was that we were going from a “hot” residential market to a “lukewarm” one. Commercial real estate was were the “big money” was to be made.  
  
Return on investment was projected to be 100% over a five year period, with a standard LTV said to be 70% and a typical rent increase of 10% year.

 At the end, the presenter was asked by the author about office space:

“We don’t invest in any office space, a lot of those properties are selling for $.40 to $.50 on the dollar”.  
  
The author was then talking to a broker seated nearby. Through the conversation, the broker shared that they work as a lender with various insurance companies; with customer premiums (and the lack of payouts through claims), investments were being made in commercial real estate properties. These were largely non-securitized, so they did not have to reference the SOFR benchmark.

 

**Demographic Change and Building Forecasts:**  
  
For this portion of analysis, I am planning to compare demographic changes for metropolitan areas and CRE vacancy/construction (in progress).  
  
Selected entries from a quarterly report from Lee & Associates (Q4 2023 to Q4 2024, Head/Tail):

https://preview.redd.it/s9mel60oicsf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=73f47aaaaadc1bd87a26f3ebf36306872bf3189f

Briefly, on average, cap rate went up, U.S. vacancy rate went up, sale price went down, SF under construction went down, inventory went up.  
**More skyscrapers:**  


https://preview.redd.it/k7qr1lgvicsf1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=00449b2e2ceaeb762d4c34550a8de8fe9fc094ac

  
The green building, from conversations with employees, had an occupancy rate of 70%. The blue building had no permanent tenants (save potentially a café), as it was being converted to apartments.

Below, one of the yellow properties:

https://preview.redd.it/ijzluxfxicsf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4270a522e6e9ea2c17b07a15e8fdfe785cc10b9d

 

Using the smaller of the two estimates: 176,xxx/592,xxx= 70.3% occupancy at best.  
  


**Where does this show up on financial statements?**

A good place to look is on balance sheets of banks that now hold real estate due to foreclosure. Loan origination and loans held for sale are also starting points, but imperfect. If this were to be of material impact, I would expect this to appear (after the fact) in credit profiles. Pre-arranged revolving credit agreements may be a fruitful starting point as well if worst case scenarios are assumed.

**Is this temporary? Are we at the end of a cycle?**

My inclination is no, and that the real impacts well be felt in the coming quarters.

**How can one potentially profit from this?**  
There are multiple ways. My starting point is trying to find regional banks most exposed, non-bank lenders that may be extending loans on properties where the fundamental and market values are different, and (hopefully) analyzing CMBS tranches in more detail to understand if the property loans that underly them are actually as sound as stated.

Sky is the limit, too much noise recently.

UiPath partners with OpenAI to integrate its advanced AI models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-5, into enterprise automation workflows. This collaboration, announced on September 30, 2025, includes a dedicated ChatGPT connector that combines OpenAI's frontier models with UiPath's orchestration tools to speed up AI agent development and deployment. It also features a new benchmark for evaluating computer-use models in agentic automation, along with support for Large Action Models (LAMs) to handle complex business processes. OpenAI models are already embedded in UiPath's Agent Builder, and the company offers official connectors for the OpenAI API in its Marketplace, allowing seamless use of LLMs for tasks like text generation and decision-making. This builds on earlier integrations, such as Azure OpenAI Service via Microsoft, but the direct partnership focuses on enterprise-grade AI enhancements.

It’s puzzling that analysts remain so bullish handing out “Buy” ratings and lofty targets, despite biotech’s high failure rates and frequent 50–90% stock declines.

Would love to hear different perspectives - especially from anyone with biotech investing experience.

1ntyifa,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 20:12:11,DD: why i am all in BITF,"Bitcoin Mining to Gov-Grade AI Cloud?

1. Board Appointment Signals a Pivot

On Aug 18, 2025, Bitfarms appointed Wayne Duso (ex-AWS & Dell) to its Board.

Why this matters: Duso helped scale AWS GovCloud and Dell’s $B+ businesses. His expertise is hyperscale cloud + government compliance (FedRAMP, FISMA, DoD IL5/IL6).

Speculation: Bitfarms may be lining up federal certifications for its Panther Creek (PA) site. These are must-have for handling sensitive workloads like defense AI model training.

Quick primer:

FedRAMP High → secure federal cloud for sensitive but unclassified data.

FISMA High → compliance for “severe consequence” data breaches.

DoD IL5/IL6 → Controlled Unclassified Info (IL5) and Secret (IL6) – critical for DoD AI workloads.

Add Duso’s background → very plausible Bitfarms is positioning Panther Creek for Gov/DoD AI contracts (think AWS-style premium pricing).

2. Revenue Potential – AI Cloud vs. Mining

Industry benchmarks (2025):

AI Data Centers: ~$12.5M/MW gross → ~$5–7M/MW net in PA.

Colocation: ~$1.3–1.5M/MW (TeraWulf).

CoreWeave (PA): ~$6M/MW.

Texas & NY AI Cloud: $4–6M/MW (more volatility + higher energy costs).

Panther Creek specifics:

1 GW potential → scale to 500+ MW.

Nuclear + hydro power at $0.02–0.03/kWh via PJM grid (super cheap).

80% NOI margins if certified + locked with a hyperscaler (Amazon, etc.).

At $5–7M/MW, Panther Creek could generate $2.5–3.5B/year net if 500 MW is deployed.

3. Quebec Pilot – AMD MI300X Advantage

Early 2025, Bitfarms repurposed part of its Saint-Hyacinthe (QC) site (~50 MW) for AMD MI300X racks:

Memory Edge: 192 GB HBM3 vs. H100’s 80 GB → fewer GPUs needed for large models.

Cost: $15–20K vs. $30K+ H100 → ~20–30% lower TCO.

Efficiency: 750W TDP; Quebec pilot hit 85% GPU utilization on vLLM inference.

Software: ROCm 6.0+ now supports PyTorch + Hugging Face.

If scaled at Panther Creek:

Revenue boost → $6–8M/MW (thanks to AMD’s pricing + cheap power).

Quebec tests already yield 2–3x mining margins.

4. Talent & Partners Lining Up

James Bond (yes, real name) hired as SVP of HPC on Mar 26, 2025 → likely behind the Quebec AI pilot.

T5 Data Centers provides lifecycle ops, certifications, and multi-year contracts → exactly the type of partner hyperscalers demand.

Locations = edge:

Pennsylvania: Cheap/stable nuclear, undersea fiber routes to EU/Africa, political support for data centers.

Washington: Hydro < $0.03/kWh, West Coast hub with fiber routes to Asia.

5. The Big Picture

Bitfarms is quietly building an AWS-style AI/GovCloud pivot → with nuclear-backed capacity, AMD MI300X pilots, and GovCloud talent.

If certifications + hyperscaler deal land (Amazon is the obvious candidate), Panther Creek could turn into one of the highest-margin AI data centers in North America.

Bitcoin mining may become the “side hustle”; AI cloud could be the real money printer.


TLDR:

Wayne Duso (ex-AWS GovCloud) joins Bitfarms → signaling FedRAMP/DoD ambitions.

Panther Creek (PA) could net $5–7M/MW/year, scaling to multi-B revenue.

Quebec pilot proves AMD MI300X racks = cheaper, more efficient vs. NVIDIA.

Talent + partners (James Bond, T5 Data Centers) strengthen the case.

Locations in PA + WA give Bitfarms strategic energy + fiber advantages.

Speculation but very plausible: Bitfarms is morphing from BTC miner → AI cloud Gov/DoD player.",201,86,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/vpvwexcf27sf1.jpeg,new,DD,0.91

First play was UNH Jan 400 calls. I opened the position in mid-July, then doubled down and averaged heavy on August 1 when UNH flushed to \~240. Bagheld through Buffet pump to 320, the dump back to 290, and finally unloaded on the rip to \~342. Paper hands would’ve been obliterated, but I diamond-handed it until the pop to \~342 and cashed out those calls.  
[Screenshot 2: UNH buy and sell orders](https://imgur.com/OOg0VQs)

With fresh ammo, I went heavy into FIGMA/LIGMA when it cratered from 140 into the 50s. Snagged it around $51.9, rode it up, and dumped at $58.4.

And then the final boss: went all-in on TTD at $44.18 average.  
[Screenshot 3: Order history — UNH, FIG, TTD trades](https://imgur.com/7qf3zFv)

Now I’m just holding 40k shares of TTD, sitting at just over **$2M**.

Plan from here: looking to cash out around $55–60 on TTD. After that, might take my tendies and start scooping up some beachside condos in Mexico. Real estate can’t rug you with one bad earnings call.

Not financial advice, just the dumbest smart luck I’ve ever had. 🍻

Trump will rig $INTC to go up, forcing companies to partner with them and build their foundry business, for national security and his pride.  


INTC has a trump put, if he sees the stock starting to struggle, he will manipulate it back up.  It’s embarrassing for him to buy a stock with the governments money and watch it go down, especially since he’s known as a business man.  A lot of bad press will occur.

WSJ Reports that the Trump Admin has committed to help intel “find new customers to bolster the foundry business”$TSM is at $1T vs $INTC $150b, a lot of room to runA single meaningfully 14a foundry contract by Apple, xAI, open ai, etc will send INTC up 30%+ overnight.  Why would these companies not at least baby commit to this, to appease trump and get favorable treatment in the future?The US is the most powerful country in the world, and to have that in your back pocket of a company is a scary cheat code.  US takes their national security seriously, and they will insure Intel wins.

Reasons for it to go down

Trump announces he doesn’t care about onshoring US semi manufacturing anymore and shifts policy to globalist mentality and allows free trade of semis

US sells 10% stake in INTC

Reasons for it to go up

Announcement of new investor

Announcement of big company supporting intel

1ntoip7,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 13:37:11,"CRISPR ($CRSP) - Sector Tailwinds, Insider Buys & Massive SI","**Hello again, Donald Pump here,**

I hope you are all enjoying the major tendies of my previous 3 posts. I am back again with a new idea which could just sequence brilliant autist genes into future WSB degens for generations to come... 

**CRISPR Therapeutics ($CRSP) - Sector Tailwinds, Insider Buys & Massive SI:**

* I know what you’re going to say: “But Donald, I bought this with Cathie Wood in 2021 and now I am down 70%.” And while that may be true, it’s never too late to make it all back in one trade.

**Regulatory and Political Tide Turning**

* QURE’s new gene therapy essentially cured Huntington’s disease. This is a rising tide lifts all boats moment for gene therapy, and CRSP is the OG.
* The government is already all over this – RFK has supported fast tracking experimental gene therapies, and just this month the FDA published additional guidance on how to navigate this process. There’s now more focus and more eyeballs on this space than ever.
   * **From Reuters**:  [US Health Secretary Kennedy looks to fast-tracking approvals for rare disease drugs](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-health-secretary-kennedy-looks-fast-tracking-approvals-rare-disease-drugs-2025-06-05/)
   * **From Politico:** ""The FDA Published a series of gene-therapy draft guidance on expedited development and review, methods to capture product safety and efficacy data after approval and innovative clinical trial design for the therapies in small populations.""

**Insider Buys**

* There are rarely insider buys at this company. Look at this chart. The last time insiders bought was the stone cold bottom of the taper tantrum in 2018.
   * In July, Simeon George bought $50mm of stock through his fund, SR One. He has been on the board since 2015 and we have not seen anything like this from him before.
   * Another board member, Douglas Treco bought $1mm in August. He has been on the board since 2020 and we have not seen anything like this from him before.
* When insiders who have been with the company for years start buying millions of dollars in the open market, it’s time to pay attention. 

**Fortress Balance Sheet**

* The company has $1.7B in cash and hardly any debt. This is enough to fund operations for years.

**Shrt Interest**

* Last but not least, shrt interest is **30%**! This is about as high as It’s ever been. CRSP is not going to run out of money and it now has a narrative tailwind.
* Q4 is news-heavy for biotech's ahead of the JPM conference in January. For CRSP specifically, keep an eye out for a November heart conference update on its one-shot cholesterol program, faster rollout stats for its sickle-cell gene-editing treatment, and any tidbits on its cancer cell therapy pipeline.

**TLDR:** There is more excitement in the gene therapy space than there has been in years. Insiders are buying, the company has a lot of cash, and shrt interest is just way too high.

**Disclosure:** I am not a biotech analyst, I am just a retard with a Bloomberg terminal. NFA DYOR.

**Position:** JAN 80s

1ntofvm,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 13:34:11,JBS N.V. DD,"JBS: An Investment Thesis
The Bull Case (Pros)
The U.S. beef industry is a  case study in supply-side economics. The fundamental bull case for JBS is not about today's price, currently $14.65 at writing, but about the multi-year tailwinds that are set to drive profitability. Analysis shows that JBS is a long-term play.

1. Low herd count : A Long-Term Tailwind
The single most powerful catalyst is the U.S. cattle herd, which has shrunk to its lowest since the 1950s. This is a structural issue that will take years to resolve. While a tight supply of livestock is a headwind for JBS in the short term, it is a massive long-term benefit. The futures market for live cattle is already pricing this in, with contracts for April 2026 and beyond trading at a premium. This indicates the market believes we are in a seller's market and beef prices will persist, allowing JBS to command higher prices.

2. Diversification and a growing global market 
JBS's strength lies in its diversified portfolio. The company's U.S. beef business may be facing headwinds, but its other segments are thriving. The company's poultry (Pilgrim's Pride) and pork businesses in the U.S. and its international operations in Australia and Brazil are consistently delivering strong profits. 
This diversification acts as a crucial hedge against the volatility of the U.S. beef market, allowing the company to remain profitable even when its largest segment is facing negative margins. The company's ability to maintain profitability in a challenging environment is a testament to the resilience of its business model.


3. Strategic Investments and Growth Catalysts
JBS N.V. is not sitting back idly; it's actively investing in its future. The company is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to modernize its U.S. facilities, which will increase capacity and efficiency. The company is also making strategic acquisitions, such as its new plant in Iowa, to expand into higher-margin, value-added products like ready-to-eat bacon. The company's new dual listing on the NYSE under the ticker JBS is a major catalyst that will attract more institutional investors and increase the stock's liquidity and visibility.

4. Noticeable spike dates: 8/29, 9/2, 9/3
Current short position is 24 million shares representing 7% of the outstanding float. This represents a 24% increase from the prior month. 

The Bear Case (Cons)
While the long-term outlook for JBS is strong, investors must also be aware of the significant short-term risks and headwinds. The bearish case for JBS is not a bet against the long-term cycle, but a bet on the timing and the potential for new threats to emerge.

1. Narrow profit margin is real 
JBS's profitability is a major short-term concern. The company's North American beef division reported a negative EBITDA, a direct result of the high cost of livestock. While the company's other segments are profitable, the negative margins in its largest business segment are a significant headwind that could impact future earnings and dampen investor enthusiasm.

2. Regulatory and political uncertainty 
The U.S. beef industry is an oligopoly, and this market concentration has attracted the attention of regulators and politicians. The company faces the risk of antitrust lawsuits and new regulations that could impact its business model and profitability. While these risks are difficult to quantify, they are a significant factor in the company's valuation. The company also faces political risks from a potential U.S. tariff on Brazilian beef, which could affect its global supply chain.

3. The Risk of a slow recovery 
The bullish thesis on JBS is based on the idea that the U.S. cattle herd will begin rebuilding in late 2027. However, this timeline is not guaranteed. A sustained drought or other macroeconomic factors could delay the recovery, which would prolong the company's profitability struggles and erode the time value of a long-term call option.

4. The business model not without flaws
JBS's core business model is a low-margin, high-volume operation. The company is highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, and it has to pay for a massive supply chain, a significant cost. The company's focus on diversifying into new business segments is a sign that it is aware of these risks, pivoting to a higher-margin business is not guaranteed to be successful.

5. The Options market pricing 
An astute options trader would recognize that even though JBS's options were a good value when bought and better value now based on historical volatility and implied volatility. 
they are now trading at a premium. The market is now pricing in the very catalysts investors have been waiting for. A buyer of options at this point is paying a higher premium for the same potential reward. 
Peer  comparison  and conclusion
Peer Comparison: JBS vs the ""Big Four""
To truly understand JBS's valuation and strategic position, it is essential to compare it to its peers.
 * Tyson Foods (TSN): Tyson is JBS's direct competitor. both companies are facing headwinds in their beef segments, Tyson's greater vertical integration in its poultry business and its stronger brand recognition in prepared foods give it a slight advantage. However, JBS's global scale and direct exposure to the Brazilian and Australian beef markets make it a more direct play on the global beef cycle.
   * Stock Price: ~ $54.50
   * P/E Ratio: ~ 24x
 * JBS (JBS):
   * Stock Price: ~ $15.50
   * P/E Ratio: ~ 7.5x to 15x
The earnings multiplier (P/E ratio) shows that JBS is currently trading at a significant discount to its main publicly traded competitor, Tyson Foods. This suggests that the market is valuing JBS's stock at a lower multiple of its earnings, which could be an opportunity for a long-term investor who believes in the company's ability to return to higher profitability.
 * Cargill & National Beef: Two companies are privately held, which means their financial performance is not publicly disclosed. However, their presence is critical to understanding the oligopoly structure of the U.S. beef industry. The fact that the ""Big Four"" control 85% of the market is a key factor in JBS's long-term profitability.

Conclusion
The debate between the bull and bear case is a classic one. The optimal strategy is to synthesize both views and create a forward-looking plan that maximizes potential while mitigating risk. A recommended way forward is to:
Monitor the key catalyst 
A successful trade is based on a clear thesis and well-defined catalysts. The most important catalysts to monitor are:
 * The Cattle Herd: The USDA's forecasts for the US cattle herd are the most important metric to watch. A clear sign that the herd is beginning to grow would be a massive signal to the market.
 * The Global Business: Monitor the performance of JBS's other business segments. Continued profitability in poultry and pork would give confidence that the company can navigate the headwinds in its U.S. beef business.
 * Analyst Ratings: The recent ratings from JPMorgan and B of A  are pointing in the right direction. A sustained period of positive ratings and price targets would be a powerful signal that the market is finally coming around to a new way of thinking.
The Risk vs Reward
This trade is now a bet on a specific outcome, that the market will continue to re-rate JBS's stock to a valuation that is more in line with its long-term potential and peers

1nti6ab,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 09:34:17,YOLOing 50k into The $HI Acquisition Play,"Alright you fellow degenerates and gamblers, gather round. Forget Nvidia AI GPUs for a sec, I found the ultimate boomer stock with the most WSB energy imaginable: **Hillenbrand ($HI)**. Yeah, I know, sounds like a law firm or a casket company. Spoiler: it *was* a casket company. Now it makes boring plastic machines for Nestle and General Mills. Yup, exciting stuff.

So why should you care? Because some **private equity giga-chads (Apollo, Lone Star, Stellex)** are sniffing around like wolves at a nursing home buffet.

Here’s the kicker:

* EBITDA = \~$418M
* Normal boring industrial buyouts go for \~9–10× EBITDA
* Do the math: that’s a buyout price of \~$3.7–$4.0B EV → translates to about **$33–$36 per share**.
* Stock is sitting at $26.6. Bruh.

Now the fun part. Some **smart money lad yeeted $1.5M+ into $HI $30 calls expiring in November** right before close on Friday.

So we’ve got:

* Real buyers (Apollo don’t mess around).
* Real EBITDA math saying $33–36/share is the sweet spot.
* A PE bidding war.
* A random whale throwing $1.5M into illiquid calls like it’s a DraftKings parlay.

My dumb brain translation: either this dies in a ditch and we all lose money, or we get the juiciest $7–10/share tendie pop when a deal hits. My guess? **70% chance this goes through, 30% chance we’re bagholders crying into our Costco caskets**

So obivously, I YOLO'ed 50k into it. If you want exposure to *actual* smart money degeneracy instead of lotto scratchers on SPY weeklies, $HI might be the boomer rocket you never expected.

Based on my analysis target price: **$33–36**.  
Expiration date: **hopefully before our (at least mine) contracts do.**

TL;DR This company was killing it before tariff, still making a lot of things, all in the US of A. There's a bidding war and company will be acquired, I expect 7-8x EBITDA, so based on some sophisticated advanced complicated math, I think stocks will be at least $33 once it's announced or goes through.

Background: the stock selection is based on a multi factor model, and the option selection is even more complicated, but the spreads are simple vertical spreads so that if the stock is above the short strike the spread will be at max profit.

Tldr snap has begun and likely will continue to print.

I will be trading in and out for the next 6 months.





Adding dd here for context (dyor not financial advice etc etc)


Here's the thesis in short:

1. Snap went public at a 23 billion dollar valuation and had 404 million in revenue, now they are at a 14 billion dollar valuation and have 5.3 billion in revenue. 

2. They have a billion monthly active users, more than 12% of the world population.

3. They are making a push to permanent net profit, they launched a subscription model in 2022 (called Snapchat+), it's now at 700 million in revenue and grew 60% y/y in q1 2025 to 15 million users. Highly expect this to continue to grow at a tier 1 rate. (3 days ago they announced if you have more than 5gb of storage you'll pay $1.99 a month or can subscribe to snapchat+ for 3.99 a month, this should move the numbers too in a very strong way)

4. Evan wrote a letter to employees and shareholders a little while back, (I'm paraphrasing here) highlighting how he's not happy where the company is at, their competitors are all valued at 5x-100x them, and if they execute properly there could be startup like returns on their publicly traded stock

5. Their stock dropped at last earnings due to a technical one time error in their ad pricing software, this has been corrected and hasn't been priced into the stock. Stock is trading at a valuation that implies doom.


Oh and a Saudi prince buying up the company. (Now owns 2.5%)

1ns8te3,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 18:56:00,Follow up on my stock market journey,"Following up on my stock journey. About 6 months ago, I posted my portfolio gains at about 1200% in a little over 6-7 months. In about another 4-5 months time frame, I got the portfolio up to $80K and now back down to $74K.

Strategy is still the same and simple, buy low sell high. Obvious right?

Well, the biggest key strategy or let’s say mindset shift when I started winning is getting desensitized to money. Build a high conviction play, stick to it, DCA if it is lower and company stays the same, and don’t get stop lossed too early.

One of my biggest wins this year was UNH. It is a high value company, got some bad news and dropped like a rock. Market tends to OVERREACT ALWAYS and on either sides too. Bad news = overreact to the downside, then price rebounds to stabilize. Same way on the upside, good news = price surge overreaction and will correct to the range. I bought the dip at around $300 kept DCA to $290 and sold at $350. (I’m back in)

I also study macro trends, and market sentiment. Right now, market is ATH, overall sentiment is bullish HOWEVER, short term wise there is a lot of fear baked into the market. So, theoretically, if traders see big red candles, the downside pressure is higher. So I will be a bear and short most of the day if market is red, looks weak and I don’t see that V shape recovery that I usually see. (Indices did this past week)

I also study the price action, I don’t care about RSIs, MACD trends, etc those are all historical indicators. Nobody will know what the price will do next. But if you really take a look at the chart in one minute frame and study how it behaves: for example AMD, a lot of the time I noticed in the morning it shoots up 2-3%, market is not too bullish, I will scale in my puts because I know that there are no bullish news on AMD and that I notice that the price fades most of the time.

There are other strategies that I use, for example having QQQ SPY up with AMD, where QQQ will drop and AMD will drop in a delayed manner (30-60 seconds after) and might take advantage of that knowledge. A lot more to this, and can explain further.

Currently I am in BMNR and UNH as my two holdings, but unsure of market October. We were supposed to drop September and I feel as if market will drop October and rally into holiday season. But I don’t know that yet, need more data thus still in my positions long.

1nrvnxd,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 09:46:36,Upcoming OKLO Catalysts That Could Push It to $200+,"**TL;DR**: The biggest near-term catalysts for Oklo ($OKLO) are (1) Regulatory licensing filings with reduced fees now in effect, and (2) LOIs converting into binding PPAs with data centers/hyperscalers. DOE programs, insider alignment with Sam Altman/OpenAI, analyst coverage, and operational milestones round out the key drivers.

Disclaimer: This post is for informational purposes only and is not financial advice. It reflects analysis and opinions based on publicly available information, and any price targets or scenarios discussed are speculative. Investors should do their own research, consider their risk tolerance, and consult a licensed financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

⸻

**1. COL submission + reduced fees**:
The most important inflection would be Oklo submitting its Combined License (COL) or amendment under Part 52. A formal filing or acceptance letter moves the company onto a clear regulatory track toward construction/operation, reducing uncertainty and drawing institutional interest. Timing is favorable: as of Oct 1, the regulatory body lowered hourly rates for advanced reactor reviews, cutting licensing costs and making a filing even more attractive.

**2. LOIs → binding PPAs**:
Revenue visibility is the other big catalyst. Oklo already has public agreements and LOIs with data center operators (including a 12 GW framework with Switch). The next step is converting these into binding PPAs or project-level offtake contracts. If a hyperscaler or large operator signs a binding deal, it would instantly validate Oklo’s commercial model and likely re-rate the stock.

**3. DOE programs and pilot selection**:
Oklo has been selected under DOE pilot initiatives, and further DOE funding awards, pilot milestones, or fast-track inclusions would be visible de-risking events. Federal recognition both improves credibility and makes financing easier.

**4. Insider support (Sam Altman & OpenAI)**:
Filings show Sam Altman’s Hydrazine Capital still holds ~3.15M shares. Beyond that, Altman is also CEO of OpenAI, which has been clear about the massive energy requirements to scale AI compute. In a recent blog post, he said OpenAI will soon announce energy partnerships and new financing ideas. With his dual role and financial stake, Oklo is a logical partner candidate. Any announcement connecting the two would be a blockbuster catalyst.

**5. Analyst coverage shifts**:
Goldman Sachs recently initiated at $117 PT while others like Wedbush sit higher at $150+. Coverage from major desks matters because it shapes fund flows, especially if sentiment consolidates more bullish.

**6. Operational milestones**:
Incremental updates- site permits, readiness assessments, procurement contracts, or construction financing- are less flashy but reduce execution risk. Analysts track these closely, and they matter for building institutional confidence.

**7. Short-interest dynamics (secondary)**:
Borrow availability for OKLO has been tight at times, which means positive headlines can spark outsized moves. Serious investors usually don’t trade on this, but it helps explain volatility and is relevant for tactical positioning.

⸻

If Oklo successfully executes on its near-term milestones; including regulatory licensing, binding PPAs, and partnerships with entities like OpenAI- some analysts and investors suggest that a price target of **$200+** could be achievable, reflecting the company’s long-term growth potential in the nuclear energy sector.

[**Here’s**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/qp3BDzfZxs) my last post from 10 months ago, where I predicted that $OKLO would overtake $SMR in market capitalization.

1nrki5j,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 23:03:04,30k yolo call on OPEN,"I’ve got \~$30k in long calls on Opendoor ($OPEN). Here’s why I think this stock is positioned for both long-term growth and a potential market re-rating.

# 1. Undervalued Relative to Market

* **Market Cap:** \~$7B, which is tiny compared to the multi-trillion U.S. housing transaction market. Even a modest share of this market justifies a higher valuation.
* **Valuation:** Price-to-sales multiples remain compressed compared to other real estate tech players. If margins improve, OPEN has serious rerating potential.
* **Operations:** Risk management has improved, inventory exposure is down, and operating losses are narrowing. They’re not circling the drain - they’re stabilizing.

# 2. AI Integration Push

* CEO Kaz Nejatian recently sent out a company wide email regarding having employees have a more AI centric approach. (Can check his last X post)

* This suggests OPEN is evolving into a **data-driven housing platform**, not just a home-flipping company.
* Early adoption and daily AI use among employees show this is more than a PR move — it’s an operational shift.

# 3. Leadership Upgrade

* Kaz Nejatian is the new CEO, and this is a big deal. Before OPEN, he was COO at **Shopify**, where he played a key role in scaling one of the most successful e-commerce platforms of the past decade.
* Shopify stock went up around 600%+ during his time at Shopify.
* Strong, proven leadership is often overlooked in stock pricing but can dramatically improve execution and investor confidence.

# 4. Why Now

* **Technical Setup:** Chart has broken out of consolidation, with momentum building.
* **Macro:** Housing headwinds are well known and arguably priced in. Even stabilization could trigger sentiment reversal.
* **Catalysts:** New CEO narrative, AI integration, and upcoming earnings are all potential positive triggers.

**Conclusion:**  
$OPEN looks mispriced for what it’s becoming: a leaner, AI-powered housing platform with a strong CEO who has scaled complex businesses before. With improved operations and a push into tech-driven growth, this is a value play with real upside.

**TL;DR:**

* \~$7B market cap vs. multi-trillion housing market = undervalued.
* AI integration = real operational advantage compared to other real-estate companies.
* New CEO Kaz Nejatian (ex-Shopify COO) = strong leadership.
* Long-term bullish — I’m in with \~$30k calls.

About 3 weeks ago I made a play on $CRWV $105 calls when it was sitting around $98 and posted here about it. That move ended up being a 10 bagger when it shot up all the way to $120.

  
I see another huge opportunity on $CRWV now. This stock is one of the backbones of the AI cloud computing play. There was just a monster dip on literally zero news, so I'm betting hard on a rebound next week. 

  
They keep racking up monster deals with big players in the AI space, and spend on cloud compute isn't going anywhere anytime soon. I foresee a run to $135+ next week.

  
Position: 500 x $CRWV $130 calls expiring Oct 3rd.

And at that point I knew there was something up with the Nebius chart that I had to do DD on. 

And then I realized the it was like when Sword Art Online came out. It was off to a good start then fell off season 2, which is why the chart declined. 

Then we see star symbols of waifs. I can't read Japanese, but I know it's cute. So stock price went up. 

Then it got replaced when demon slayer came out. the movie was great. And that's when we get serious with the TA. Tanjiro's hairline is spotted on the 1 month chart. That means it does have something to do with Demon Slayer. And because if we analyze the macro environment of the spike of Nezuko Body pillows by 80% after the Demon Slayer movie, we should also see a 80% spike in WEebius group.

Tanjiro always gets up after he gets beaten up, which is just manic character anime plot armor. Even despite a drop today, NBIUS will keep getting back up and going up because it's overpowered.

AI runs on GPUs, right? RIGHT?

The answer is it depends. And most people (including developers) don't know that, but they will know, eventually

Let's begin with memory bandwidth from now on BW

Each token generation requires accessing ALL model weights, that means for each output token you need to load the entire model so how fast you load that model in memory, for that bw was the major limitation of CPUs ultill the next gen

The current top xeon has 0.614TB/s which is a ton, and could be working on dual configuration with 6TB RAM at 1,7TB/s but Top GPUs like A100 have 2TB/s and H100 has 3TB/s, the next generation of Intel Xeon 18A is expected to have \~2TB/s. Positioning near A100.

BW tl;dr: \*\*Usually doubling bandwidth roughly doubles token generation speed  
BW deepdive:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is\_inferencing\_memory\_bandwidth\_limited/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is_inferencing_memory_bandwidth_limited/)



Let's keep going, usually big chunk papa models cannot and will not work on a CPU period, but advances in quantization(from now on Q\_) made possible to run big papa models like gpt-oss 120b run on a CPU with a loss in accuracy near to 2%

Usually models are based on 16B and Q\_ down to 8 or 4, each time you half the number of bits, it halves the model size. For example GPT-OSS could run Q\_8 with only 60GB what makes possible to run at any modern workstation CPU RAM. You have 2 modules of 32GB DDR5? Boom you can run Q\_ big papa models

Q\_ tl;dr: CPUs can run big models on RAM now

Q\_ deepdive: [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/)

[https:\/\/developer.nvidia.com\/blog\/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization\/](https://preview.redd.it/xjqr7wqojcrf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b50372aec5d17a684cfa3882534067d4bd58844)

Let's talk about money, while a GPU is the king and surpasses the CPU in every metric possible, CPUs are crazy energy efficient and versatile, but what does it mean? It means that server providers are more prone to buy a CPU because they have a wider set of applications, and not only inference so they can have less idle time and more money back from their chips, since we discussed earlier, not everyone needs the biggest model available and token generation speed in new Xeon processors with CPU tokens per second sucks vs GPU they are not even close, but! Look at performance:

[https:\/\/www.nscale.com\/blog\/cpu-inferencing-why-not](https://preview.redd.it/8h79t8kqjcrf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3f3f23a5491adf4064be81e5af3be9a53dd86c)

Oh boy, you can bet small to mid-sized businesses are going to notice this, since this graph is not suitable for large environments where inference is handled by a cluster using vLLM or other software that allows load distribution and pipeline parallelism.

And they are not only crazy efficient but Intel is positioning at the most competitive chips for LLM inference per dollar:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel\_6944p\_the\_most\_cost\_effective\_cpu\_solution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel_6944p_the_most_cost_effective_cpu_solution/)

Lastly, the necessity of private LLM execution for small and mid-sized businesses is a niche that perfectly meets CPU inference.

[https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/](https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/)

On top of all of this, Intel and NVIDIA reached an agreement which announcement literally says: ""For data centers, Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market.""  
[https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products](https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products)  
So you can bet every board in a data center that works with Nvidia will have an Intel-manufactured CPU, which means that NVIDIA could be one of the first clients of the new Foundries that could be followed by other manufacturers and fabless chip designers.

tl;dr: buy intel

I know this position is risky, I might roll but this is why I’m here:

The idea is simple: insiders are loading up right as the company locks in real LNG growth and heads into winter. In the last week directors filed multiple open-market buys: William Vrattos purchased 100,000 shares at a weighted average $6.864, Edward Andrew Scoggins Jr. bought 15,000 shares around $6.46, and a separate Form 4 shows director Jason Dillow’s purchase disclosed on Sept 18–19. These are actual “P” code buys, not grants, and total seven figures of fresh skin in the game.

Why now matters. On Sept 9 NextDecade reached positive FID and financial close on Rio Grande LNG Train 4, and management guided that Train 5’s FID is expected before Nov 15 after recently signing a 1.5 MTPA, 20 year SPA with EQT for Train 5 volumes. Winter gas demand historically tightens the LNG tape, and sector prints like Sempra’s Port Arthur Phase 2 FID this week underscore that U.S. LNG build-out is still accelerating into year end.

The setup is that real project de-risking plus visible commercial deals plus unusually large insider buying can force a rerate from distressed expectations. With shares around the mid-$7s today, the near-term upside case is straightforward: Train 5 financing headlines or additional SPAs into winter could be the next leg while insider conviction anchors the floor. Size it like a volatile mid-cap LNG developer and respect headline risk, but the combination of fresh director money, new FIDs, and contracted volumes is exactly the kind of catalyst stack that can keep propelling this higher.",581,184,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nptl01,new,DD,0.92

1npru94,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 19:48:15,"Is Gold Overbought Or Is There Still More Upside Left? Here's Our
Simple Technical Analysis and Thoughts.","Gold is now at $3760ish at the time of this post and holding, but is the momentum going to continue, or will we see a pause in the price movement upwards? Having been a Precious Metals Analyst since 2005, here are my thoughts...

I think this recent bull market in gold started once it cleared $2100 and broke out to the upside, which happened in March of 2024, mostly from Central Bank buying and investor demand. Since then, it's been on a gradual ascent upwards with some pauses and consolidations before making the next leg higher. At the beginning of this year, the US started bringing lots of gold from London (LBMA) and shipping it to the US, let's say at a price of about $2800-$3000. This is something I haven't seen in 20 years, so I think that puts a floor on the price of Gold at $3000, I don't think we will ever see gold under $3000 ever again, unless we get a MAJOR BlackSwan event and total all markets liquidation, and even then, that $3000 price of gold could hold as the floor.

So, currently at $3750, can gold continue higher to $4000? Yes, I think so. The rate drop cycle that has started in the US is one of the factors that caused gold to break out of the $3300-$3400 consolidation price range this summer. If we get more interest rate drops, I think Gold goes to $4000, based on this alone, but how much further it goes beyond that is yet to be seen. I would be happy with $4000 on gold in the next few months, or maybe into early next year.

There is a seasonality to gold price movements, but since the beginning of 2024, it hasn't followed the normal patterns, and I think that's because this new bull market started then, and probably has many more years ahead of us. But once the interest rate drop cycle ends, gold will have peaked out and may retrace back to major uptrend support lines, and consolidate for the next major move, up or down.

These are just some of my initial thoughts, and I will continue to pop in on this REDDIT once and awhile to share more thoughts and updates if people here are interested. ",0,43,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/dlg1dqxx87rf1.png,new,Discussion,0.37

Basically this is a company specializing in next-generation power semiconductors, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) technologies. These are used in high-growth areas like AI data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), mobile charging, and renewable energy.

•  NVTS eyeing revival through NVIDIA AI synergies—volume’s solid, but P/E flags caution. Buybacks could turbocharge if fundamentals align; divested $100M+ last year signals pivot potential.

•  Risk-reward tightening.. Upside from scale-ups and partnerships; downside on costs/delays.

•  Pre-market buzz tied to EV/AI tailwinds—partnership expansions and earnings guidance in focus.

•  Shares breaking 50-day MA on volume—technical setup for extension if momentum holds.

•  Despite revenue dip, EV/semi growth narrative intact—optimism hinges on delivery.

Not financial advice, DYOR, but if AI infrastructure bottlenecks persist (hello, NVIDIA Blackwell), NVTS could be the under-the-radar winner. At the current price, I’d say the room to run is to $16 after $9 breaks. We saw this on APLD. This narrative is the play.

Q3 earnings Nov 3 could spotlight AI progress; ECCE and WiPDA conferences in Oct/Nov for tech showcases; CES 2026 prep might drop EV bombshells via VREMT.

Currently sitting on $390 strike 11/21 puts with enough contracts to make or break my entire existence. Average cost was higher, but I averaged down with more today at $17.80.

This stock has been pumping harder than Elon at an earnings call, but every rocket runs out of fuel. Earnings + macro + overextension = setup for a rug pull.

If Tesla slides under $400, I print. If it nukes back to $372–$361 breakeven, I’m sure retiring with my tendies.

If not? Well, I’ll be the next WSB legend who donated $100k+ to this casino. 🎰

6 YEARSS OF PAIN AND MENTAL TORTURE.

Bought 100 contracts 130C on 8/12/24 with 12/19/25 Expiry. Sold before today’s pop :( and they’re worth $52ish last I checked but whatever.

Honestly I wish I never found this sub, I can’t remember the last time I didn’t file the 3k loss on my taxes. I just kept putting money into random options while scouring this sub.

At the worst point I had lost 120k of my own hard earned money. Throughout the years I had made the money back through some crazy WSB plays (GymeStonk, Iron net, etc) and within a couple days I’d be back to a huge loss. 

I finally started looking for value plays with LEAPS and my biggest option play were these BABA calls. I bought them with a year and a half DTE with half of my account value. For some reason I wanted to hold for at least a year because I had a feeling and here we are. It was hard to stomach the ups and down constantly but it paid off.
I think I’m done for a long time, I keep checking Robinhood for my next play out of habit but I think I’m going to delete the app after withdrawing it all. I put most of my BP in SGOV for now for dividends.

My advice: If you’re young and naive and lurking in this sub, don’t start trading options, I honestly got lucky. Maybe use a small percentage of your income for risky plays but not your entire investing budget like I did.

Thanks regards, I learned a lot from this sub and maybe I’ll be back in a couple of years but for now, goodbye and good luck.",622,67,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1npfnze,new,Gain,0.96

Since I posted my last bullish thesis some crazy stuff happened, notably the DoD discovered that they couldn’t solely rely on SpaceX and Elmo because when he’s on his periods dude just goes  nuts 🌰

This fact alone serves as an insurance policy for Neutron’s future, ensuring it becomes instantly essential for the DoD

But if this is not enough here is a list of catalysts coming Rocket Lab way by end of year, 

Possible wins over contracts : 

- SDA (different layers) worth $500M+
- Mars Telecom Orbiter worth $700M 
- Mars Sample Return worth $4B 
- Golden Dome contracts (total project will be $175B+) 

Company catalysts : 

- Neutron on the pad 
- New Neutron commercial contracts 
- Neutron launch 
- EBITDA > 0 

Neutron is a structural change within the company that will bring Billions in revenue over the years, couple it with the current market conditions and it gives you rocket fuel 🥁 for one of the best positioned company of the next 10+ years

1np10yv,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 22:47:55,Just bought TTD,"I saw a DD here on TTD a few days ago and decided to jump in. They are the market leader in what they do. Some will say it’s overvalued. Well, in my experience market doesn’t run on overvalued or undervalued, only on emotions. 
Price seems pretty low currently so I bought in.

The Trade Desk (TTD) continues to demonstrate its strength as a long-term investment in the evolving digital advertising space. The company’s robust demand-side platform enables advertisers to manage and optimize data-driven campaigns across various channels, including connected TV (CTV)—a segment growing rapidly as traditional TV declines. CEO Jeff Green has previously stated, “We process more transactions in one day than Visa does in a year,” underscoring the scale and efficiency of their real-time bidding architecture. TTD’s platform is built on transparency and independence, positioning it well against walled gardens like Google and Meta.

Institutional confidence in TTD is also rising. Notably, Intech Investment Management LLC boosted its stake by over 5,700%, Los Angeles Capital Management LLC initiated a $68.6 million position, and ARK Invest (Cathie Wood) recently added 210,664 shares (~$29.5M) to its ARKW fund. LaFleur & Godfrey LLC and several others have also increased exposure. These large bets from respected hedge funds signal strong conviction in TTD’s scalability and future cash flow.

Given its proven leadership, deep industry integration, and consistent innovation in programmatic ad tech, TTD is well-positioned for long-term growth—especially as advertisers shift more spend toward measurable, real-time channels like CTV.

Not a professional, and never made a DD before, but it still feels like space and Nuclear are on a roll of sorts, and have more to come in the future. Maybe buying into RYCEY right now is worth a shot?

\[FINAL UPDATE: Sold out for \~5% profit after 8 days\]

Options were kinda expensive on this one so I didn't think they were underpriced. Being said - lots of shit / potential catalysts around this one that I am unsure if market has priced in yet. Look at all NVDA's recent partnerships (OpenAI in particular - I'm looking at you). I believe micron provides the memory for nvidia GPU's and it may have potential to go brr. Dunno - it's an ER play. I actually don't really know what these guys do to be honest, just lots of chatter & I blindly trusted chat. I'm likely rotating out of micron within a week. These were bought this morning as I rotated out of $SNAP calls. I didn't like how options were priced on this one so monkeyed into shares instead.

It's already ran 40% last month, so high risk. I love buying the top.

Goodluck to all in the cino

\[Update\] Literally flat. Boring. My call about options being overpriced was correct, these are up \~0.5% if AH holds tomorrow. Glad I bought shares & didn't play options here. Theta gang printing tho. I'm up like 5-10k on the AH movement. Theta gang & shares won this one.

\[Update 2\] Might make like 1.5-2% on these tomorrow. Seems to be trending upwards. Lots of people bullish in the other threads - suggesting a hold is an alright bet. My read about overpriced vol seems to be correct tho - options are not the play on this one. I'll update chat when I exit. Goodluck to all.

I trade options which I believe are underpriced, tend to very quickly take profits (usually in < 2 weeks, despite the fact I'm trading leaps) and roll profits into the underlying. IE: $SNAP. IMO this one is likely to run over 10 after the next ER's (the drop was due to a bug in their advertising platform). I stand by my previous investment + DD.

My trading style involves using leaps / far expiration options for risk mitigation (ie: if my thesis is wrong - I can just keep holding / re-evaluate) & to leverage my bets. This one made me \~16-18% in a week, which is a fantastic return IMO. I got a 20k snap share freeroll out of it - which IMO should pay very well. I don't like following things long term with options, so just hold shares on things I previously followed.

For evidence of risk mitigation - look at my history for how I played GTLB. I bought before ER's and they ate a -12% overnight (while I was long OTM calls). I woke up to a \~25% unrealized loss. I held for 2 weeks and managed to sell for a \~5% profit - as I re-evaluated risk matrix after the drop & decided it was positive EV to continue to hold.

I only follow a few tickers at once & never went broke from taking profits. Rotating my trading capital elsewhere into another (imo) undervalued thing. There's a few on my radar.

Goodluck to all in the cino

Secretary of Defense, Hegseth’s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no brainer. 

The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies. It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports.

""While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,"" Hegseth said in the video online. ""Not anymore.""

The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by ""approving hundreds of American products"" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a ""variety of low-cost drones"" made by American engineers and AI experts.

The order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use.

""Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,"" the memo said.

Lastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars.

""Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,"" Hegseth wrote in the memo.

The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace.

As of their recent Town Hall announcement, RedCat has finally received the green light from the Army to announce LRIP (Low Rate Initial Production) portion of the SRR contract. Announcing 690 systems rather previous 550. Their guidance for fiscal year is 80-120M projected to hit 55M for Q3 this year. Today, they announced their first delivery of 45 systems for a total of $3.5M. We did the numbers and it took them approximately 3.4 days to deliver 45 drones, which indicates they can easily produce, deliver and execute. 

Following news today, RedCat’s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat’s drones. 

They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options

TLDR: Drone warfare is here. American drone dominance is here. Plan to outpace China which means $$$$$ for drone industry. RedCat won SRR contract beating 30+ competitors for it. Meeting the supply demand for the contract. 
Has connections to current administration. Approved for NATO.

Genius Sports (GENI) – Equity Research Report

Rating: Buy | Price Target: $40/share

Company Overview
Genius Sports is a leading provider of official sports data, video, and media technology services. It operates in three segments: Betting Technology & Services, Media Technology & Services, and Sports Technology & Services. Its core business revolves around delivering low-latency, official data feeds, integrity solutions, and media/ad-tech solutions to sportsbooks, leagues, and advertisers.

Industry Structure: The Duopoly
The global sports data industry has consolidated into a duopoly between Genius Sports and Sportradar. Most top-tier leagues have signed official rights contracts with one of these two players.
This grants both companies pricing power, sticky multi-year contracts, and significant barriers to entry. Sportradar's acquisition of IMG Arena and Genius Sports' extended NFL exclusive rights through 2030 reinforce this structure.

Catalyst: December 3, 2025 Investor Day
On December 3, 2025, Genius Sports will host its Investor Day in New York City. The company will demonstrate its product suite, growth strategy, and financial outlook. Investors are expected to gain a clearer understanding of the depth, breadth, and strength of Genius’ rapidly growing Media segment, guided to grow at least 60% YoY in 2H-2025. The Investor Day will likely highlight product demos, fan intelligence capabilities (via the Sports Innovation Lab acquisition), and advertising integrations, which may catalyze investor confidence and support valuation re-rating.

Media Business Growth
Genius’ Media business, driven by FANHub, ad-tech integrations, and fan intelligence tools, is the fastest-growing part of the company. With ~60% YoY growth guided for H2-2025, management aims to establish Media as a core driver of margin expansion. This segment is expected to mature into a higher-margin, software-like business, improving Genius’ overall profitability profile.

Why Genius Sports and Sportradar Are the Visa & Mastercard of Sports Betting
• Two-Sided Networks: They connect leagues (rights owners) with sportsbooks/media operators,similar to how Visa/Mastercard connect merchants and cardholders.
• Mission-Critical Infrastructure: Official live data feeds are indispensable for in-play betting, just as cardrails are essential for commerce.
• Duopoly Resilience: Like Visa and Mastercard, two scaled networks coexist globally, ensuringredundancy and pricing balance.
• Embedded Growth: Both are layering new services (media, AI, video) like Visa/Mastercard layeredfraud prevention, cross-border fees, and loyalty.
• High Switching Costs: Sportsbooks cannot risk losing official feeds, echoing merchants’ dependenceon card networks.
Path to $40/share
GENI trades around $12.79 today. To reach $40 (~$10B equity value), the company must scale revenue from ~$645M in 2025 to ~$1.2–1.3B by 2027–2028, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to 25–30% or more. That would yield ~$350–$400M EBITDA. At a premium 25x EV/EBITDA multiple, supported by duopoly economics and rapid Media growth, GENI’s valuation aligns with $40/share.

Exhibit: GENI Share Price Bridge to $40

Risks
• Rights renewal risk: leagues may demand higher economics or switch providers.
• Ad-market cyclicality could slow Media growth if brand budgets decline.
• Competitive pressure from Sportradar or new entrants in specific markets.
• Regulatory risks affecting betting, advertising, or data usage.
Conclusion
Genius Sports and Sportradar stand as the two strongest business models in the global sports betting industry, analogous to Visa and Mastercard in payments. Both firms benefit from scale, rights exclusivity, and embedded network effects. With rapid Media growth, a clear duopoly, and the upcoming December 2025 Investor Day as a catalyst, we see GENI’s path to $40/share as realistic within 2–3 years. We assign a Buy rating with a $40/share price target.",26,35,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/qa3n1w0nhuqf1.jpeg,new,YOLO,0.82

Postion Before:

**My positions now:**

* **$IREN – $48k** (main conviction play)
* **$CIFR – $13k**
* **$GLXY – $7k**

* These names are perfectly positioned for the **AI + Bitcoin + Datacenter** melt-up.
* If even *one* of them lands a big hyperscaler contract (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, w.e), it’s an instant **2x+**.
* My bet is on **$IREN** leading the pack. They’re scaling fast, and the “AI miner pivot” narrative is just starting.

# The Setup:

1nnr3mg,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 12:24:18,YOLO $600k+ speculation on MUX as Barrick M&A target,"Commodities like gold, silver, and uranium have the sex appeal for investors doing moon math on free cash flow from rising commodity prices. However, looking at the strategic focus of mining majors, they are in love with copper, especially supermassive, cheap copper porphyry deposits up in the Andes in newly liberalized Argentina. Case in point is the recent Teck+Anglo merger, a harbinger of M&A to come in the copper space.

Most of the juicy Andes copper deposits have been taken by the Lundin clan, but MUX has one remaining supermassive copper project in Los Azules. Doing napkin math on Los Azules economics at current copper prices gets a NPV that suggests MUX's Los Azules stake easily exceeds the enterprise value of MUX, not counting McEwen's substantial though mediocre gold mining operations.

I see Barrick as most likely acquirer given their existing operations in the same San Juan province of Argentina, given their nearby Veladero JV with Shandong Gold. Most of their operational/regulatory know-how readily translates out to building Los Azules. In my eye, the Los Azules dream team would be Barrick as operator, and Shandong Gold/Rio Tinto/McEwen Mining as minority equity partners given operational, technological, and exploration expertise on the Los Azules geology. In my calculation, Barrick could plausibly build out Los Azules with fronting just a couple hundred million of project equity with these partners, writing a royalty to FNV/WPM, and taking reasonable levels of project debt.

The other potential operator is Rio Tinto who is already on the Los Azules cap table. While Rio has nearby Argentina operations, they are in the Salta province and their workforce/operational knowledge is less readily translatable to Los Azules.

MUX has a long-awaited technical report on Los Azules coming out next month. It has been delayed a couple times, and my read of the delays is that they are due to scope creep, i.e. positive surprises that necessitate further exploration/testing than originally envisioned. MUX has verbally indicated plans for an IPO of the stake and potentially building out the project themselves, but IMO this is just positioning/angling for stronger hand in M&A negotiations. Either way, once that technical report comes out, I believe the stock can move very quickly.

Wish me luck as I have a degenerately large portfolio fraction on this bet. I plan to hold options into year end and may trade in and out of shares.

**Disclaimer: This is purely my own speculation with no confirmations, my napkin math has been very wrong in the past. I am not an investment professional, this is not investment advice.**

1nnn5y4,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 09:56:08,SkyWater Technology ($SKYT) - Prospective White House/DOD Stake,"**SkyWater Technology ($SKYT) - Prospective White House/DOD Stake:** 

* Skywater (SKYT) is a special company. It’s a US semiconductor manufacturer sitting at the intersection of two secular themes: (1) Domestic, trusted supply of US military chips, and (2) picks and shovels exposure to quantum computing.

**Core defense/specialty foundry (\~80% of revenue)**

* Skywater is one of 12 DMEA category 1-A trusted foundries certified to supply chips to the US DoD. For those of you too lazy to look up what that means, this is basically the Fort Knox of chip fabs, and it’s hard to get. Unlike peers embedded in large conglomerates (BAE, Raytheon, ON), **SKYT is one of the ONLY public pureplays on US military chip fabrication**.

**SKYT has two important facilities:**

* Florida advanced packaging: the DoD awarded SKYT $120mm (with options up to $190mm) to build this out. It is trusted & accredited and almost ready to start ramping. Outputs will be used in **drones, electronic warfare, guided munitions, and space avionics.**
* Austin fab: this was owned by Infineon and SKYT is acquiring it. It was not “trusted” before, but under Skywater, it will be. It previously specialized in industrial/auto end markets, but now will be eligible to supply chips for **drones, satellites, missiles, and comms gear.**

**Quantum & Photonics (\~20% of revenue)**

* Donald mentioned the word “quantum” 5 times in his speech with Starmer last week. The hype cycle is in full swing. And Skywater is the classic picks and shovels play.
* While every PhD with a powerpoint is burning through VC cash\*\*, Skywater is one of the only companies actually getting paid\*\*.  They provide essential foundry services and photonics platforms that quantum players need for their chips and devices. Management has called out double digit y/y growth, and if quantum really takes off, this business could hockey stick.

**Policy Tailwinds & Strategic Importance**

* The CEO, Thomas Sonderman, has been busy in Washington. Just earlier this month he was seen at the White House with top brass, including Michael Kratsios, the Chief Technology Officer of the United States. Kratsios is responsible for crafting the US quantum strategy (photos attached).
   * [Michael J.K Kratsios - Department of War Bio](https://www.war.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/2279091/michael-jk-kratsios/)
* SKYT is already in the club. They’re pre-vetted and pre-funded. Next up could be CHIPs grants, new DoD IDIQs/OTAs, and though a long shot, maybe even a direct government equity check.

**Why Now?**

* “Quantum” is getting publicity at the highest levels. Attention = budgets.
* SKYT’s Florida facility is nearly ready to ramp. This probably means some big DoD orders are on the way. They paid for it after all. 
* At today’s market cap, you’re buying a critical part of the US defense/quantum supply chain at a total bargain. 

**TLDR:** $SKYT is a tiny company with a license to print money from the Pentagon. They are one of the only pureplays building ""Made in the USA"" chips for the military. They are also the picks and shovels play for the quantum computing industry, collecting tolls from whoever wins. Technology. Skywater already has a seat at the table and is Chummy with DOD Pals.

**Position:** Nov/Dec/Jan $20 Call

1nmucye,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 11:05:40,The Federal Reserve’s Dual Mandate Is Outdated And The Data Used For Decisions Are Wrong. A Better Approach From Escorts.,"The Fed claims to balance price stability with maximum employment. In practice, both pillars are built on sand:

Job creation data is constantly revised downward... the latest BLS revision wiped out 911,000 jobs like a bad typo.

The unemployment rate is essentially fan fiction. It counts gig workers, Uber drivers, OnlyFans creators, and yes, technically even escorts, prostitutes, hookers, and strippers as “employed.”

Inflation at “3%” is a joke. My grocery bill, rent, and utilities all disagree.

The truth is, the economy runs on a far more honest set of forces: men’s disposable income to spend on sex work and women’s willingness to sell companionship.

So I propose a new, more accurate Dual Mandate for the Federal Reserve:

1. Balance the number of men who can still afford escorts, prostitutes, hookers, strippers, and sugar babies.

2. Balance the number of women entering sex work out of economic necessity.


Here’s the model:

Bad economy: More women enter the industry due to lack of alternatives while men cut back on spending

Good economy: Fewer women stay in sex work since they have better alternatives; men who can afford it spend more


Forget CPI. The true measure of inflation is the Escort Asking Rate Index (EARI™) a basket of advertised rates across cities. If her hourly goes up, it’s because her rent, groceries, and Uber rides went up. That’s a real-time, boots-on-the-ground measure of cost of living.

So if you want price stability and full employment? Look no further than the front page of Tryst and Seeking instead of opaque & confusing calculations done by economists

As a future Fed official, I’ll ensure every FOMC meeting includes a robust discussion of escort pricing trends before setting interest rates. Powell had his dot plot. I’ll have my thot plot.

1nm0a5q,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 10:54:22,Huge Micron Bet,"Hey everyone,

First time with a DD so forgive me if I sound regarded. 

This is the biggest trade I am set up for and wanted to share my thoughts. 

I believe we are going to see a huge run up next Tuesday with Microns earnings call. Current price is $162 with the pull back with Samsungs announcement spooking the market but I believe this won’t affect Microns future capabilities with HBM.  

So Micron Q4 earnings are coming up… and I’m bullish. I took up a huge position with the underlying prior to the pump on Thursday. 

Yesterday with the drop I loaded up at the bottom on 200 calls $175 expiring October 17. 

My logic is this. 

Seeing what happened with Oracle over their guidance gives me confident we may expect something crazy from Micron, especially when their customers Nvidia, Amd, Microsoft, Amazon, Google all had record years. All of them just crushed it on AI and cloud growth.

If they’re winning, Micron is too. Every GPU and every data center relies on Micron’s memory to run. While there are 2 main competitors in the memory landscape (Samsung and SK Hynix) I believe Micron is well positioned regardless. 

Last quarter: $9.3B in revenue with nearly 50% growth in high-bandwidth memory sales.

Next up: Management is guiding ~$10.7B for Q4 with stronger margins. I think they may beat expectations. 

In all of the last 5 reported fiscal quarters listed above, Micron has beaten EPS expectations.  ￼

The beat amounts range from ~+$0.13 to ~+$0.34 in recent quarters.

The most recent (Q3 FY2025) was the largest beat in that sample, +$0.34

However with this upcoming Q4 FY 2025, EPS consensus estimates are around $2.78-$2.86 per share. Year-over-year that’s a big jump from ~$1.18 in Q4 FY2024.  ￼
	
Gross margin expectations have been revised up, reflecting tight supply + improved pricing (especially DRAM).

Analyst Quotes & Price Targets

Wedbush (Matt Bryson) – PT $200

“Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson raised the firm’s price target on Micron Technology to $200 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm notes that demand from cloud service providers has come in stronger than expected, which could significantly boost Micron’s future sales and pricing power. Wedbush believes that the ongoing AI build-out is creating a structural uplift in demand for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory that will continue through 2026.” 【Barron’s】

Barclays – PT $175

“Barclays analysts raised their Micron target price to $175 from about $140, while maintaining an Overweight rating. The analysts acknowledged that some of the recent NAND chip orders coming out of Silicon Valley may be short-term in nature, but they believe Micron will likely exceed its current guidance. They also expect the company to offer a strong forward outlook as hyperscaler spending on AI infrastructure continues at an aggressive pace.” 【Barron’s】

Deutsche Bank (Melissa Weathers) – PT $175

“Deutsche Bank analyst Melissa Weathers lifted her price target on Micron shares from $155 to $175, reiterating a Buy rating. She noted that favorable market conditions for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory, particularly products tied to artificial intelligence data centers, are a major driver of upside. Weathers added that DRAM pricing has remained firm, supply is constrained, and demand for HBM in GPUs and servers is accelerating faster than the Street had anticipated.” 【Investors.com】

Mizuho (Vijay Rakesh) – PT $182

“Mizuho Securities raised its price target on Micron to $182 and kept a Buy rating. Analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote that momentum around artificial intelligence and strong demand for high-bandwidth memory should continue to drive Micron’s results higher. He cited tight supply in both DRAM and NAND, with pricing moving upward, as well as Micron’s increasing share of AI-focused products. Rakesh emphasized that Micron is one of the few companies positioned to deliver both volume growth and margin expansion in this environment.” 【MarketWatch】

UBS (Timothy Arcuri) – PT $185

“UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised Micron’s price target to $185 and reiterated a Buy rating. Arcuri pointed to confidence in DRAM and HBM supply tightness and sustained AI-related growth as the core reasons for the higher target. He noted that Micron’s technology roadmap has been executing well and that the company is positioned to capture outsized share of the high-performance memory demand wave driven by Nvidia, AMD, and hyperscalers.” 【PriceTargets.com】

Susquehanna – PT $200

“Susquehanna Financial upgraded its Micron target to $200, keeping a Positive rating. Analysts cited tightening DRAM and NAND supply, improving average selling prices across memory, and accelerating AI adoption as reasons to expect Micron’s earnings power to surprise to the upside. The firm believes current Street estimates remain too low given the structural tailwinds in AI-centric workloads.” 【PriceTargets.com】

JPMorgan (Harlan Sur) – PT $185

“JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised Micron’s price target to $185 from $160 and kept an Overweight rating. Sur highlighted upside to revenue, gross margin, and earnings in the near term, driven by better-than-expected pricing across multiple end-markets including AI data centers, smartphones, and personal computers. He said the company is likely to announce November-quarter guidance that comes in solidly ahead of consensus expectations. JPMorgan believes Micron’s HBM3E ramp and DRAM cost reductions are ahead of schedule, which will further support earnings acceleration.” 【Benzinga】

Rosenblatt Securities (Kevin Cassidy) – PT $200

“Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy reaffirmed a Buy rating on Micron and boosted the firm’s target to $200. Cassidy wrote that Micron could report a modest beat to its preannounced results, but the real story will be the outlook. He expects Micron’s November-quarter guidance may come in much higher than consensus estimates of $11.8 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.00. Cassidy emphasized that constrained DRAM and NAND Flash wafer supply through at least 2026, alongside accelerating demand from AI workloads, positions Micron for outsized profitability.” 【Benzinga】

Zacks Investment Research – Avg PT $155.59 (Range $75–$200)

“Zacks recently upgraded Micron from Hold to Strong Buy, giving the stock a Zacks Rank #1. Their analysts cite accelerating demand for DRAM and NAND, stronger-than-expected revenue in AI/data center markets, and consistent earnings surprises as the drivers. Zacks’ consensus 12-month price target from ~34 analysts is $155.59, with estimates ranging from as low as $75 to as high as $200. They highlight Micron’s strong Growth and Momentum scores, though its Value score is weaker given the higher multiples.” 【Zacks / MarketBeat】

Micron Management Quotes & Context

“Micron’s strong competitive position and solid execution delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, with revenue, gross margin and EPS all exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges.” — Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO.  ￼

“Data center revenue more than doubled year over year and reached a record level, and consumer-oriented markets had strong sequential growth.” — Mehrotra.  ￼
	
“We generated substantial free cash flow in the quarter, even as we continue to make strategic investments critical to sustain long term growth.” — Mehrotra.  ￼
	
“Micron delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, driven by all-time-high DRAM revenue including nearly 50% sequential growth in HBM revenue.” — Mehrotra.  ￼

“We are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025, while we invest to build on our leadership to address growing AI-driven memory demand.” — Mehrotra.  ￼

“Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $7.1 billion, up 51% year over year, and represented 76% of total revenue. Sequentially, DRAM revenue increased 15%, with bit shipments increasing over 20% and prices decreasing in the low single-digit percentage range, primarily due to a higher consumer-oriented revenue mix.” — Mark Murphy, CFO.  ￼

“NAND revenue was $2.2 billion … Sequentially, NAND revenue increased 16%, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-20s percentage range and prices decreasing in the high single-digit percentage range.” — Murphy.  ￼

“Gross margin … was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better prices for both DRAM and NAND, partially offset by a higher consumer-oriented mix.” — CFO Murphy.  ￼
	
“Ending inventory for fiscal Q3 was $8.7 billion, or 139 days. Inventory was down $280 million sequentially, and inventory days were down 19 days sequentially, driven by strong sequential bit shipment growth in both DRAM and NAND.” — Murphy.  ￼
	
Guidance for Q4:
“We expect revenue of $10.7 billion ± $300 million; gross margin non-GAAP of ~42% ± 1%; operating expenses approx $1.2 billion ± $20 million; non-GAAP EPS of ~$2.50 ± $0.15 per share.” — Micron management.  ￼

“With another quarter of shipment growth forecasted in fiscal Q4, we expect to exit fiscal 2025 with tight DRAM inventories, significantly reduced NAND inventories and overall company DIO near our target levels. With low inventories on hand and a constructive demand environment, we will continue to focus on improving pricing and further strengthening our product mix.” — Management.  ￼

TLDR

Best Case (Bullish)

Revenue: ~$11.2B+ (above top of guidance)

EPS: $2.90+ (beats revised $2.85 guide)

Gross Margin: 45%+ (tight supply + strong DRAM/HBM pricing)

Guidance: Raised again for FY2026, pointing to sustained AI/cloud demand
	
Stock Impact: Could rally +20–30%, pushing toward $180–$200 as analysts hike targets

Worst Case (Bearish)

Revenue: < $11.0B (below guide midpoint)

EPS: < $2.70 (miss vs Street ~$2.78–$2.85)

Margins: Slip toward 42–43% (pricing softness, higher costs)

Guidance: Conservative, signaling slower demand or inventory concerns

Stock Impact: Could drop −10–25%, retracing toward $120–$130

The biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up, I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular. 

Right now PE is ~24-25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit $10-12 for FY 2026, and PE drops to 18-20 we are still looking at $200+ price target. I believe $175-185 is a lower range.

Of course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise. 

Good luck 🙏",230,169,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nm0a5q,new,DD,0.96

>EDIT:   
  
  
After Paramount CEO David Ellison's ""presumptive all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery,"" Puck's Dylan Byers has followed up to reveal that ""a well-placed Hollywood source called to suggest \[...\] that Netflix was also considering a bid for David Zaslav's \[WBD CEO and president\] assets.""

>Byers acknowledges that this scenario was once ""implausible,"" but that ""Ellison's seemingly limitless cash and ambition have accelerated Hollywood's consolidation process, and his decision to bid for all of WBD now—in an attempt to preempt potential rivals—is forcing nearly everyone to dust off their models.""

>These potential bids are coming after Warner Bros.' historic summer with a streak of successful movies at the box office. However, Puck reports that Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo ""does not expect WBD stock price to move much beyond $19 a share"" and that ""neither Apple nor Amazon will go for all of WBD.""

>Thinking along the lines that Netflix would be interested only in Warner Bros.' studio and streaming operations, Byers says: ""\[...\] as I discussed on Sunday, Zaz would need to convince his board and WBD shareholders that there would be more value coming from the split than from the Ellisons—that two in the bush is worth more than a bird in hand.""

>As far as what Paramount's possibly buying Warner Bros. means, the merging of two of Hollywood's oldest studios could result in a powerful new institution in the industry. Ellison seemingly wants to go all in on this idea, as his goal is to buy all of Warner Bros.' assets, including games, comics, and more. Netflix's offer might mean splitting up parts of the company.

TL:DR - they probably want to spin-off parts of WBD which may be a tougher sell to their shareholders than a huge bag of $ from the Ellisons for the whole thing.

Seems like Netflix is trying to take a final stab at grabbing part of WBD before they sell to PSKY. Ellisons offered $22-24/share, think some analysts were calling 21/share bullish so my take away is that the Ellisons seem likely to get this done.",295,96,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nlw4qk/netflix_to_bid_on_wbd/,new,News,0.9

1nl8km0,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 12:39:52,Duolingo DD," Dear, Ladies, gentleman and degenerate market regards

I’ve been doing a deep dive into one particular public company called Duolingo. You might be saying “wtf the language learning app?”. Yes correct, that app with the green owl. A company can be selling dog food for all I care, but if the numbers and the narrative are good, I'm buying. That being said, Duolingo ($DUOL) is slowly presenting an amazing opportunity as the stock price continues to fall. Opportunities like this is how life changing wealth is made. When everyone is betting on the downfall, you take the other side of that trade and bet against them all. The risk to reward ratio on this is too good to ignore.

Would also like to mention, if you’re an ape who has been buying into the hype of palantir with a disgusting 600 PE ratio, so high that you might as well buy your local pizza shop thats makes 100k a year for 50 million, then duolingo should not be a problem for you to take a chance on.

**The Narrative**

The bubble has officially popped on Duolingo due to rising fears of competitors entering the market. The two main competitors as of right now are OPENAI, and the tech giant GOOGLE. People are discovering through OpenAi that you can create your own language learning game and are rumoring that people will no longer need duolingo. Google had also announced that they will be entering the language learning app space with google translator utilizing ai for live language conversion. Duolingo did also damage their PR by announcing they would be utilizing AI as well, which the public did not take lightly as they misunderstood it for replacing their employees with AI. Users also had reason to believe that AI will create poor quality content in comparison to having humans manually make the courses which may be true; however, if other companies are in the race utilizing AI for language learning, then Duolingo must compete. Those 3 narratives were enough to pop the bubble of duolingo as it has fallen from $542 to $282 as of today. Can the stock fall further? Yes it can, but it's one of those scenarios where you want it to.

The P/E ratio of Duolingo was over 300 at its peak on May 15th 2025. Yes the company was way overvalued at the time for a growth company, (a fair valuation for growth companies range between (40-80) however the company is consistently beating earnings expectations and their free cash flow continues to rise higher and higher. Today that P/E ratio has dropped to 122 and its price to sales ratio has dropped to 15:1. Yes those numbers still do seem high, but 

as their free cash flow continues to rise, that P/E ratio will drop into fair valuations. Understand that this company is growing on average 40% year over year. For those who don't understand, markets are always forward looking. The institutions and retail investors who are buying into this company are betting on the fact that the over valuation numbers will drop as they consistently report good earnings, revenue and forward guidance.

**The Bull Thesis**

So before being able to predict the future, you first need to look into the past where history doesn't always repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. Take a look at the success of Netflix. Even when Amazon, Apple, Disney and Google (youtube) entered the space of video streaming, people thought Netflix would be in serious trouble. In 2011, Amazon announced that they would offer Amazon prime video for free with their subscription; while at the same time Netflix decided to increase their prices by 60%. 

Customers were furious and Netflix lost over 800 000 subscribers in 1 quarter. This resulted in their Free cash flow dropping from 59 million in quarter 2 of 2011, to 15 million in quarter 3 of 2011. Eventually their free cash flow did fall into the negatives and recovered in 2013 (you can see how the stock follows that on the charts).

**The Moat**

There is no moat. Just branding. “How is this bullish?” Well lets think, what’s Spotify's moat? What about Netflix? Literally just branding is the moat, so people who think duolingo’s demise is due to a lack of a business moat are delusional. It’s like saying in the year 2000, “why would anyone buy into amazon when anyone can make a website and sell books?” fucking regards. 

**User Experience**

When you look at music streaming services, spotify ($SPOT) was the first to the game publicly. Eventually, Apple, Google (youtube), Amazon and about 20 other music streaming platforms nobody gives a fuck about had entered the game. Yet to this day, spotify is what’s most popular among them all taking 36% of the music streaming market. Why? User experience is the answer. The spotify platform itself is what carries them and separates them from the rest for both artists and customers. 

**The Brand**

The infamous green owl logo is famous across the world. Duolingo is a world wide icon for language learning. When people hear that “ding\* sound completing a duolingo game, everyone knows instantly that it's duolingo. When people ask about learning another language, they instantly point people in the direction of duolingo. It's literally the rank #13 app on the app store for apple and on the front page of “essential apps.”

	When people talk to each other about music they ask “what's you’re spotify?” Nobody asks whats your “apple music, amazon music or youtube music”

	When your wife’s boyfriend is asking her to come over and watch a movie, he says “netflix and chill” NOT “amazon prime, disney, or apple tv and chill?” the fuck?

I'm listing these examples, because they all have a subscription business model just like duolingo. That being said, duolingo’s subscription model is actually better than theirs.

**Business Model**

Ad revenue and subscriptions, that's it. People pay a yearly subscription for their ability to learn new languages which has been proven to be more effective and enjoyable than any other method through gamification. You got kids who are using this damn app in school, recommended by their teachers and you have parents buying it for their kids. Lets not forget that this company is now going to expand out of just language learning as they have included learning subjects like music, math and chess. 

Wait? Chess? Wtf? 

Yes that's exactly what I'm thinking, but if you look beyond that, Duolingo is expanding to hit the whole education market. Why pay for chess lessons from elsewhere when you can get it on duolingo with 100+ additional learning courses. Ideally, duolingo is expanding into a whole education platform, more directed towards the youth for everything. I wouldn't be surprised if they included courses like science, finance, health etc…

	They have utilized AI in addition to help the teachers/course makers create new courses at a very accelerated pace. Their first 100 courses took them 12 years. Now with AI, they are generating 153 new courses in 1 year.

	There is NO FRICTION.

* No governments/regulations trying to stop this
* No maintenance on their assets (courses)
* No real competition in user experience

All they have to do is create a great product (a course), add it into their catalog of other courses that comes with the subscription. The more they add, the more incentive there is to go with duolingo instead of buying learning programs elsewhere.

**The Bear Thesis**

Go fuck yourself?

On a serious note, looking at Google live translation app which they offer for free; it does seem to be very reliable, but strictly for translating. They claim to be offering language learning practice tools on their google translate app which would be free. Not to mention, there are already over 1 billion downloads of google translate. Comparing it to Duolingo, yes both of them are free, however; google has not announced whether they would  put a pay wall behind learning/using their practice tool. However what google is missing in comparison to Duolingo secret formula of success would be gamification. 

If the companies continues to show slower growth, or continues to show a decline in active user for the few quarters; well then, we’re fucked. But as of right now, the decline in free cash flow from last quarter to this isn’t ""catastrophic,"" but rather a typical overreaction to the narrative. 

**External Risks**

Rising interest rates. Lets be real, trump is calling for lower interest rates but obviously Jerome Powell doesn't want to follow through with it. In the long term event that they can’t afford to lower rates but rather might  increase rates; the broad market does face the risk of a downturn just like in 2022-2023, which of course would most likely add more downward pressure to the stock and market as a whole.

Another external risk that may present itself is a massive bull market in gold, and extreme volatility in government bond markets, more specifically the 10 year yield bonds. For those who don't understand, a massive bull market in gold has always signaled warning signs that something is about to break in the financial system, because gold has always been considered the safe haven asset. Extreme volatility in bond markets signal panic when the yields spread too far apart from the benchmark rate of the federal reserve, which stands at 4.25 as of right now.

Free cash flow = cash from operations - capital expenditures.

Notice how their free cash flow keeps on rising? Notice how free cash flow has dropped in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025? That small decline in free cash flow, paired with the narrative of the company's demise in the future has resulted in a crash from $542 to $282. Let me tell you right now, if this company reports an increase in free cash flow in the next few earnings calls; Not only can the narrative change from negative to positive, this stock can very well turn around and go bullish very fast.

|Free cash flow margin|30.1%|34.2%|\~4 pts|

The stock price of Duolingo hovering at $270 is basically assuming the company’s growth over the next 5 years would only be at about 25%. If you take a look at the numbers above, the only thing that's under 25% are the monthly active users. The Company is projecting on its forward guidance about 35% YoY growth; which means the stock price is falling towards undervalued territory. The company has been growing at about 45% annually over the past 5 years, so yes a 35% growth on forward guidance does signal a decline in growth. But if you want to take the contrarian approach to the company, believing that AI will accelerate the growth of the company and Google means fuck all; this would be an amazing buying opportunity. 

P.S -This is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor. This is just my opinion on my projections of this company's stock price. If you buy high, panic, then sell low, too bad, sucks for you. Would recommend buying and holding the stock as we don't know how long this negative narrative will play out. (maybe **WRITING** covered calls OTM for a passive income) If you're a regard and you choose to gamble your life savings **Buying** OTM call options, good luck.

The DOE argues that current project development is moving too slowly to meet the demands of reindustrialization and the growing manufacturing base, as well as the surging load from artificial intelligence and data centers. By working with stakeholders, the department aims to identify projects that can deliver power reliably while addressing the challenges of today’s grid.*

*Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will need much more energy in the years ahead and emphasized that, under President Trump’s leadership, the DOE intends to ensure this demand can be met with affordable, reliable, and secure energy. The Speed to Power initiative is designed to harness private-sector expertise and expand the use of all viable energy sources so the United States can remain competitive in the global AI race.*

*The first step is a request for information to collect input on large-scale projects, including both generation and transmission. The program builds on Trump’s first-day executive order declaring a National Energy Emergency, which called for an urgent expansion of energy infrastructure to strengthen both national and economic security.*

*In connection with that order, the DOE released a report on grid reliability and security that sets a standard methodology to identify regions most at risk and guide interventions. The report warns that if firm, reliable sources are not added as older capacity retires, blackouts could rise one hundredfold by 2030.*

*The Speed to Power initiative is aligned with the administration’s executive orders on unleashing U.S. energy and boosting American leadership in AI, directing federal resources toward removing barriers and ensuring grid infrastructure keeps pace with demand. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are viewed as an important part of this broader effort, offering new firm nuclear capacity that can be deployed more quickly and flexibly than traditional large-scale plants, helping to reinforce reliability while meeting growing power needs.*",251,151,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-doe-launches-speed-power-110343255.html,new,News,0.95
1nl4g6m,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 10:03:11,$TTD DD: The Tendie Desk,"If you’ve seen my last couple posts I’ve been pretty good at picking stocks near the bottom before a bull run. CRDO, NBIS, ENTG, GLXY and most recently MNDY which I did a DD on. The problem is I’m a regard and mismanaged all of them for a loss except MNDY, but I’m rolling those gains into what I present before you today: $TTD. 

TTD is an ad tech company that has received a series of aggressive prison beatings in the market on its way to becoming S&P 500’s worst performing stock of 2025. They act as the Don Draper of advertising, so if you’re a company that wants to advertise on platforms outside of the walled gardens you don’t call each company individually you call TTD and they help you find the best spots for your money across the channels they have access to. Most of TTD’s slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn’t have access to youtube, prime video and ig.

[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)

They aren’t taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying “we’re undervalued” or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don’t care either way because I think they’ll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. 

The DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said “TTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market”. Well I’m putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green’s imaginings. 

[Got flamed last time for posting after my position was already up so this is hot off the press.](https://preview.redd.it/m6lu0fd3o4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d54a33d6a6fbefca78b474a478c3e828bb6b776)

Final considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix. 

Also incredibly small flyer chance TikTok’s walled garden is opened up in the US acquisition giving TTD further opportunity.",105,65,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nl4g6m/ttd_dd_the_tendie_desk/,new,DD,0.95

1nkow7c,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 20:19:37,[GAP]PING UP,"Alright, listen up you degenerates - while everyone is fomo-ing over AI, Semiconductors, Opendoor & New/Old-age tech memes - there's some real $$ to be made on some lesser focused, social arbitrage, value plays that have real potential to make 20, 30, 40%+ moves. I don't know where the rest of them are, but I'm talking about $GAP. This is a weird one but hear me out and look at my dd and let me know if I'm regarded.  
  
So why **$GAP?** I first thought about $GAP after $AEO's most recent earnings, where they shot up 40%+ after hours on results. This got me interested because the headlines for the earnings move were ""Sydney Sweeney"" related and the controversy her campaign generated, which translated into billions of impressions and many new customers. For anyone not on social media, $GAP capitalized on $AEO's controversy with their own denim ad in collaboration with KATSEYE - a global girl group which had recently been gaining insane traction with their own Netflix show, performances, and viral songs (Gnarly, Gabriela, etc.). The $GAP Denim ad went mega-viral across all social media and spawned videos everywhere of everyone replicating the dance in Denim - free advertising for $GAP. At this point, it's just an idea - so let's do some digging:  
  
**WHY DID AEO SURGE AFTER EARNINGS?**

To better understand the potential value $GAP - I wanted to better understand what made $AEO move so much after earnings. Here's what I found:

* Better than expected earnings, EPS $0.45 v $0.20 – 125% surprise beat and 15% YoY increase. They were beaten down after pulling their initial guidance, causing major uncertainty amongst investors.

* Revenue at $1.28B – beat expectations by 4.07%. Revenue was flat compared to prior year but still beat expectations and profitability surprise drove the run-up.

* Share buyback program YTD has reduced outstanding diluted shares by 10%, which contributed to increased EPS.

* Successful Marketing campaign wins in collaboration with Sydney Sweeney & Travis Kelce. According to the earnings call – 40 billion impressions, 700k new customer count, selling out of Sydney’s labeled AE products.

* Cost control which contributed to surprise EPS beat – SG&A down from last year & lower promotional activity.

* Optimistic commentary from management – they noted that they saw “nice upticks” in the AE business in Q3 – signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook – coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline). The revenues remained flat this quarter, which was surprising from how they talked about the success of their campaign, but this was explained by some of their core products being laggers (shorts). The lag was offset by the influx of new customers via the Sydney Sweeney ads.

* They noted that they saw “nice upticks” in the AE business in Q3 – signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook – coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline) 

They were also at a depressed valuation, especially after their poor Q1 Results, with P/E hovering between 9x-11x months after their Q1 earnings and before Q2 earnings. Understandable as the CEO also pulled their guidance for the year, which was a big red flag.

They are now trading at a TTM P/E of 18, and forward earnings above 14+ (I keep getting different estimate numbers, but it seems estimates are being repriced). A bit high in my opinion for a retail brand that hasn't shown stable, consistent growth - *but also not entirely unreasonable* \- and they are coming in with a more positive outlook. The markets are hungry for equities and multiples on average are higher.

They did also have relatively high short interest at \~18% before earnings, which likely also contributed to the sustained price movement upwards with shorts covering their positions. The last short interest data I looked at was on Fintel from 8/29/25 - right before their earnings. Once 9/15/25 data comes out, could validate this assumption.

Overall, the huge run-up doesn't seem to be completely ridiculous. The stock was at depressed valuations with a lot of negativity priced in. Earnings came at a huge beat, hugely successful ad campaign, and upbeat outlook from management. The price is now at an elevated multiple (maybe a little higher than it deserves, but only time will tell), but is not out of the normal for where AEO has traded historically and is not absolutely farfetched (look below:)

**NOW THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY AEO MOVED THE WAY IT DID, WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT GAP?**  
  
First - I looked more into $GAP as a business. They’re much larger than AEO, generating nearly 3-4x their revenues. They also have a larger reach globally – operating in 40 + countries. They also include multiple brands under their umbrella – GAP, Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta. The big driver for GAP is their attempt to reinvigorate their brand, which has been showing slightly positive results in 3/4 brands over the past few quarters.  
  
I wouldn’t say their plan has yielded anything overly positive - UNTIL their most recent KATSEYE ad. For those of you that are unaware, it has gone insanely viral – similarly to the Sydney Sweeney ad, which is when I began looking into the stock for a potential beat / revised outlook on the brand. GAP collaborated with KATSEYE, which is a multicultural POP girl group that has been growing significantly in popularity with the younger demographic.

Their collab has already reached over 100M views on tiktok – just the main video alone (when I first checked, it was at 90M - then 2 days later, it was over 100M). People have been remaking, stitching, re-uploading the ad and those videos have also hit many millions of views (some individual video remakes have hit 40M+ views themselves, and I’m sure I probably haven’t seen all of them). IG has over 60M views ,Youtube has over 20M+ views, the shorts video has 5M+ views.

If we compare that to $AEO's Sweeny campaign, GAP has vastly outperformed in viewership (and probably engagement) across all platforms. $AEO also did pull the main ad off their social media and the supporting ads are also in the multi-millions of views, but they still don't compare to what $GAP has done in a shorter period of time.

\***Note: I did this research last week so the numbers may have shifted higher. Just checking tiktok & IG alone - the main video alone is now at 133M views on TT and \~70M views on IG.**

GAP's vids on tiktok previously were only hitting anywhere between 10-100k views. I think the more recent ones that were towards the top left gained traction as they were closer to the actual ad debut - being brought up by the launch of the ad itself. When a video goes mega viral on a page, it typically lifts the views of the other videos as well.

There are also endless video remakes tagging $GAP & Katseye hitting insane numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/jogcin72l0qf1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2504e259f6010f5ea29b1ba1dea4d7cad3572cc6

The ad became the most searched query on tiktok and was also mentioned on GAP’s earnings in late August. The CEO stated they reached over 8 billion impressions, which I believe was probably **understated** as it was likely gathered before the actual date of the earnings for the CEO's interview on Mad Money.

***NOTE - earnings came out 9 days after the ad was released and the Q2 earnings were reporting figures from August 2nd, 2025 - before the ad was released.***

**GAP HAD AN AMAZING AD, WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GAP'S UPCOMING NUMBERS?**

If we look at total sales as of FY 2024, GAP was about 22% of their sales (3.3b/15.1b). I couldn’t find the sales mix numbers on how much Denim they sell annually, but according to ChatGPT – the expectation is that they sell between 10-20% of their revenues in Jeans. At a midpoint, we can extrapolate that GAP sells approximately $400-$500M annually in denim – which I think is reasonable assumption.

Retail typically does not perfectly sell through all of their items, and GAP is not to be excluded from this observation. They'll likely have much more denim to sell beyond what they typically do, and in preparation for a large ad campaign - retailers often adjust inventory for this.

Since it's not easy to find concrete figures online about sales mix - let's use $AEO's earnings as an example to potentially gauge the impact the Katseye ad will have on $GAP. Quote from the earnings transcript ***""Sweeny Signature jeans sold out within a week and some products within 1 day. Demand for her curated online shop of Syd's Picks has been very strong.""***

Prior to their Q2 Earnings - Zacks' consensus estimate for AEO's earnings was $1.23b (about a 5-6% decline from the prior year), while their actual revenue was $1.28b (representing a \~1% decline YoY). This was a beat on revenue expectations of \~$50M. The decline expectations seemed in line with their Q1 report, which was quite depressing. The CEO spoke of all the new customers / eyeballs they got, how they plan on retaining and converting more of these new customers, and had an upbeat outlook going into the second half of the year.

So how can we think about this with GAP? The Ads are clearly different, but I believe GAP's strategic timing and content leveraged the controversy AEO created to boost their own campaign - **and it worked amazingly**. Aside from the screenshots shown above, IG has over 60M views, YouTube has over 20M views, and 5M views on YouTube Shorts - all platforms the Katseye GAP campaign has garnered more views & engagement while being up for a shorter duration of time.

According to GAP’s earnings call, their outlook is to grow Q3 at 1.5-2.5%. At 2%, this would mean an increase in sales of \~$72 million from Q3 2024. GAP had been teetering between decline and flat revenues in the past few years but has seen slight improvements in revenue growth due to their “reinvigoration” efforts **BEFORE the KATSEYE ad** brought on an insane number of impressions to their business.  
  
Now after the Ad, it's blown any of their campaigns thus far out of the water - with reception from the Ad being overwhelmingly positive and garnered even more support as it’s been touted as “the right way” to do an Ad in comparison to AEO’s campaign. The ad itself is just much easier to talk about and spread in younger circles - what kids / young adults are going to be talking about Sydney's AE monologue over the dance and catchy song from GAP?

I believe their outlook (1.5-2.5% Q3 revenue growth) **does not meaningfully include the impact from the campaign becoming mega viral** as GAP had already been growing at similar rates in other quarters (2% increase YoY last Q3 and beat expectations by 2.5%, and similar to the past few quarters). This makes sense to me as well since the campaign launched only a week before the Earnings call.

From glancing at their website and using LLMs – their denim products seem to average near $60 (they run sales / promotions often). Assume they sell $450M annually at an average $60 price point per item - that’s about 625,000 pieces of denim they sell monthly on a regular basis.  
  
Knowing they typically have excess inventory and that this was a large campaign, let's assume a similar number of new customers come to GAP as AEO (personally, I think GAP's campaign will probably be more effective, but won't know 'til Q3). On 700,000 new customers, I think it's a conservative guess to say a million additional items will be sold (about 1.4\~items per new customer), which would translate to about $60M in additional revenue. That alone would be about an additional 1% of revenue. If we assume less conservatively, we could see an additional 1.5-3% beat on top line revenue on their Q3 estimates.

Here are a few reasons why I think they may sell more than a million additional pieces:

* A segment of shoppers that will have purchased additional items outside of the KATSEYE specific products just from browsing the page / walking through the store and seeing other things they may like.

* Shoppers that bought multiple pieces / whole outfit sets – we can see this just scrolling through something like Tiktok.

* The KATSEYE ad being on trend with younger consumers (catchy song, lyrics that are directly comparing themselves to AE and using it to their favor, easy to learn dance) and women/girls – who are the primary target demographic, and this influencing them towards a brand. Even sororities are using it for rush videos, doing the dance in Denim, gaining tens of millions of views, and tagging GAP.

* The videos seemingly performing better in a shorter time frame. In the past 2 days I’ve checked (These are not the latest numbers, I checked a few days ago, they are likely higher now): \*\***NOTE - this is from last week and checking today on 9/18 on just TT & IG quickly, the views have continued to ramp up**

   * Tiktok’s original GAP ad has already gained +10M views, reaching over 100M views now. AE’s main ad was pulled from their pages, but the remaining ads have around 2-8M views. GAP has supporting ads that have outperformed AE’s best ads.

   * Instagram’s original GAP ad gained +5M views, with over 60M views now. AE’s main ad was pulled, and the top residual ad has 12M views.

   * Youtube’s Video is at 20M views, shorts at 5M views. AE’s remaining ad has 8.8M views and 2.4M views on shorts.

* Q3-Q4 is historically stronger for GAP and retail overall

I also went on GAP and clicked into some of their Denim items and put in a Manhattan (10002) / California Zip code (90001), which gave me 40 GAP locations each, both areas were **out of stock for the products in store.** Earlier in the week, the shipping was **also out of stock**, but it seems it is once again available. I tried clicking multiple sizes, colors, and fit combinations – and they all showed up as sold out in store. A lot of them were still not available online, though it does look like they restocked a bit. I also checked other zip codes like 73301 (Texas) and 60007 (Chicago). I did not have the patience to check all the products / zip codes in the world, but I saw enough that convinced me they are likely selling through the KATSEYE collab items. The first ones I found that were in stock was a “Crop Tank Top”, which you’d have to scroll down to find – but seems like the denim items have been majorly successful.

With a potential revenue beat, and similar renewed optimistic outlook off the back of a wildly successful ad campaign that's even being studied in college marketing classes - it's a recipe for a nice turnaround retail story - the one GAP's been trying to tell for the past few quarters.

**GAP'S VALUATION & PRICE TARGET**

Like AEO before the Sweeney pump - GAP is trading under a 10 P/E and forward earnings of under \~11.5. This gives them **room to move** from both an EPS beat, and a multiple re-rating (similar to what we saw with AEO).

GAP has consistently beat EPS (past 10 or so quarters), meaning management has been diligent about costs / been much more conservative in their guidance.

Based on the current TTM earnings (2.34), a 12x P/E ratio would bring GAP stock up to \~$28. Average analysts forward estimates (\~2.07), a 12x P/E ratio would bring it to $24.84.  
  
Now this is not much upside on the stock, but as we have seen before - GAP has been consistently **beat** earnings expectations and being roughly on target with revenue expectations. **With the ad campaign, I'm expecting a revenue beat, which should help with an earnings beat** **(which I would have expected regardless of the ad campaign as stated above), meaning the $24.84 price target is unlikely and is not my target for the stock.**  
  
Then, if we consider that the stock may rerate based on a more positive outlook and that the P/E is already very low - we could very reasonably see a 13-15x P/E.

* At a 2.34 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $30.42 and 15x P/E would be $35.1

* At a 2.07 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $26.91 and 15x P/E would be $31.05

* Assume the forward earnings estimate beat by 5% (conservative beat) - that's a 2.17 EPS, a 13x P/E is **$28.21** and 15x P/E would be **$32.55**

I'm not delusional - I understand that this is a retail company that's been stagnant over the years - but stocks move when the future of a company looks better than expected. The valuation is low, expectations aren't out of the world, & a decent amount of shares short which may have to cover - which is great for a potential beat and subsequent stock price move.

**If sales and overall outlook improve off the KATSEYE campaign and they continue to beat EPS estimates like they have (boosted by an increase in sales) I would say a $28 price target is realistically achievable and good odds landing somewhere between $30-32.**

*TLDR:*

*- $GAP is trading at low valuations with low expectations and decent short interest, leaving less room for downside and more room for upside.*

*- They have an insanely successful ad campaign running currently for Q3, which has arguably outperformed $AEO's campaign. $AEO's campaign contributed to the stock moving 40% after earnings and had a similar valuation / expectation as $GAP now.*

My current position - may add more leaps:

* They’ve missed a pile of SEC filings (Q3 2024, FY 2024 10-K, Q1 and Q2 2025). Despite this, NYSE is letting them keep trading.
* Lenders (Truist Bank and Omega) agreed to forbearance instead of forcing default. That usually means lenders think there’s value to preserve. Default was from technicality (PACS triggered “technical defaults” because of problems tied to its warrants and its compliance certificates to lenders, the warrant certificates provided to lenders were deemed “defective” or “incorrect"" most likely due to the audit progress), not because they are out of money or something.
* Stock is trading around $12 while analyst price targets are $30+. If filings get cleared, re-rate potential is big.
* Upside play is a recovery to $20–30 if they get current on filings. Minimum. **ATH was $43 in Q3 2024** before the Hindenburg short report which has not been proven right to this day. Was easily on track for $50/share+ by end of 2024, after IPO in April for $21 a share.
* Additionally, **the NYSE has also been repeatedly granting them extensions**, up until the final, November 19th 2025 deadline. This is **bullish** because the exchange would've frozen/kicked them out long ago if they were not showing reasonable progress on filing the delinquent filings.
* From their CEO in their latest investor relations release: *Based on our progress, when we become current in our SEC filings, we expect to report record revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of 2025. We look forward to the Audit Committee completing its investigation as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities ahead to accelerate growth and drive value creation for all stakeholders.”*

**What this boomer factory actually does**

PACS is a holding company investing in post-acute healthcare. Operations are decentralized: independent subsidiaries run the facilities day-to-day; corporate allocates capital, growth, and ops support. Current footprint: \~315 post-acute facilities across 17 states serving nearly 30k patients daily. The demand driver is demographics and acuity, not vibes.

Stock has been hammered and down since November 2024 where they were accused of fraud by a Hindenburg short report. Allegations have not been proven true to this day thus far. Company has been working with their independent auditors and possibly the government behind-the-scenes since then.

**NEW, latest updates in the past week with actual information:**

* Final NYSE extension granted for all delinquent filings, due November 19th 2025.
* Chief Financial Officer resigned (due to an investigation where he accepted high-value items from business partners), interim Chief Financial Officer appointed, Mark H. who is a co-founder and was previously the Chief Financial Officer from 2013 to Jan 1st. 2024.

It's becoming increasingly clear that they intend to file and they have been operating their business successfully during this long independent audit journey, along with implementing new safeguards and processes so that there are no issues going forward.

The company priced its shares to raise about $908 million, reflecting strong investor appetite for cloud security as enterprises continue shifting workloads away from traditional data centers.

Founded in 2012, Netskope built its reputation in cloud security, secure access service edge (SASE), and zero trust, markets forecasted to grow rapidly as businesses adapt to hybrid work and remote-first models. The IPO positions Netskope among top public cybersecurity players like Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks.

The public debut is seen as both a validation of Netskope’s technology and a broader signal that investor confidence in cybersecurity remains strong despite volatility in tech IPO markets. Analysts note that Netskope will now face the challenge of balancing rapid growth with public market scrutiny.

1nkf4y4,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 13:47:16,$SNAP - Quick update. Rolled half my $7c -> $10c,"NFA, DYOR.

\---

I bought 1k leaps yesterday, upped to 3k after high level interactions with chat, and today rolled half my 7c's into 10c's. This one is incredibly undervalued imo. Some rough numbers

\---

\- 480,000,000 daily active users & \~932,000,000 monthly active users

\- 7% growth in MAU since last year

\- **over 5 billion Snaps are created every day** as of late 2024. IE: the average DAU sends off more than 10 snaps every day.

\- Many users have streaks exceeding 1000 days, users are sticky

\- The target audience is mostly teenagers. As per GPT: ""The platform is particularly popular with younger demographics, reaching about 90% of 13- to 24-year-olds""

\- Still super relevant, mostly seemed ignored / not on anyones radar (literally 5% of people on earth use it daily tho). I suspect this is because the primary users are the younger demographic -- ie: most people 30+ I know are not using it.

\- Valued \~$20 - 30 / daily active user.

\- With a streak of 1000+ days, if each \*DAILY\* user is worth 2c / day, it's undervalued on that alone. That's like a single ad. As per above each daily user sends on average 10 snaps a day. I'm sure they can figure out a way to make more than 2c from this. You can probably get \~2 targeted ads be per person per day, assuming 10 snaps. I think it's gotta be worth more than 2c

\- Valued at $10 two months ago and was trading over $12 earlier this year.

\- Price dumped due to bug in advertising platform last quarter. It made all the revenues look \*really\* bad, so everyone dumped / panicked without looking at larger picture.

\- Positive feedback from advertisers (ie: they enjoy the experience / working with snap): https://parameter.io/snap-stock-rises-3-following-tiktok-ban-delay-and-positive-advertiser-reviews/)

\- Reinvesting heavily into their own business & still growing

\- Trading at an all time low despite all the rest

\- Some more due diligence in my other post from yesterday:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1njeymd/snap\_chats\_in\_im\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1njeymd/snap_chats_in_im_in/)

\---

Chat - why is this regarded? Why am I regarded? IMO this is easily over $10 by EOY. Change my view. DYOR

\---

Update:

To everyone saying ""SNAP IS DEAD""... you are so incredibly wrong. Snap is growing - quite quickly. It's actually (quite literally) \~20-30m DAU's from passing insta's DAU's. Users spend \~80b hours on the app per annum, vs \~100b hours on insta. To everyone saying they have never been able to make a profit & never will be able to - people said the same thing about reddit. Then they changed how ads are in the platform and it rocketed straight up. Snap has a ton of potential IMO -- they already solved the hard problems (make an app people / especially teenagers actually want to use)

1nkats2,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 11:07:19,YOLO into $UAMY monopoly,"I have never been confident enough in a stock to publish it like this, but based on the market UAMY has cornered, it's underpriced as fuck. Here's my shot at DD:

China cut off all antimony flows — first with September ’24 export controls and then a full ban to the US on Dec 3, 2024 — which choked supply to the West and prices soared. Europe has seen shipments freeze, and buyers are scrambling for non-China supply. It's important for ammo, solar glass, batteries, and IR/defense gear, and right now there is little supply for the West. 

That’s where $UAMY comes in. The only primary/significant antimony smelter in the US. It's processed in Thompson Falls, Montana, and the US is still \~80% import-reliant for antimony. Now that China’s sale to the US is gone, the domestic smelter has a US-processing monopoly. 

The kicker: antimony often rides shotgun with gold (stibnite). Perpetua’s Stibnite Gold Project in Idaho has \~148M pounds of antimony reserves and says it could cover \~35% of US demand in its early years — and DoD just threw more money at building a fully domestic antimony trisulfide supply chain. Perpetua and UAMY are working together on metallogical testing, setting up the “gold mine byproduct to U.S. smelter” pipeline the Pentagon wants. If that matures, UAMY owns the furnace.

1nk9po1,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 10:24:28,Just hit £500k - ALL IN ON HUT 8,"**Short background on my investing journey**

Started investing June 2020 with £15k. Through pure dumb luck I’ve turned it into £500k. Started off just copy trading anything that was pumping on here. First big score was $NIO at $11, sold at $50. Then followed a popular poster in here at the time, SirJackalot into a certain banned meme stock and came out with £300k.

Thought I was a genius, made life changing money doing all the wrong things, so I proceeded to nearly throw it all away losing money on every garbage piece of shit you guys shilled me. Wish, Baba, RKT, Palantir (yeah I even managed to lose on PLTR), CLF, every weed stock, you name it, I bag held it.

Went all in AMD (Hence the name) for 2 years of sideways pain, finally sold with a tiny gain. Which leads me to my current play HUT 8. Loaded up when market cap dropped below their BTC holdings after a short report in early 2024.

**HUT 8**

**AI/HPC Pivot**

Bitcoin mining is a dying business. Due to the halving, profits are halved every 4 years. Many bitcoin miners are pivoting to hosting AI HPC data centres, which provide more reliable sources of revenue. Even miners like Cleanspark who marketed themselves as 'The last pure play bitcoin miner' are discussing pivoting. These miners have been quietly scooping up cheap power for years and I believe this is not fully priced in and there is a lot of money to be made.

HUT 8 recently announced plans to develop four new sites across the US. Including a 1000MW data centre in Texas and a 300 MW called RiverBend in Louisiana which will be upgrading to 1000MW. Stage 1 for the Riverbend site is expected to be completed by Q4 2025. Therefore I believe an announcement for a deal with a hyper scaler is imminent.

HUT has a huge power pipeline of 10,800MW with 3100 MW capacity under exclusivity and 7700 Capacity under diligence.

**Bitcoin mining carveout (Creation of American Bitcoin)**

HUT 8 has gone into partnership with the Trump brothers Eric and Don Jr to create American Bitcoin ($ABTC). HUT 8 gave away all of their miners for an 80% stake in the company. HUT 8 has pretty much given away 20% of its miners for the Trump brand. Why would they do this? Like it or not the Trump name carries premium. The most expensive stock on the market is $DJT. $DJT is sitting at a $5B market cap despite only doing $1.3m in revenue so far this year. This is by far the most overvalued company on the stock market IMO. ABTC did a private raise worth $220m bringing in the Winklevoss twins which diluted HUT 8's share from 80% to 64% which puts the value at the time of the private raise just north of $1B. They then used the cash raised to upgrade their EH/s from 10 to 24.2.

ABTC has currently been public 2 weeks and as I currently sit here $ABTC is currently trading at $7.82 which puts the market cap at $7.1B and values HUT 8's 64% share at $4.5B despite HUT 8's Market cap being $4B itself while also holding 10k Bitcoin worth $1.2B on the balance sheet. ABTC is set up to be self funded and will be able to raise cash at absurd levels compared to what HUT 8 previously could without the Trump brothers while not diluting HUT 8 shares. I love this because I am extremely bullish on the AI HPC/ Energy Infrastructure side of the business and I don't want to be diluted to fund EH/s growth or the straight purchase of Bitcoin.",199,100,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nk9po1,new,YOLO,0.92

1nk5cl8,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 07:10:18,HUGE Deal Between $INTC and $NVDA,"NVIDIA and Intel announced a multi-generation collaboration across PC and datacenter and NVIDIA will invest $5B in Intel at $23.28 per share. The joint solution will be a tight coupling Intel x86 CPUs and NVIDIA RTX GPUs over NVLink for PCs and data-center platforms. Timeframe are TBD and current roadmaps with arm will not change, per sources, meaning NVIDIA will offer both.
 
Overall
 
•PCs: Intel will build and sell x86 SoCs integrating NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets
•Data center: Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA integrates into its AI platforms
•Financial: NVIDIA is committing $5B to Intel equity at $23.28/share
•Scope: Product collaboration—not a foundry manufacturing deal
 
Why it matters
 
•Windows/x86 PCs: Higher-bandwidth, lower-latency CPU-GPU coupling should lift AI inference and pro-app and gaming performance versus discrete PCIe designs. Data center: NVIDIA gains an x86 option alongside ARM; Intel attaches CPUs into NVIDIA’s fastest-growing AI platforms.
 
What we don’t know yet
 
•Ship timing, ramp cadence, and how many generations.
•NVLink specifics (bandwidth, flavor, coherence) and CPU-DRAM/GPU-HBM memory topology.
•Process nodes and packaging (EMIB/Foveros) for the PC SoC and the custom DC CPU.
•PC SoC scope (NPU, power targets, die/chiplet counts) and NVIDIA rack-level designs.
•Software stack details (CUDA/driver model on Windows/x86; Linux support).
•Commercial mechanics of RTX chiplets inside an Intel-sold SoC and CPU attach accounting on NVIDIA platforms",1359,209,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/y0btounwowpf1.jpeg,new,News,0.98

1njyqge,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 00:22:34,Blow-off top signals by Prominent Financial Strategists,"You can clearly see that almost all calls were premature (made when the S&P was much lower than it is today), and the anticipated crash still hasn’t arrived.

Blue line → Approximate S&P 500 path.

	•	Red shaded zones → Time windows when each strategist expected the crash to unfold.

	•	X markers + labels → When they made their big calls.



You can see how almost every shaded “crash window” (Dent 2024, Burry 2023, Hussman/Grantham early 2022–24, etc.) has already passed without the predicted collapse. Spitznagel’s window (2024–26) is still ongoing, so his call is the only one not yet “invalidated.”


Bottom line: as of 2025, none have been “right” in calling both the blow-off top and the subsequent crash. The blow-off part (late-cycle mania, AI surge) looks validated. The crash has not yet happened.

**$NUVB (Nuvation Bio)** was founded in 2018 by **David T. Hung, M.D. Oncology biotech** developing next-generation **kinase inhibitors** for genetically defined cancers. In certain cancers, aberrant kinase signaling is **constitutively active (“always on”)**, driving uncontrolled cell growth (tumors).

**Leadership** (see [here](https://nuvationbio.com/board-of-directors/))

* \~**70–80% technical/scientific** (MDs/PhDs in clinical, R&D, operations) vs. **20–30% commercial/operational** (finance, BD, legal).
* top education for all the technical people, past record of leading end to end pharmaceutical development
* James Bond villain Dr Sauvage is here.

Fun fact:

* past success: David founded Medivation, they worked on a drug called **Xtandi** and was acquired by Pfizer for \~$14B (2016).
* failure: David had a setback leading **Axovant** amid Alzheimer’s trial failures
* that failure is often not mentioned and is also part of the bear argument.

**Financial state of affairs**

statements are pretty clear in that regard:

* good cash reserve (already the case before commercialization).
* conservative estimates, taking out exceptional R&D acquisition, they can hold for 2-3 years without any dilution in the radar. they historically burns \~$40–50M per quarter so that's in line with what i am seeing on nasdaq
* confirmed by David during the few conferences in september and his CFO.

**If I say biotech you scream? “Pipeline”**

Pipeline as seen on their [website](https://nuvationbio.com/pipeline/):

https://preview.redd.it/2a0ybu4k0tpf1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeda40b14157044bed2bb0b9f551277829e04754

The dream scenario: Good Safusidenib clinical results

* promising data with a strong clinical study as released during the HC conference (see data)
* q[2 earning report](https://investors.nuvationbio.com/news/news-details/2025/Nuvation-Bio-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com): “*Discussions with the FDA regarding registration-enabling trials of safusidenib are ongoing, and the Company plans to provide additional updates in the second half of 2025.*”
* during HC, David **claim** that they are in discussion with the FDA to go for a Head-to-Head trial against **vorasidenib**
   * Clear intention of showing safusidenib superiority
   * They could capture a \~6B market if doing so moving their valuation by a whole bunch.

at this time, **i'll only care about Taletrectinib** (commercial name IBTROZI) for this analysis.

**taletrectinib** (the grim reality):

* **oral ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)**, FDA approved since June 2025.
* [In June 20](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuvation-bio-nuvb-taletrectinib-selected-104653135.html), IBTROZI (commercial name for Taletrectinib) received “Preferred Option” in updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC).
* August earnings have shown a different [story](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nuvb-sales-jump-1043-drug-launch): “…. driving $4.8 million in GAAP revenue, well above GAAP revenue estimates.”
* Not only that: “*According to the company, IBTROZI product revenue (GAAP) reached $1.2 million i****n just 13 U.S. business days after approval***\*, reflecting channel stocking and new patient start\*”
* \~$3.5M analyst’s revenu estimates.
* Long term data shows impressive improved PFS:
   * Patient who used IBTROZI saw better results especially when they haven't been exposed to other drugs.
   * Mild side-effects, pretty much whatever you see in all the medecines you probably have taken in your life.
* Competition:
   * [Nuvalent](https://investors.nuvalent.com/nuvalent-presents-pivotal-data-from-arros-1)’s rolling NDA (Sept 2025) approval **could** be **2026** (priority review) or later
   * When prompt about Nuvalent data, David debunked their studies: “*putting 100 robots, letting them loose on a football pitch and watching just 3 of them cross the 22 yard mark and then claiming 22 as their median.*”

**Some math** (can skip this section if lazy or go straight to conclusion)

Simple revenue model for Q3. I like to be very very conservative. I want to estimate **Q3 revenue** for IBTROZI under **worst-case** adoption, without using early launch spikes (channel stocking, free trials) and **ignoring churn** (only next quarter).

* Let **r = paid starts per U.S. business day over Q3** (**D business days**).
* If starts are uniformly distributed across Aug–Oct, average contribution within Q3 is 2 patient-months per start (way below the current 13 on purpose)
* PM = 2 \* S = 2 \* r\* D
* **Q3 revenue** is then: *R = PM/Price = 2 \* r D \* Price*\*

Using:

* Price ≈ $19.2k net/month (65% of the listed price)
* Three conservative adoption ceilings (the variable r): r = 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 **paid starts per business day**.

**Conclusion**:

* in the worst-case where we avoid early launch distortions and yield a conservative Q3 revenue range of **\~$1.15M–$3.83M (gross)**.
* intentionally, below \~$3.5M analyst’s estimates.
* analysts considered the worst case scenario without considering revenue outside the US.

**The bears 🐻🌈**

the classical ones that you would see in pretty much every biotech company:

* **Commercialization risk**: management have no proven track record **launching an oncology drug at scale** in the U.S. (yes they did Medivation but it seems that success was too long ago for our lovely bear).
* Competition risk from NUVL, Pfizer etc. (imo this can be debunked as long as IBTROZI is *best in class*, granted this could change at any point in time)
* Pipeline uncertainty: unfortunately a very good argument. it is insanely hard to be approved, hence why my analysis is only on IBTROZI

in my quest for value, i am always on the lookout for additional insider activity.

**The bet**

* currently above and analyst estimates are not considering the market outside of the US (they get some juicy royalties in China).
* possible commercial distribution of IBTROZI in japan makes it attractive, in fact Sauvage current stock price is also not considering forward looking statements made by David during the HC Wainwright conference,
* in fact none of the news article even mentioned what he said.

you can check it [here](https://journey.ct.events/view/ea2e92e3-d524-423c-a68a-fe84140ac942).

David mentioned a few points of interests:

* forward looking statements like “looking forward to the Q3 earnings”.
* (random, totally bs 2cts) hearing him talk during previous earning calls he has historically been very conservative in his statements.
* Nuvalent study being bogus and not statistically accurate
* Going on a head-to-head trial

volume is somehow low (possible quick jump in price)

**fair value of this stock: 5-10$ easily**

my 6th sense when it comes to gambling my hard earned money, the competence of the management as well as the conferences makes me think that they will beat some kind of expectations.

especially as far as patient adoption is concerned and revenu estimation.

David, you know, could you go on an other buying spree like you did pre-FDA approval? that would be highly appreciated.

\---

Paperhands pick of the day. Really that simple chat - seeings a lot of this one and no bers. I do no research, I blindly follow the crowd. Buy now, DD later. Why is this a bad investment? Tell me it's horrible. Charts look like good entrance after a dip, 470m daily active users, 13b market cap, was trading over $10 literally 2 months ago. With tik tok rumors / stuff, perhaps this one has some upside too. No idea, I monkeyed in and am doing my dd later.

\---

Update: Tripled down today after posting + doing some DD with chat. As per GPT: ""A recent Snapchat advertising bug in Q2 2025 allowed some ads to be sold at significantly discounted rates, impacting the company's revenue growth and causing its stock price to fall"". Popular with the younger generation and revenue is going up (ie: growing).

Chat told me bug was fixed, it's popular with young generation & just saw a massive dip. I blindly trusted chat. 3k leaps. Max risk exposure for me.

\---

Update #2 (more DD): ""I coach a 13-18yr old basketball team at my ymca and every single kid uses Snapchat exclusively as their primary messaging app. No instagram or X. (In Texas)"". All the young people love / still use this one. More bullish than ever. This one is gonna have a meta moment.

\---

Update #3 (more DD / some handwaved numbers): Valued at like $20 / DAILY user and all users are teenagers. That's undervalued on that alone. I'm sure they can figure out a way to extract more than $20 in revenue from that market. Lots of people have streaks exceeding 1000 days. You just gotta make (quite literally) 2cents off a DAILY user a day to justify it. That's like a single ad. This one is hella underpriced

$SNAP about to have a meta moment. Paperhands 1m long on leaps.

1njcfnv,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 08:57:42,GOOG ONE-TRICK FREE MONEY BULL CASE,"Jpow might fuck us today so let me give you a generational buy opp. I've been picking up goog $GOOG on every dip, and i'm here to tell you why this shit is literally free money.

**POSITION: 75% OF MY PORT.**

# THE CORE

* **SEARCH & ADS (NOT A MONOPOLY KEK).**  This is the free-money printer.
* **THE WAR CHEST (CASH AND BUYBACKS)** They're sitting on **$100B+ IN CASH** making billions in interest. AND they're pumping their own stock with a **$70B BUYBACK** program.

# THE HYPER-GROWTH

* **GEMINI: #1 APP ON THE APPLE STORE.** Their model is already the best. Rumor is **Gemini 3.0 is going to eat even more ass**. They have the best photo editing, best video generation, and just bought windsurf. They are winning the AI race right now, and it's not even close. GPT5 worse than Gemini pro v2.5 lmaoooo.  Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
* **TPUs.** This is the hardware *literally built for LLMs* (which is half the stock market now).  They can start selling the shovels in a 20-trillion-dollar gold rush.
   * ""Google was using its own large-scale, custom AI hardware for two full years before its main competitor""
* **AI INCREASING MARGIN**  They're plugging this LLMS *directly into the ad engine* and this means higher margins on their main money-printer. They're using AI to make the printer go *faster*.
* **CLOUD** \- GCP is growing at **30%+ YOY** and is ripping market share straight from AWS and Azure. This is the growth engine.

# THE MOAT

* **YOUTUBE.** This is video, streaming, TV, *everything*. It's the most-watched platform in the world, and Shorts is knee-capping TikTok BY ORACLE
* **ANDROID + PLAY STORE :** hey own the OS for **70%+ of all phones on earth**. Every app, every in-game purchase Google gets a cut. Bless apple
* \*\*CHROME .\*\*They own the browser that literally everyone uses.  They literally PAY firefox to exist.
* **GOOGLE MAPS:** It's a monopoly. Every other app (Uber, Zillow) pays Google to use their maps. Plus, it's the front door for all local ads. They own navigation.
* **WORKSPACE (Gmail/Drive)** They own the productivity suite for half the planet, and now they're plugging Gemini right into it.
* **SEARCH-DATA:** Yes they know everything about you.  Yes they have the most data in the world

# THE MOONSHOTS

* **GOOGLE VENTURES (The In-House Degen Fund)**  Did you know Google is basically a VC fund?
   * **14% of ANTHROPIC** (Valuation $200B 🚀)
   * **8% of SPACEX** (Valuation $400B 🚀)
   * ...plus they free-rolled into **UBER** and **SLACK**.
* **WAYMO:** Self-driving cars. The private market says this bet has **4x'd since last year**. This is the future of transport.
* **DEEPMIND & ISOMORPHIC LABS:** This is the AlphaFold shit. They are using AI to discover new drugs and cure diseases. This alone is a multi-trillion-dollar lotto ticket.
* **VERILY** The life-sciences bet. This shit already raised **$3.5 BILLION**. It's only going up.
* **QUANTUM** This is the long-term bet. If this pays off, they win....and they will.

# THE ""OH YEAH, THEY OWN THAT TOO"" LIST

* **HARDWARE (Pixel, Nest, Home)**
* **INFRASTRUCTURE (Google Fiber, Voice)**
* **REAL ESTATE (The Landlord)** They own infinite prime-ass real estate. Chelsea Market in NYC? That's theirs.
* **CRYPTO:** Yes. They're building a L1.

1niqztt,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 15:20:43,DD - CVNA and COF are overvalued,"TLDR: CVNA (Carvana) 300Put Jan2026, Jun2026 + COF (Capital One Financial) 200 Put Jun2026

Won't go much into CVNA as its been heavily discussed before, along with the much more comprehensive deep dive into their financials since a while back by [Hindenburg Research.](https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/) But I believe that while their books are cooked, the financial pressure will be too much to hide soon.

To preface this, I understand that during economic (non-market) downturns, stocks that deal with poor financial decisions like credit cards and used cars might seem like good investment, but the current situation is different than that of 2008 or 2020. Biggest reason being, [for the first time since 1960'](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/immigrant-population-shrinking-trump-administration-rcna225881)s  US population is shrinking due to the new immigration policies.

These ""recession-proof stocks"" are at very big risk simply because they finance lower income, and often time immigrants, with little to no requirements. They do not care if you're an ""illegal"" immigrant (as long as you have an ITIN), they do not care if you have no/bad credit history, and they do not check if you have the ability to pay them back. Normally this would be fine as even if you default on the loan/debt they will claw much of it back because people usually do not file for bankruptcy and tend to make the minimum payments or work with them for a new payment plan. They can also garnish your wage or seize assets if you declare bankruptcy.

Well then you might ask, how can they fail?

**COF (Capital One Financial)**

Many of the immigrants that are being deported or are self deporting, simply max out their credit before leaving. In fact, during the six month period of January to June 2025, [US immigrant population has shrunk by 1.4 million](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/08/21/key-findings-about-us-immigrants/). Growing up as an immigrant child, this was always something that I saw first hand many times in both the Hispanic and Asian communities. When people were giving up on the American dream, they would often live to their fullest applying for and maxing out as many credit cards as possible, often sending money and gifts back to their home country before leaving.

Capital One (and their recently acquired Discover) is the industry leader in offering credit to people with bad to no credit history. Their application process is very easy and often no question asked where you just claim what your income is, and they'll approve you up to $2-3k per card. Applying for many credit card at once will often be a red flag, but usually the people who are doing this have already have been living in the U.S for a while with existing credit cards. Often they'll just apply for 3-4 more cards to max out before leaving, usually totaling to around $20-30k.

https://preview.redd.it/x5czfktaukpf1.png?width=1530&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb3bffb2eb74ed2ec58f453fe0f9f3fbede42f0e

Their exposure to credit card loans has gone up significantly, over 60%, after merging with Discover, but meanwhile their consumer deposits have only increased about 30%. They are also calculating the new credit card loans acquired at a lower default rate, when in reality the allowance for bad debt should be much higher.

Meanwhile, their stock has gone up to record highs due to the seemingly increase in customer, more cards issued, and volume in transactions. When comparing to industry average, their stock price seems reasonable and correlate strongly to one another.  But in reality, COF is significantly worse than due to their high exposure to credit loans and significantly less deposits.

**CVNA (Carvana)**

While Carvana has been a long discussed stock here, and with significant amount of people getting burned trying to short this stock this year, I believe the financial pressure will finally be catching up to them.

The first half of this year, Carvana benefitted significantly from Trump's tariff war as people chose to buy cheaper second hand cars as opposed to the higher tariffed costs of new cars.  However, in the second half of next year, I believe this will change as well.

First reason being the immigration issue I previously discussed. Immigrants are often the main purchasers of use cars. Carvana does not care if you are an ""illegal"" immigrant, they will sell you a car regardless. These cars are often sold to them with high interest, financed by Carvana themselves, making their business model seem highly profitable. But these cars are often used for high mileage purposes like delivery services, often depreciating the vehicles much faster than Carvana expects. With significantly lower demand, higher delinquency on payments that are backed by a vehicle significantly more worn than expected, and their ever growing inventory size, Carvana is a ready to explode.

Second reason for Carvana's downfall is lower interest rates (soon) and the deductions new vehicle gets under Trump's new tax code. Used vehicles are not eligible for interest deduction, and lower interest rates means people are more incentivized and more likely to qualify for new vehicles.

Lastly, Carvana's competition is not only CarMax. Car buying/selling has never been easier with sites like Kelly Blue Book. They link you to your local dealership, often times getting a much better value due to lower overhead costs these dealership faces. They've also announced heavy ad spending last earnings (seems desperate and goes against their cost cutting to manage profitability motto).

All in all, I believe they are facing much bigger headwinds than just cooking their books can put off.

First time really posting here, and honestly pretty new to options. Previously I gambled on INTC when new CEO fired a bunch of people and wrote down their asset value, I assume the overstated balance and obsolete assets would be written off ASAP after a new CEO so any further decline can be blamed on previous CEO, thus their balance sheet was actually understated if anything, and bought INTC 20 Jan26 calls when it was @ $19. Open to feedback and discussion, maybe I am just gambling, maybe its an investment.

1niobby,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 13:43:04,$MSTR: Setup for a Pop Tomorrow,"
I’m eyeing MicroStrategy ($MSTR) hard right now and loaded up on some calls ahead of tomorrow’s Fed decision (September 17, 2025). Stock’s at $331 after pulling back from $457 highs, but with their 639,000 BTC stash worth $70B+ at $115K per coin, this thing’s basically a turbocharged Bitcoin play trading at 1.2x its holdings. Q2 crushed with $32.60 EPS, and targets are $540-$700 easy if BTC holds steady.
Fed’s slamming through a 25 bps cut with 96% odds, and if Powell hints at more easing, BTC should run while stocks might dip on jitters. $MSTR loves that setup, lower rates make Saylor’s debt buys cheaper, and it’s got 2-3x leverage to BTC moves. Last year’s cut? $MSTR jumped 12% in a week.

Big catalysts stacking: It’s heavily shorted (15%+ of float, all-time highs in Q2), shorts are bleeding from past rallies, and whales are piling in, grabbing BTC and $MSTR options like it’s on sale. On-chain shows whale inflows spiking, MicroStrategy just added 525 BTC last week. This screams gamma squeeze potential, especially with options flow heavy on calls (2.21 ratio) and triple witching Friday. Break $350, and it could rip to $375 quick.

Plus, Saylor’s in DC today pushing the Bitcoin treasury bill with lawmakers, aiming for the US to stock up 1M BTC over five years as a strategic reserve. If that gains traction, it’s rocket fuel for $MSTR as the poster child.
Chart’s coiling at $328-$334 support, RSI oversold, volume building. Risks if Powell’s hawkish, but jobs data’s weak, so I like the odds. Not advice, just why I’m bullish tomorrow.

\----

I don't understand the risks involved on LDI - so I can't price risk well but still wanted exposure. Chat didn't convince me price action on my options were safe from rate cuts, but I wasn't convinced they were going to drop either. So risks were high. Unlikely I follow LDI any longer past this unless it dips a lot -- I try to identify underpriced risk, which when these options were bought last week was good value. Time to find the next play. $LDI did 100b in loans a few years ago and likely to fly longer term on rate cuts / cycle. I'm unsure how long that takes / where this goes (but wanted investments still) - so deleveraged. I liked what I found, but risks are high. I \*trade\* options and invest in shares. DYOR.

I've made it very clear to chat several times that I use options to leverage my bets & take gains very quickly. I take gains out all the time. These were higher yesterday - todays timing and rate cuts coming make the risk on these higher. Longer term likely a good bet - so still invested quite heavily (50k shares). My strategy is really is this simple: buy the dip, sell the run. These were bought on the dip last week, and if it dips again I may look for another options play on them again.

My risk on these is now 0, so I don't have to follow in depth anymore. I only follow a few tickers at once. I papered out at the bottom this morning, it's up \~4% since I did this.

\[THE NEWS BELOW WAS FALSE / SPREAD BY BEARS FOR A BEAR RAID. SEE UPDATE 2\]

Update: Bought puts at EOD to hedge share risk (not posted). CEO sold all his shares today, saw this at \~4pm today (IE: AH, markets closed). That's all the bearish confirmation I need.  I'm fully out tomorrow / potentially short / puts. Goodluck chat

1nij58k,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 10:32:13,PART 2: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY,"**PART 2: The Larry Ellison Play - Paramount Skydance ($PSKY)**

Well $PSKY has had an active week. A little faster than I had originally expected, but hopefully many of you were able to trail my initial position posted last week to make some money.

* [PART 1: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nedg0a/the_larry_play_paramount_skydance_psky/)

**I figure with all the recent excitement this is grounds for a Part 2:**

1. **$WBD Deal**
   * PSKY is planning a majority-cash, Ellison-backed bid for ALL of Warner Bros Discovery. For those paying attention, WBD planned to spinoff its assets into two separate cos in 2026: one was to be studios and streaming, the other was going to be networks. There was undoubtedly going to be a bidding war for the streaming assets. By getting out ahead of the spinoff and buying the assets before the others could, Larry is boxing out the competition. We have no clue how this is going to be structured. We only know that it’s Larry-backed. That said, we can obviously expect a sweetheart deal for PSKY that totally de-risks any funding concerns.
2. **Oracle/TikTok**
   * CBS reported that Oracle is leading a consortium for TikTok’s US assets. If you think Larry’s not going to use this distribution channel to pump PSKY’s content library, you’ve got your head in the sand. There are 170 million TikTok US users (NFLX has 90 million paid US Subscribers) and 40% of Zoomers’ screentime is spent on TikTok. The conversion metrics could be huge here.
3. **Value Dispersion**
   * NFLX has a market cap of $500B. It lost like $25B in value after the PSKY/WBD deal was announced.
   *  PSKY’s market cap is $20B. It gained only \~$4B in value since the announcement.
   * Even shitty HULU is valued at nearly $30B on Disney’s balance sheet.

**I’m no mathematician, but there seems to be a mismatch here. You can buy what may become the primary NFLX competitor for a fraction of the price.**



**TLDR:** $PSKY.... HIGHER. 

  
**Position**: December/Jan Calls (Supporting Image attached)

1nhzrer,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 18:09:49,Nobody watching APLD,"Nobody on here is really talking about Applied Digital (APLD) and I think it has serious potential. The stock is sitting around 19.50 right now and it has already run over 70 percent in the last three months. What makes it interesting is not just the chart but the actual business story.

APLD is building out high performance data centers specifically designed for AI workloads. They already signed hosting contracts worth over 11 billion dollars, mostly with CoreWeave, which is one of the fastest growing names in the AI compute space. These are not small speculative deals either. They are long term leases that give APLD revenue visibility for years.

The company has about 200 megawatts of capacity now and plans to reach 400 to 500 megawatts by 2026. Each 100 megawatts can generate around 300 to 400 million in annual revenue. Analysts are projecting revenue to grow from about 450 million in fiscal 2024 to over 1.2 billion by fiscal 2026. That type of growth would support a market cap in the 3 to 4 billion range compared to about 2 billion today.

If AI demand stays hot and they continue hitting build out milestones, I think a reasonable short term price target is 25 to 27 by the end of this year. If momentum really catches on and retail wakes up to this play, I could see it testing 30. The risk is execution and concentration with a few clients, but the math lines up.

Right now everyone is watching NVDA and the mega caps but APLD is a pure play AI infrastructure stock that is still under the radar. I am betting it is going to get a lot more attention soon.

This stock was murdered from IPO & it's either a dead corpse or a huge rebound waiting to happen.

**Growth**  
Is solid, more customers drinking the Lemonade every year, renters, cars, your fat cat & your mansions.

**Shorts**  
Shorts are heavy and the float isn't big. One spark and we're balls deep in money.

Ticker is LMND. 

**Position**  
Posted below, planning to up this when I get paid from Wendy's

**Question**  
Do want a big jug of LMND with your tendies??? I know I do.

There is a play for those who are too afraid to take a position. I'm usually not a fan, but considering how fake the actual economy is versus the numbers it is about the safest play and history dictates that rate cuts drive the price up of the underlying asset.

Gold, go buy GLD shares or calls. 

These days even Bitcoin seems to sway with the market, gold is the only one that is mostly independent.

Paperhands buys first, does his DD later via shitposting in the daily. Here's some very high level due diligence. This company did \~30b in loans last year. It did \~100b in loans in 2020. It's a legitimate company and a large refinancer. The reason for the drop wasn't a failing business, it was due to rising interest rates. They refinance homes / mortgages. In rising rates - nobody does that so business looks bad. Interest rates are cyclic -- they will eventually come back down. When they do (not just 1 cut, but looking several ahead) these guys business booms as everyone wants cheaper mortgages. This can be doubly advantageous - lower rates (people remortgage) + potentially higher margins on the loans (depends how competitive they price things / where interest rates go). I chatted with a few people who have used them and they said they enjoyed the experience / using loandepots products. They advertise themselves as low friction, very quick with competitive rates. They operate in 20 countries, have \~5000 employees & a \~2b market cap. It was trading above $30 in the low interest rate environment circa 2021.

Lots of people worried about insider selling. It's a no story. CEO's compensation is primarily in shares and they jumped massively. I don't blame him for taking profits or derisking. We don't know why he sold. People said the same thing about OPEN (I was a bear also -- because insiders sold sub $1 and they tend to know stuff) -- and look where it went. Insider ownership is \~85% on LDI.

With not much additional DD, I bought more this morning. I haven't look at the finance sheet, etc - as it tends not to matter for my investment style. This is my largest position & max risk tolerances for me. I'll let chat know if positions change.

1h4vtsj,2024-12-02,2024-12-02 09:11:49,Tried to gamble my way out of debt - Didn’t work :(,"Well here it goes. 

About a year ago I dumped about 5k into a company that I may or may not have had private knowledge of. I thought I was so smart, turns out that less than a month later all my shares are worthless because the company filed for bankruptcy. 

Fast forward a couple months and my position was eliminated and I have been searching for jobs but been unemployed ever since. That 5k was a big chunk of my savings and with being unemployed and having bills to pay I quickly ran out of cash. I racked up about 12,000 in credit card debt and needed money fast. 

So naturally, I started gambling. I gambled by using this same credit card on some sketchy online casino, I didn’t deposit much at once, usually only $100 or so, but man I realized I had a gambling addiction once I spent over 4k on this site. I was making the money back but then I was chasing my losses and lost it all. 

Then autopay resumed on my card and tried to charge my entire balance which I didn’t have and Amex canceled my card. I was still making my monthly payments before that. 

So now I’m 16k in debt on this card, 3k on another, and have about $100 to my name. I sold my computers and guns and anything worth money but now I don’t know how I am going to pay my bills this month. 

Guys, please be careful, be honest with yourselves, casino gambling and options gambling are both just as dangerous. You have to limit yourself or else you are a few bad days away from being like me. 

I don’t know what I’m gonna do anymore but I thought I’d leave a warning for other degenerate gamblers like me.

The stock tanked with everything else in April during liberation day and I was down to $526. I had to deposit another $10,000 to pick myself up and take revenge on the market. 

Luckily I caught Google on the dip to 148 and I had conviction that Google was going to the moon based on its P/E and great ai plays. 

I kept buying 5% otm calls 30 days out on red days and selling when the calls were in the money. Then I would open another position with more and more contracts every time. 

The last push was this weekend before Labor Day I held $450,000 cash and unloaded it on the dip Monday at 207 and bought $4.70 950 contracts of 220 strike calls for 10/17. Those calls were up $91,000 end of the day as you can see from my previous post. Today I sold at $16 per contract.

So, I wanted to bet on Tesla mooning as a result of Trump winning due to their new close relationship, and the deregulation that was coming for Tesla in the new administration. I'm not a political person, just trading off an idea!

So here's what I did:  
  
Bought $15,000 on 3:1 Kamala bets to win $30,000 to hedge my $50,000 in TSLA weekly calls. If she had won, I'd lose $10K-15K Max. If Trump won, this happens...

1ly582b,2025-07-12,2025-07-12 12:55:03,$1.4m --> $5.4m in 18 Months - 85% in Cash Now,"I've lost a lot of sleep over the past 18 months trading my mom's IRA (she's more than ok with this!), and I've been able to substantially outperform the market.  I lost most of her portfolio 3 months ago in April (bottom tick was $800k) but have been able to grow it back to a much higher value than it was before the tariff BS.

Total gains in 18 months: $4,000,000

I have been trading options (obviously, this is WSB.) For the first 6 months, my big winner was HIMS, although I sold WAY too early. I bought calls around $10 and sold around $20-$24. My other big plays have been scalping NVDA and especially GOOGL. Despite being a lousy hold for the last year, I've consistently YOLO'd into GOOGL on big pull backs, including the Apple congressional testimony news (Google searches were down for the first time on Safari, although Google denied this.)

My strategy is to buy near or at-the-money calls 2-5 months out with at least one earnings in between. I don't usually hold through earnings. I try to scale out of the position over the course of 2-10 trading days. I'm happy with 20%-50% gains and am fine with leaving money on the table. Because the calls are many months out, there isn't too much theta decay if the stock goes sideways.

I generally keep cash on the side to YOLO into calls if there's a huge overreaction on a given ticker. If I'm fully invested, it's hard to take advantage of certain opportunities. I don't think I have that much patience, but I've definitely improved since my early trading days.

On Friday I sold most of the portfolio and am now 85%  in cash. The other 15% is in QQQ puts and UNH calls. I think there will be buying opportunities soon given the new EU / Canada tariff news, but ultimately, as we all know, taco's gonna taco.",17759,875,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/6nnlft724hcf1.png,year,Discussion,0.92

He’ll probably replace him with a DUI hire like hegseth or a yes man like Bessent. My bet is the market would react, negatively, very negatively to the news.

Powell has handled inflation and covid decently well. Managed through Trumps first term and was re-elected by Biden even though Powell is a registered republican. 

My prediction is it will be seen as massive loss in federal banking stability and result in a crash in DXY. DXY could go to 90 in first 24h and S&P to 4500 as foreign investors start trumping treasuries to get ahead of Turkey like chaos. 

Further, we could also see increased selling of bonds and yields hitting 5%. 
We could see a double whammy of 08 like financial panic with tariffs induced geopolitical damage.

25 years of historical data and it has been decently profitable, SP02 seems to be range bound from 95-100, but BPM sometimes goes way up. 

One day I finished running a marathon and checked the app and it was at 180. That being said, I am really thinking this is my next move - especially after monitoring it during the SPY moves today. It was volatile, going up and down quite a bit, but it consistently gained rather than dropping with SPY.


That coupled with the fact it’s been range bound for so long makes me think it is a prime choice for a breakout.

1gm4gzv,2024-11-07,2024-11-07 18:31:01,YOLO $35k into 1.1MM to save the family farm. ,"Fellow regards, longtime lurker breaking the silence to YOLO $32K to save the family farm.

Grandaddy died in April this year leaving a 3 generation farm, (fully paid, no debt) to my parents. Mom never worked and my dad’s income has never been much (minister at small church). Unsurprisingly, mom and dad want to cash in on that sweet sweet inheritance $$$ by selling the farm and upgrading their lifestyle with the proceeds.

I would give my right kidney to keep that farm if I knew how to sell it. It’s where I grew up, convinced my girlfriend (now wife) to marry me, and want our two small children to make their own memories there. 

I’ve traded positions in $NVDA, $ASTS, $RKLB and $RDDT (thanks to this community) hoping to somehow make enough to buy the farm but have only managed roughly to double my money ($15K to $32K). I completely realize it’s an idiot move but it’s the only chance I have at this point and I’m 100% willing to go to $0 if there is a chance I can make it to $1.1MM. 

The farm is going to be listed next week and I want to go full regard with my portfolio to buy it. If I sell my house I still need $1.1MM to make up the difference and I’m willing to bet everything I have in the market for the chance to make it happen. 

Would happily go all-in on anything that might print before February since the farm will probably be sold around that time. 

Before anyone asks, there is no other way. My folks want the $$$ now and won’t sell the farm for any less than market value to me or anyone else. Renting the tillable acres to a local farmer would only cover 1.5 months of the mortgage payment. Maybe the best offer is $800K, maybe the real estate market crashes tomorrow, but bottom line is I have to close the gap between $35K and $1.1MM to have any shot at keeping it. 

TLDR: regard wants to yolo his 100% gains on a moonshot to save his sentimentality important childhood home knowing full well he should blow it on strippers stead because it would be more fun.

1luwcrr,2025-07-08,2025-07-08 14:30:59,Trump unveils a 50% tariff on copper and threatens to impose 200% duties on pharmaceuticals,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-unveils-a-50-tariff-on-copper-and-threatens-to-impose-200-duties-on-pharmaceuticals-181231693.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-unveils-a-50-tariff-on-copper-and-threatens-to-impose-200-duties-on-pharmaceuticals-181231693.html)

President Trump said Tuesday that an ongoing investigation of tariffs on copper will end with 50% duties on the metal in remarks where he also threatened 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals.

The comments came during a wide-ranging cabinet meeting where he also said Europe will get tariffs dictated to them this week and that Jerome Powell should resign, adding more developments to what was already a week dominated by trade and economics in Washington, D.C.

“Today we're doing copper,” Trump said during the meeting, and turned to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick who confirmed that the rate will be 50%.

The apparent move will match the current 50% tariffs on two other commodities — steel and aluminum. The announcement sent copper prices immediately up over 10% before prices retreated some later Tuesday afternoon.

The president didn't specifically outline when the new copper tariff would take effect but he has the power to implement them immediately once an investigation by his administration is concluded.

The president also teased other major announcements set for the coming weeks on top of this week’s focus on “reciprocal” tariffs, saying “we're going to be announcing pharmaceuticals, chips” in the weeks ahead — a reference to upcoming plans around prescription drugs and semiconductors.

He didn’t offer a specific timeline on the pharmaceutical tariffs but suggested there could be a extended easing in period.

""We're going to give people about a year, a year and a half to come in, and after that they're going to be tariffed,"" he said, while also offering an eye-popping number for the final duty by saying it will be “a very, very high rate, like 200%.”

“We'll give them a certain period of time to get their act together,” Trump added.

His action on copper could be felt more quickly, with the president signaling an end to an ongoing Commerce Department investigation of possible duties under Section 232 tariff authority that began in February.

Trump implemented tariffs on steel and aluminum in March but held off on copper.

It was yet another aggressive Trump move on trade in a week where he threatened of 25% duties on South Korea and Japan on Monday and then said on Tuesday that a new tariff deadline of Aug. 1 won't be extended.

It was a return to trade rhetoric from Trump that has been more muted in recent weeks but was on full display during the cabinet meeting and has marked Trump's political career as part of what he says is his quest to protect America.

""People that sat in this room allowed it to happen,"" he said of previous trade policies while talking in the White House's Cabinet room, ""and I don't allow it to happen.""",10473,995,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1luwcrr/trump_unveils_a_50_tariff_on_copper_and_threatens/,year,News,0.96

I live in San Diego but I'm originally from a smaller town in California.
 
I know 5 people who just got laid off from $300k+ jobs in SF and LA, they were in tech so it's not that surprising, but it all happened quite concurrently.

What's more worrying though, is that about 1/3rd of my high school and college friends who did NOT end up moving to a major city have been laid off. Many of them are in law, accounting, or working corporate jobs in second tier US cities... and none of them can find jobs. They are between 30-40, and some of them have multiple young children.

The stock market keeps rocketing upwards... but this feels like a desperate, dying breath of people trying to YOLO their savings into money that can help them survive short term, rather than a healthy society and economy growing massively.

I get that we're in the ""AI boom"", but the AI boom is the first ""boom"" that is literally erasing white collar jobs en masse. My friend told me that his department was shrunk from 30 to 5 people, and he expects that the department will require only 1 person in the next couple of years.

Yet, everyday, a giant green dildo. Global tariffs? Green dildo. Nuclear war with Iran? Green dildo. Massive lay offs? Green dildo.

I know it's funny, especially if you're in the investor class and don't have to work... but something is beginning to feel seriously wrong. Does anyone have answers? This is the first time in my life that I have SEEN with my own eyes massive lay offs in my own social circles, who are all people with good college degrees, from good families, making at least $150k, but mostly $200K+.

Where do we go from here? More green dildos? Green dildos until the end of time? How many green dildos can society bear on it's unemployed back until its knees give out?

Why UNH? Because America’s not gonna stop getting sick. Fat, old, diabetic, stressed out, healthcare is the last thing people cut. And UNH is built like a tank. Major insider buying too.

1kkdhbo,2025-05-11,2025-05-11 18:43:23,Trump executive order: Prescription drug prices to be reduced by 30% to 80% almost immediately,"No paywall: [https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/11/politics/trump-prescription-drug-prices](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/11/politics/trump-prescription-drug-prices)

President Donald Trump announced Sunday that he plans to resurrect a controversial policy from his first term that aims to reduce drug costs by basing payments for certain medicines on their prices in other countries.

His prior rule, called “Most Favored Nation,” was finalized in late 2020 but blocked by federal courts and rescinded by then-President Joe Biden in 2021. It would have applied to Medicare payments for certain drugs administered in doctors’ offices. However, it is unclear what payments or drugs the new directive would apply to.

In a Truth Social post Sunday evening, Trump said he plans to sign an executive order Monday morning that he argues would drastically lower drug prices.

“I will be signing one of the most consequential Executive Orders in our Country’s history. Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%,” he wrote. “I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.”

The directive comes as the Trump administration is also looking to impose tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, which had been exempted from such levies enacted during the president’s first term. The tariffs could exacerbate shortages of certain drugs, particularly generic medicines, and eventually raise prices.

If the new executive order is comparable to the 2020 rule, both Medicare and its beneficiaries could see savings. But it could also limit patients’ access to medications, experts said. Much depends on how the policy is structured.

Although lowering drug prices was a major talking point of his first administration, Trump has not focused on the topic as much this term. And his campaign told Politico last year that he had moved away from the “Most Favored Nation” model, which many Republicans strongly oppose.

But the administration revived the idea recently as a potential way to meet deep spending cut targets for Medicaid in the House GOP’s sweeping tax and spending cuts package. However, it’s unclear whether the proposal will be included in the legislation, the details of which should be announced shortly, or whether it would be covered by the executive order.

The initiative will likely face stiff opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which successfully halted the first iteration.

The Trump administration introduced the idea of tying Medicare’s drug reimbursements to the prices in other countries in 2018 and finalized the rule just after the 2020 election. The seven-year model would have allowed the US to piggyback on discounts negotiated by other peer countries, which typically pay far less for medications in large part because their governments often determine the cost.

Under the 2020 initiative, Medicare would have paid the lowest price available among those peer countries for 50 Part B drugs that are administered in doctors’ offices. The administration estimated it would have saved about $86 billion.

At the time, Medicare was barred from negotiating drug prices, but that changed with the 2022 passage of the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, which gave Medicare the historic power to bargain over prices for a small number of drugs annually.

A “Most Favored Nation” proposal could save beneficiaries’ money in their out-of-pocket costs and their premiums, which are both affected by the price of drugs, experts said.",10060,2316,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kkdhbo/trump_executive_order_prescription_drug_prices_to/,year,Discussion,0.92

I believe these have meaning. He is hinting that things are going south at Intel; it’s just plain ol fearmongering. Then tonight, he publishes his big D energy earnings report and this stock will skyrocket 20%

This dinosaur company hasn't even recovered from the dot-com bubble crash, which is why expectations are so low now. I see this as an excellent buying opportunity; this company won't shit the bed today, as there's literally no expectation for them to win.

I've been on and off WSB since all inning $AMD at $5 in the Lisa Su mommy meme days. Some friends sent me the CVNA post from yesterday and figured I'd toss mine up. I tried making a DD post in late 2022 but didn't have the karma sadly. I believe I know the company better than just about anyone that isn't an internal exec.

Buys were done anywhere from $7 to $220. Rode it through a 98% drawdown and kept buying more, at one point was down about $10m on it.

Basic logic:

1. Selling cars online will be more popular over time
2. CVNA was the only large player doing that, smaller ones liquidated (Vroom and Shift)
3. Used vehicle market super fragmented so they're competing against Billy Bumfucks Bad Deals Dealership
4. I had data showing the company was cutting costs as expected and continuing to sell cars even when headlines were saying bankruptcy
5. I held as I had data showing continuously accelerating car sales over the past 18 months, with this quarter growing >50%
6. The valuation math was super sexy if they just didn't go bankrupt and grew.

Overall a fun ride. I think the stock does alright from here but sadly I doubt it 70x's again. I'd been blogging incessantly about it since late 2022 and had numerous of their execs reading. Internet DD is not always worthless!

1l30pc2,2025-06-04,2025-06-04 04:56:18,I Turned $15K into $353k… Then Lit It All on Fire in 2 Weeks. I’m Reborn. I’m Broken. I’m Back.,"never thought I’d be making this post. But here we are.

After riding one of the longest bull streaks in recent history, I did what any overconfident degenerate would do—I let logic in the room. Rookie mistake. Within two weeks, I went from $300,000 to PDT-violated, margin-called, and spiritually humbled.

I’ve been buying $10,000 same-day expiry SPY puts since mid-April. Not a typo. Every. Damn. Day.

I’m not gonna lie—I was considering launching a hedge fund. Called my dad. Called my rich uncle. They were shocked, surprisingly supportive (while I was winning, and started to discuss hedge fund possibilities!

Turns out I wasn’t a quant. I just hit black five times in a row and thought I was Rain Man. Since then? Red. Every. Spin.

I’m a changed man. But also a scared one. Every time I think about buying a call, the market feels it and tanks out of spite. I swear Jerome Powell has my phone tapped.

But it’s okay.

I started my true bull journey yesterday. Vibes are up. Regret is high. Confidence is fake. But I’m here.

The $353K+ loss? That was originally $15K of my own money. So technically… I just gave back the market’s money, right?

Give me a month or two—once I clear this PDT scarlet letter—and I’ll be back. Or not. I don’t trust myself. And you shouldn’t either.

Let’s go, bulls. But stay paranoid.

God bless leverage.

Sincerely, Tyler (AKA - a highly regarded and degenerate male).

1ny27ev,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 14:53:30,Why Redwire is my next play…,"For reference, it was $26 back in February. 

It’s only a matter of time before we get back to that and even higher. I know a good stock when I see one. Prior plays I had big wins on include early investments with archer, joby, qubt, rigetti, rocket labs, and nbis. 

Quick background on redwire. They provide avionics and sensors for spacecraft and other camera systems, software development, and assist in manufacturing other equipment used in space missions and defense operations. 

Hedge funds increased ownership by 1.6m this quarter alone, such as Driehaus Capital and Royce & Associates. 

About 65% is owned by insiders, 15% is owned by institutions, and 20% is owned by retail traders. 

We saw what happened with Rocket Labs, ASTS, and many others… I believe this one will be back to the $20-$30 range very soon, and who knows how much higher. 

Fair market value is $28 (per Simply Wall Street), which implies about a 60% upside from current levels. 

Risks: like many companies in the early stages, there is concern of cash burn and dilution. That being said, for those who may be looking for a 1-3 year hold — this one is a strong buy and hold for me at the current price with a bigger upside than downside in my opinion.

Analysts noted that ChatGPT makes up a tiny fraction of Reddit traffic, and Piper Sandler’s Thomas Champion said the company’s relationship with Google—its main traffic funnel—remains intact ; Citizen JMP’s Andrew Boone added that concerns over search‑engine optimization are “noise” and highlighted momentum in Reddit’s core advertising business .  Trefis attributed the broader decline to concerns about slowing user growth and traffic headwinds tied to changes in Google’s search algorithms and AI‑generated answers , pointing out that Reddit’s valuation is rich with a price‑to‑sales multiple around 12x .  Nevertheless, the company’s fundamentals remain strong: Q2 2025 revenue rose over 20 % year‑over‑year and advertising revenue surged 84 % to $465 million , while data‑licensing deals such as a $60 million‑per‑year agreement with Google and may be a similar pact with OpenAI provide a growing revenue stream .  
Piper Sandler reiterated an overweight rating with a $290 target   and RBC Capital described the AI‑related worries as a “healthy reset” .

1nx5a3a,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 13:19:21,The $NEXT Big Play,"Howdy brothers,

After my $CRWV post materialized into a big multibagger this week, hundreds of people have been reaching out asking me for the next big play. Well, it's a liquid natural gas company called NextDecade.

  
$NEXT got inexplicably beat down recently to $7 from the $10-12 range after announcing POSITIVE news on September 10th that it received $6.7 billion to develop its Rio Grande LNG facility. On September 12th Morgan Stanley downgraded their price target on $NEXT which further pushed it down to $6. However, this downgrade was from $15 to $10, still way above the current price.

  
There's been colossal insider buying on $NEXT the last few weeks as well. The CEO recently bought 281,500 shares. He now owns $37 million in stock which is a massive green flag. Aerospace Co. acquired 449,510 shares just last Wednesday. 

  
The 50 day moving average of $NEXT is $9.51, and the 200 day moving average is $8.69. The current ratio is .70 and the debt to equity ratio is 2.77. Financials look solid and indicate an oversold position.

For all these reasons, I believe that $NEXT will be making a big movement upwards in the next two weeks. Calls are absolutely dirt cheap, I bought $7 calls for just $.30, two weeks out. My price target for this trade is $8 plus; this stock is disgustingly undervalued currently.

  
Position: 5000x $7 call expiring Oct. 17th.

On Tuesday, the stock suddenly dipped about a dollar, and from what it looked like, someone may have accidentally hit **sell instead of buy**. It wasn’t a huge move compared to some of the volatility we’ve seen in other names, but it stood out because the drop lined up with what looked like an abnormally large sell execution at the wrong time.

Fast forward to Thursday, and things got even more interesting. At **16:00:02**, right after the close, there was a massive **buy attempt of 1,409,696 shares at $79.63 on the NYSE**. The order shows up in the trade log, but didn’t actually go through in full, which raises some questions. Was this the same trader trying to correct their earlier mistake? A fund trying to scoop up a large block at the close? Or just an algorithm glitching out?

Here’s the snapshot from the tape that shows the activity: .What makes this noteworthy is the sheer size—1.4 million shares is not small potatoes, and whether or not it was intentional, it definitely suggests someone (or something) was very interested in loading up. For retail traders, this kind of anomaly is always interesting to dissect, even if it doesn’t necessarily mean anything for long-term price action.

Still massively under the radar compared to mega-cap AI names. We’re talking:

	•	🚀 Revenue expected to triple by 2026
	•	🏦 Institutional money piling in
	•	📅 Oct 9 earnings = To the moon 🌖 

OCTOBER 9 EARNINGS could be the next launchpad. If they deliver on build + revenue ramp, this thing can see $30+ near-term and $40–50 longer term if multiples expand.

AI doesn’t run on dreams, it runs on megawatts. And APLD is stacking them by the hundreds.

The Cupertino company has moved staff from working on its new, lighter and cheaper Vision Pro to focus on its smart glasses, which would be similar to those offered by Meta Platforms, the report said, citing people close to the issue. Apple engineers are working on at least two types of the smart glasses. One is being crafted to be paired with an iPhone and will lack its own display. This could be revealed as soon as 2026. The other version will contain a display similar to the recently released Meta Ray-Ban Display.

Apple's smart glasses are expected to utilize voice interaction and AI capabilities, the report said. It would also rely on an upgraded Siri, which is projected for a March release at the earliest. They would also feature a much lower price tag than the Vision Pro, which started at $3,499.

Meta released its Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses on Tuesday, Sept. 30. They start at $799 and feature the Meta Neural Band. The AI-powered glasses allow users to ""interact with digital content while staying fully present in the physical world.""",73,96,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nvs275/apple_tables_vision_pro_sequel_to_pursue_smart/,new,Discussion,0.8

1nvpvso,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 20:53:54,$SNAP – The Only Specs That Matter 🚀,"Alright, listen up smoothbrains. While you apes are busy lighting your grandma’s retirement funds on fire buying quantum vaporware stocks with zero revenue and YOLO’ing into Opendoor like it’s the next Amazon instead of a failing real estate pawn shop, I’m looking at a stock that could 10x if this plays out. Yes, the ghost app you use to send nudes to your ex is actually a once-in-a-decade moon ticket.

[“JPow told my wife this was safe”](https://preview.redd.it/a84d6o9qglsf1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=374dc3ecc175dde106a5375911dff2da3083c33b)

Now let me explain why your mom’s boyfriend is bullish:

1. **ATH Collapse** – SNAP’s all-time high was \~$80 before Tim Apple slapped them across the face with iOS privacy changes. Ads went limp, Wall Street bailed, and SNAP cratered harder than your mom’s Tinder date. But that’s the reason the stock is sitting at 5-year lows today: **the decline was external, not because the company is fundamentally trash**.
2. **Spectacles = The Real AR Play** – SNAP has been grinding on AR spectacles for a decade. While Zuckbot embarrassed himself with his laugh-track VR demo, SNAP dropped a prototype that actually looks **usable**. Their consumer “Specs” are dropping in 2026, lighter and cheaper than the dev versions. They even built **Snap OS**, a full-blown platform optimized for AR, but you wouldn’t know that because you were too busy watching anime lolis instead of reading investor decks and paying attention to product demos.
3. **8 Billion Daily AR Lenses vs Google’s 14 Billion Searches** – On mobile alone, SNAP’s AR lenses are used **8 billion times a day**. Let me say that again: **8 BILLION WITH a ""B""**. Google search does \~14 billion daily. That means people are snapping AR dogs and anime filters like crazy at HALF THE SCALE OF GOOGLE SEARCH. When Specs launch, SNAP controls **both the hardware and the software**. That means unrestricted ad targeting, a user experience way better than the janky mobile AR crap, and here’s the kicker: they demoed **collaborative AR** between Specs users and mobile users. Imagine shoving ads in both realities at once. That’s a money printer even Papa Powell would respect.

I’m early into this play. Specs aren’t out until 2026, but the market is asleep at the wheel. SNAP’s been buying back stock in 2025, cutting costs with layoffs (10% in 2025), and getting their comp structure under control. They’re quietly setting the stage for the next wave while you guys YOLO weekly SPY puts like brain-damaged chimps.

Now, I’ll keep it real with you:

* Competition exists. But except for Meta, **Google and Apple don’t have social platforms** to tie AR into. Meta is bleeding billions on legless VR Sims. Apple’s Vision Pro flop shows that having the social layer is critical.
* Stock comp was a headwind, but layoffs and buybacks are stabilizing things.
* User growth is slowing but that’s true for all social media platforms. SNAP has 900 million monthly active users. The key is jumping onto the next big thing that feeds into revenue.
* CEO Evan Spiegel has majority voting rights. Which means if he wakes up one day and decides to turn the ghost into a furry NFT, we’re screwed. Expect some WSB level decisions at times.

**Bottom line:** SNAP is sitting near its 5-year low, the market has priced in zero upside, and the next catalyst (Specs) is massive. From here, this can only go up. Not financial advice. I am jacked to the tits.

1nvla89,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 17:34:32,Exited too early on a 40x trade…,"Been pretty shaken up about this for hours now…

Thought I made a great trade when I bought and sold this Eli Lilly call option yesterday for over +500% profit (turned $179 into $1,086 within the same day) 

I had to sell this contract and cash out because I needed the money to cover the amount I was short on rent (which was due today), pay some bills, and afford groceries & other necessities - Also didn’t think that exiting the position when it hit 6x was that conservative. 

Before anyone comes at me for “gambling to make a living/afford food & rent” - I actually work full-time in finance, in office 5 days a week. But anyone familiar with UK salaries will understand that a job is simply not enough, especially if you’re relatively young/entry-mid level, which I am (The average rent in London is higher than the average monthly take-home pay in this city…so yeah). 

I had bought this call when the stock price was $730 yesterday, and sold when it hit $760 (which was my strike price anyway). 

But if I had known that it was going to increase by 100 POINTS in 2 days (past $830), I would have obviously kept it. 

The figure at the top of this contract isn’t 100% accurate (the highest price I saw on the option chain was around $7,335), but even just based on this amount, I missed out on an extra $6,000 of profit. It would have alleviated so much of my financial stress; and having turned $179 into $7,075 with one  ~40x trade would have been an amazing feeling.

\---

Lots of people been asking me for my DD on gap - so here's a weeks worth of insights & market research into $GAP. I think there's potential, but we won't know the result until ER's.

Traditional metrics at a glance before diving in.

**Price & Value:** It's currently trading at a P/E of \~9.5 which tends to signal ""undervalued"" or ""something is wrong"". Which one is it here? I compared to competitors -- LULU has a P/E of 12 & AEO: P/E of 16.5. We need to rule out ""something is wrong"" -- which I discuss below (is GAP dead?). It's trading at a significant discount... why?

**Stability**: GAP has a solid dividend (\~3% at the time of posting) & has been around since the 1960s. It is a very well known and recognized international brand that's not going anywhere.

**Sentiment**: Everyone I chatted with was bullish on GAP. I didn't see many real big bear arguments other than ""it's a dead brand"" and ""insiders sold 500k shares"". I commented on those below & would like to hear more views on why this is a bad investment or my thesis is wrong / will not play out.

**Team:** You can do your own research into the executive team here, I had a glance over a few people. They have a solid team who can execute & who I believe are genuinely interested in turning the company around. Current CEO ran Mattel for a long time & was heavily involved in growing barbie, hot wheels & fisher-price. He's been CEO of GAP for \~2 years and doing well via his playbook. The rest of their executive team also has an impressive history. Price hasn't really moved in the last 2 years despite good execution (imo).  [https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/about/leadership/executive-leadership-team](https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/about/leadership/executive-leadership-team)

**Current Average Analyst PT:** \~24.4

**Catalyst**: They just launched their most successful ad campaign ever -- I validated it was real myself. I haven't seen too many in the investing world talking about it. See the reference source below (another WSB's DD) for tik tok impressions - it's over 100 million views on just one video. Their youtube ad has over 3x the number of impressions as the AEO ad did and the campaign is considered by many to be ""more successful"". They got over half a billion views in aggregate. **The ad campaign started on AUG 19th, ONLY 9 DAYS BEFORE THE LAST ER's & resulted in an 8.5% increase in foot traffic during the first week.** The rest we don't know (we can only speculate). We won't know the true results until next ER's. I looked at the google trends for bullish terms related to this campaign / ad -- see below. We won't know if this was a one off event or the start of a trend until ER's.

**Similar Events:** AEO launched a highly successful ad campaign (Sydney Sweeney has good jeans). I looked at their google trends & diffed them. The trends on this one actually did jump on this ad campaign, similar to how AEO did. And the jumps seemed more pronounced on GAP.

\---

**Trends (correlated to online sales):** \~40% of gaps sales come from online, some search terms spiked by 200-400% interest. GAP order spiked by \~450%, GAP buy by \~500% & some other related terms I looked up had similar spikes. We're operating on incomplete information here -- I can't quantify how the trends map to sales (they do tend to be correlated tho). Search interest != sales

\---

**Trends (correlated to in store sales):** \~60% of sales comes from in store (citation needed -- someone clarify numbers please). This jump in august (ie: before school season) doesn't typically occur. There is a periodic trend that can been seen spiking in November (what happens in nov???). I noticed this across all search terms. Search interest for ""Gap location"" spiked by a staggering 800% and ""Gap store"" spiked \~300%. The Aug / sept spike doesn't usually occur - it's a unique event (which I suspect is related to the ad campaign).

\---

Relative spike / comparable one for AEO (It also lasted a similar amount of time). For comparison purposes. For reference -- AEO is up from $11 to $17 (55% since they started their ad campaign). GAP is up... \~2% (\~$21 -> 21.7)

**Insights**: TLDW: Focusing on growth, brand. Mentioned ad a few times -- but didn't push it or mention potential impacts much. CEO dropped some hints, but I don't think they were picked up on by many

**\~28:40** (Katrina O'Connell, CFO): ""Last quarter, we previewed an estimated net tariff impact of fiscal twenty twenty five of approximately 100,000,000 to 150,000,000 from the April trade policy. I am proud that the teams have since mitigated the majority of that impact. Reflected in our outlook today is the estimated incremental impact related to the latest trade policies effective August 7. Starting with full year 2025 net sales, **we continue to expect net sales to be up 1% to 2% year over year**. Our outlook assumes ongoing strength at Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic, and a longer recovery at Athleta.""

**\~42:40** (Richard Dickson, CEO): ""This campaign, which launched last week starring Katseye, has driven record breaking response for the brand. Early reads. This is striking range of probably being one of the most iconic brand campaigns certainly that we've done, but that is out there. People aren't just watching, but they're actively joining and **suggesting that this is actually a cultural takeover**. These are great proof points and elements that, again, the playbook is working"".

**My read / take:** They are forecasting not a huge jump in net sales & didn't push the ad super hard as the results were unknown. They mentioned their ad got 20million views in the first 3 days. I don't think people paid too much attention to it on the call, via the Q&A at the end. Search for ""eye"" in the transcript - it was only mentioned twice as far as I can tell. GAP has had a beat on the last 8 ER's. You can validate this yourself. They seem to undersell themselves on guidance / projections each time (ie: I think CEO might sandbag guidance to get beats every time). Tariffs were mentioned \~30 times on the call - I think that's the concern most analysts had (risks) & was a major discussion point (dominating the ad campaign)

\---

**Bear Arguments:**

**Insider Selling (recent 500k):** For people worried about the recent 500k share insider sale. I looked into it. As per google: ""Following the transaction, Mr. Fisher directly owns **12,835,433 shares**, indirectly holds 2,829,502 shares by trust, 132,257 by spouse and 22,015,000 by limited partnerships"", ie: **he owns \~38million shares** still. He's been a director of GAP since 1990 & he sold \~1.5% of his stake. **He's 71**, probs just want a house on the water or something. **I give him a pass.**

**GAP IS DEAD:** I asked around a bit (including talking to girls in the bar, and had 3 friends go to the store and talk to employees / view foot traffic). I don't believe this is true. Several of the girls I chatted with were into GAP (aged \~24-28) and two had even heard of the katseye ad. I asked a few investors to chat with their kids / wives / etc, and several were into GAP right now (who previously were not). I don't have a large enough sample size to say much about this -- but talking around I don't think it's true. I even went as far as had a few friends physically go to the stores and chat with employees. I got some mixed reviews on how much busier gap is, but the general consensus was ""its been getting a little busier these last few years""

**Low Trade Volume:** Welcome to buying things market hasn't noticed yet (or just be completely wrong, both are possible). Nobody was talking about GAP on the investing forums I frequent / lurk. It has very little volume, IV is super low. It's cheap via all traditional metrics as compared to competitors. I suspect people will start to look at / evaluate GAP as we get closer to the ER's. I really have no idea tho -- low volume just signifies to me that not many people are looking at it (yet) - which gives me a little more confidence in my thesis. It means I'm either early or just wrong. The catalyst outlined \*already occurred\* and I'm just trying to price in the effects of it. The general consensus I got from other investors (who hadn't looked at anything) was ""gap is dead I thought?""

**Tariffs:** As per above, tariffs were mentioned \~30 times during the last ER's. It was a major talking point, and although it is a risk, imo it's been priced in already. Literally everyone already knows about them & all the analysts considered them when coming up with their existing estimates. ie, imo, priced in.

**I need more bear arguments, please comment bear arguments or correct / highlight misinformation in my thesis. Why won't this thesis play out? I'm aware that trends != sales, I'm operating on incomplete information. If we all knew the results of this it'd be perfectly priced in already**

**Some sources (WSB DD):** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping_up/)

TLDR of the DD: Super successful ad campaign (similar to how AEO used sydney sweeney) - but GAPs is looking more successful. Their Youtube ads got over 3x the number of views in a shorter period of time compared to the sweeney ads & GAPs ads have also been insanely successful on tik tok - generating hundreds of millions of impressions. It went viral with the younger generation. Inventory related to the campaign was sold out across the board everywhere the original DD guy looked.

**Comparison of AEO vs GAP campaign (ie: fighting for cultural relevance).** [https://www.brandvm.com/post/gap-vs-american-eagle-ads-2025](https://www.brandvm.com/post/gap-vs-american-eagle-ads-2025)

TLDR: Looks like GAPs campaign had larger impact & even resulted in increased foot traffic during the first week.

**Another high level source / thread:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american\_eagles\_earnings\_blowout\_is\_bullish\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american_eagles_earnings_blowout_is_bullish_for/)

TLDR of the DD: Similar catalyst for GAP as AEO.

\---

**Realistic price targets:** Putting a P/E target of \~12 (imo it is growing after what I looked into) puts the price target up to \~27.5-28.0. They've beat their last 8 er's and market isn't rewarding them for it yet. Their executive team has been delivering ever since Richard Dickson took over as CEO. I also suspect sales may come in hotter than expected resulting in a beat, suggesting even higher targets. I don't see much more downside here, I've been averaging into more calls

\---

**Poker room:** I posted my positions to WSB's. I was doing DD / market research in the comments with some other investors. Mods silently removed it after a week without telling me. A lot of people picked up on this & asked me why it was removed. Mods didn't give me a reason -- I'll let you guys decide why they would do that

\---

If you can't stomach the volatility in my positions - then my trading style is not suited for you. I'm either early or wrong, we will know at the next ER's.

Sentiment is just awful for after missing numbers quarter after quarter. 

What I like: -Massive DAU and MAU, still growing users, albeit not in North America.

-Revenue is growing YoY, albeit at a low rate.

-Subscription revenue is at $700mm annualized now. They’re aggressively trying to grow it, most recently by requiring a subscription for Memories storage of over 5GB.

-Spiegel is out in public making a lot of speeches and seems to be fired up in turning the ship around. His recent letter to employees showed he has some renewed vigor and talked about “start-up like returns”.

-Balance sheet is ok, leverage ratios are fine. They have time to turn this ship around, there are no dangers of breaching any debt covenants. 

-Valuation is cheap and the stock has been left for dead. Market has no faith in management and it feels like the company only exists to enrich insiders. I like this because it’s priced for failure, yet a hint of a turnaround can easily make this a multi-bagger.

What I don’t like:  -Company can’t seem to turn a GAAP profit. Too many employees, too much investment into non-core such as Spectacles; a lot of fat needs to be cut. 

-Excessive stock-based comp. They are sensitive to it and recently started buying back stock. Dilution rate is decreasing.

-Gross margins at 51% are low for this type of business.

-User growth is mainly in India, where ARPU is around 7x lower than in the U.S.

What needs to happen for the stock to re-rate:

They need to start growing revenue double digits and start showing positive free cash flow every quarter going forward. 

One way to do that is by growing the subscription revenue aggressively as that gets a high multiple and is fairly steady high margin revenue. Keep coming out with must-have features that are only accessible to subscribers.

Another way is to cut a lot of employees. Too many mouths to feed, too much comp, and not enough to show for it. Layoffs are sad, but necessary, headcount keeps growing double digits while revenue doesn’t.

(Working Draft)

Originated: 02/01/25 10:27 am CST

Last edit: 02/18/25 3:14 pm CST

 

Authors note: I've been holding on to this for a couple months; after getting exactly 0 job interview (and being correct on the first hypothesis), I wanted to share with y'all in hopes that you may profit.

 

Primary Hypothesis (moderate-strong confidence):

The commercial real estate market is potentially entering a more turbulent period.

Despite the strong economic recovery since 2020, the commercial real estate space has continued to struggle, particularly office space.  
  


As monetary conditions remain relatively tight, it is possible that mortgages written on properties in a low-interest rate environment may struggle to be refinanced; this may be exacerbated by workflow trends, increased vacancies, and stagnating fundamentals  
  
Secondary Hypothesis (moderate-weak confidence):  
  
The insurance industry largely prefers to reinvest premiums in fixed-income and interest bearing assets.  
As we have transitioned from a low-rate environment to a high one, I anticipate that any risks associated with low-yield instruments held on balance sheets have been properly hedged by now.[\[1\]](#_ftn1)

However, with an increased cost of replacement materials due to elevated inflation/wages and increasing prevalence of natural disasters, I believe that underlying market fundamentals may have shifted; the underwriting process is becoming more challenging. In the pursuit of greater returns (and based on personal/quantitative analysis), I believe this industry may be seeking out returns in a manner that is sub-optimal.

 

Tertiary Hypothesis (weak confidence):

As banks have shied away from lending, private credit, private equity and non-banks have stepped in to fill the gap in lending. This tends to be less regulated, and may be implicated in the above referenced.  
  
\*I will probably ignore the last hypothesis for now.  
  
  


**Initial Data:**

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/zya7ce5shcsf1.png?width=539&format=png&auto=webp&s=520736582f5944d516723cdf9c4fe3fe1b2106b2)

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/uc3ilg2vhcsf1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=401b3c794e24b3727feb095a4d00f30d27022011)

  
Fred Data:  


Figure 1 shows the total amount of commercial real estate (CRE) loans held by all commercial banks through Q4 2024.[\[2\]](#_ftn2)  Figure 2 shows the annual change of CRE loans through Q4 2024.[\[3\]](#_ftn3)

Comparing the two, the percentage annual change became positive in Q4 of 2012, experienced (at least two) local peaks in Q1 2015 and Q3 2022, and has been below single digits in the last two quarters (2024 Q3: 0.3%, Q4: 0.6%).

A critical component of loan origination is the Federal Funds Rate.

 Below, a table that includes the total value of these underlying loans, 3 months pre/post the calendar month in which the Federal Reserve changed the direction of interest rates:

 

 

  
  


 

||
||
|Date|Amount ($B) or rate shift|Change ($B)|% Change|
| 9/1/2015|1734.044| | |
|12/17/2015|rate increase|97.746|5.636881|
|3/1/2016|1831.790| | |
|5/1/2019|2230.241| | |
|8/1/2019|rate decrease|63.294|2.837989|
|11/1/2019|2293.535| | |
|12/1/2019|2320.046| | |
|3/3/2020|rate decrease|64.232|2.768566|
|6/1/2020|2384.278| | |
|12/1/2021|2531.718| | |
|3/17/2022|rate increase|129.685|5.122411|
|6/1/2022|2661.403| | |
|6/1/2024|2998.333| | |
|9/18/2024|rate decrease|8.457|0.282057|
|12/1/2024|3006.790| | |

 

This would seem counter-intuitive: when interest rates rise, the magnitude of change over a +/- 3 month period is greater than the magnitude of change when interest rates fall.[\[4\]](#_ftn4)

There are at least two (or more) likely explanations for this:

1.      In an economic environment where rate increases are warranted, lending activity is elevated. When interest rate decreases are warranted, lending activity is depressed.

2.      When interest rate increases are expected, origination's are increased in anticipation. When interest rate decreases are expected, originations are delayed in anticipation.

I have also analyzed this 1 month pre/post (not included): a similar pattern exists and may be included in further versions.

Market depth:  
  
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis[\[5\]](#_ftn5), the Commercial Real Estate Market was valued at $22.5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Back then, banks and thrifts held the majority of the $5.9 trillion debt (50%), followed by Government-sponsored enterprises(17%), insurance companies and securitized debt (approximately 12% each).  


According to Statista, the total in 2025 is expected to be $25.79 trillion.[\[6\]](#_ftn6)  
  
According to Janus Henderson, the Commercial Mortgage Backed Security market is worth approximately $1.7 trillion as of Q4 2024.

https://preview.redd.it/56lykeo0icsf1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c4bf1c5fe061270bacbd55522fb4e338c48984a

**Background (CRE/Office emphasis):**

The data suggests that the United States remains in a period of economic expansion. Through Dec. 2024, the benchmark indices have gained more than 50% in two years.

However, recent GDP growth has slowed in the most recent quarter (2.3% Q4 2024 vs. 3.1% Q3 2024).[\[7\]](#_ftn7)  
  
The author of this document is restraining this document to a specific segment of the macroeconomic picture: commercial real estate.

For example, a recent article from Commercial Real Estate news states that there was 5.8 million sqft of negative absorption in the most recent quarter, with 57 million sqft for FY 2024. National vacancy for office space sits at 20.9 percent, up from last years 19.4 percent.[\[8\]](#_ftn8)

  
49 out of 93 office markets recorded negative absorption in the latest quarter.[\[9](#_ftn9)

  
The entire space has approx. 5.46 billion sqft of space. Average asking rent was $38.20/sf, up from $37.67/sf a year earlier, representing 1.4% increase in rent overall.  
  
(Author’s note: I intend to add more to this)  
  
Data:  
  
**Graph #1: CMBS Issuance Data (**generated from csv file; Source :Trepps)  


 

https://preview.redd.it/1p0c4wk7icsf1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b84d0922fb35ab1430986dd5d9a4d11ec31ade



This is a time series of CMBS issuance data, in $T(Q2 2024-Q1 2010). In a vacuum, when analyzing risk assets, one would assume an exponential slope. I am not certain that applies here.

  
A notable inflection in the data occurs between the Q3 and Q4  2019 data points ($1,595.9 Billion to $1,634.4 B, a sequential change of \~$38 B). The following points a less steep increase, starting in 202

The slope of the graph starts to accelerate for the Q2 – 2021 data point (as the economy began re-opening), and began to flatten again in Q1 – 2022. The Federal Reserve beginning to hike interest rates in March of 2022.  
  
(simplified) context: origination tends to slow in rising/elevated interest rate environments, and the term of loans for commercial real estate properties generally have a duration of 5-10 years.  
  
The Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates in September of 2024, and they have fallen a full percentage point; however, inflation remains persistent, and the current signaling is no further cuts until June of 2025. Below, the head and tail of a CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) table.

The above two graphs represent delinquent loan count by type and a delinquency time series, respectively. without having a dataset to work on but briefly (Jan. 25):

‘Office’: 10.03% (only two time points have surpassed this: July 2012 and December 2024)

‘Retail’: 6.72%

‘Lodging’: 5.76%

‘Multifamily’: 1.55%

‘Industrial’: 0.44%

**Additional Individual Analysis:**

This is an extension of a series I wrote between December 2022 and March 2023. While lacking precision, I was correct in predicting the conditions that led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

I am taking a more measured approach now, but the following are personal observations that I have made as a resident of Dallas, Texas.  
  
I started noticing many “For Lease/For Sale” signs, in addition to ones that were there before I lef

This is an image of an approximate 3.5 mile route I drove. Residential zones are in gray, while yellow zones are commercial properties.[\[10\]](#_ftn10)

In total, I counted 17 different signs advertising space for rent.  
  
One of the signs that stood out most prominently for me was Engvest. I went to their website, where they advertise “over 1 million sqft of property under management”.[\[11\]](#_ftn11)  
  
Going through the total listings I manually collected a dataset (n=96 with at least one redundant entry). the listed spaces were for entire buildings, not units; large amount of rent/sale prices were listed as “negotiable”.

  
Here’s a few included as a reference:

  
  


||
||
|Address|Square Feet|Cost (generally per SF)|Cost (Purchase)|Notes|
|14355 Torrey Chase Blvd | Houston, TX 77014|2900||269900||
|2152 W NW Hwy Ste 122 | Dallas, TX 75220|2515|negotiable|||
|5876 E Berry St. | Fort Worth, TX 76119|12500|7000.00/month(total)||Industrial (note: says $7500 in ad)|
|5611 S Custer Rd. | McKinney, TX 75070|34300|negotiable||Note: digitally rendered photos|
|3811 S Cooper St Ste 2404, Arlington, Tx 76015|714||75000|Actual restaurant|
|10595-10669 HWY 49 | Brookland, AR 72417|546678||435,000.00|Land|
|1818 E Overton Road | Dallas, TX 75216|1800||200000||
|123 Executive Way | Desoto, TX 75115|10800||Call for pricing||
|1600 N. Plano Rd. | Richardson, TX 75082|48487|Negotiable|||
|315 North Greenville Avenue | Richardson, TX 75081|25743.96|negotiable|negotiable||

  
Of note is 3876 E. Berry St., that has a listed price of $500 less per month than what was written in the body of the text, a property that only appeared to be digitally rendered, and an actual, running restaurant (it was BBQ but I forget the brand).

\*Note: I seem to remember the data being different when inputting, so a similar pattern may have occurred elsewhere

 

**Skyscrapers:**  
  
After gathering these data points, I was looking to find a firm in order to investigate further.

I found a company listed as the Texas Hedge Fund Association listed at 1700 Pacific Ave, Dallas, TX, 75201. I went in, talked to security and went to the listed suite #4100; completely vacant.  
  
I went back to the security desk at the front and asked for directions to the 14^(th) floor; that floor was vacant as well (see below).

 

In total, out of the 49 floors in this skyscraper, 20+ were vacant. Below, a snapshot of that property from LoopNet[\[12\]](#_ftn12):

https://preview.redd.it/hv3xgnojicsf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=de8d4535c545616172601bea0a27c33938612aa4

4 stars and A class building. I suspect the A class rating was obtained through renovations, so would anticipate that it gets relegated to “B” in 2026.  
  
**Texas Real Estate Investment Association Pitch:**

I decided to attend an employment/investment pitch held in Dallas, TX. The final two hours being devoted to commercial real estate; the analysis of the speaker was that we were going from a “hot” residential market to a “lukewarm” one. Commercial real estate was were the “big money” was to be made.  
  
Return on investment was projected to be 100% over a five year period, with a standard LTV said to be 70% and a typical rent increase of 10% year.

 At the end, the presenter was asked by the author about office space:

“We don’t invest in any office space, a lot of those properties are selling for $.40 to $.50 on the dollar”.  
  
The author was then talking to a broker seated nearby. Through the conversation, the broker shared that they work as a lender with various insurance companies; with customer premiums (and the lack of payouts through claims), investments were being made in commercial real estate properties. These were largely non-securitized, so they did not have to reference the SOFR benchmark.

 

**Demographic Change and Building Forecasts:**  
  
For this portion of analysis, I am planning to compare demographic changes for metropolitan areas and CRE vacancy/construction (in progress).  
  
Selected entries from a quarterly report from Lee & Associates (Q4 2023 to Q4 2024, Head/Tail):

https://preview.redd.it/s9mel60oicsf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=73f47aaaaadc1bd87a26f3ebf36306872bf3189f

Briefly, on average, cap rate went up, U.S. vacancy rate went up, sale price went down, SF under construction went down, inventory went up.  
**More skyscrapers:**  


https://preview.redd.it/k7qr1lgvicsf1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=00449b2e2ceaeb762d4c34550a8de8fe9fc094ac

  
The green building, from conversations with employees, had an occupancy rate of 70%. The blue building had no permanent tenants (save potentially a café), as it was being converted to apartments.

Below, one of the yellow properties:

https://preview.redd.it/ijzluxfxicsf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4270a522e6e9ea2c17b07a15e8fdfe785cc10b9d

 

Using the smaller of the two estimates: 176,xxx/592,xxx= 70.3% occupancy at best.  
  


**Where does this show up on financial statements?**

A good place to look is on balance sheets of banks that now hold real estate due to foreclosure. Loan origination and loans held for sale are also starting points, but imperfect. If this were to be of material impact, I would expect this to appear (after the fact) in credit profiles. Pre-arranged revolving credit agreements may be a fruitful starting point as well if worst case scenarios are assumed.

**Is this temporary? Are we at the end of a cycle?**

My inclination is no, and that the real impacts well be felt in the coming quarters.

**How can one potentially profit from this?**  
There are multiple ways. My starting point is trying to find regional banks most exposed, non-bank lenders that may be extending loans on properties where the fundamental and market values are different, and (hopefully) analyzing CMBS tranches in more detail to understand if the property loans that underly them are actually as sound as stated.

Sky is the limit, too much noise recently.

UiPath partners with OpenAI to integrate its advanced AI models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-5, into enterprise automation workflows. This collaboration, announced on September 30, 2025, includes a dedicated ChatGPT connector that combines OpenAI's frontier models with UiPath's orchestration tools to speed up AI agent development and deployment. It also features a new benchmark for evaluating computer-use models in agentic automation, along with support for Large Action Models (LAMs) to handle complex business processes. OpenAI models are already embedded in UiPath's Agent Builder, and the company offers official connectors for the OpenAI API in its Marketplace, allowing seamless use of LLMs for tasks like text generation and decision-making. This builds on earlier integrations, such as Azure OpenAI Service via Microsoft, but the direct partnership focuses on enterprise-grade AI enhancements.

1ntyifa,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 20:12:11,DD: why i am all in BITF,"Bitcoin Mining to Gov-Grade AI Cloud?

1. Board Appointment Signals a Pivot

On Aug 18, 2025, Bitfarms appointed Wayne Duso (ex-AWS & Dell) to its Board.

Why this matters: Duso helped scale AWS GovCloud and Dell’s $B+ businesses. His expertise is hyperscale cloud + government compliance (FedRAMP, FISMA, DoD IL5/IL6).

Speculation: Bitfarms may be lining up federal certifications for its Panther Creek (PA) site. These are must-have for handling sensitive workloads like defense AI model training.

Quick primer:

FedRAMP High → secure federal cloud for sensitive but unclassified data.

FISMA High → compliance for “severe consequence” data breaches.

DoD IL5/IL6 → Controlled Unclassified Info (IL5) and Secret (IL6) – critical for DoD AI workloads.

Add Duso’s background → very plausible Bitfarms is positioning Panther Creek for Gov/DoD AI contracts (think AWS-style premium pricing).

2. Revenue Potential – AI Cloud vs. Mining

Industry benchmarks (2025):

AI Data Centers: ~$12.5M/MW gross → ~$5–7M/MW net in PA.

Colocation: ~$1.3–1.5M/MW (TeraWulf).

CoreWeave (PA): ~$6M/MW.

Texas & NY AI Cloud: $4–6M/MW (more volatility + higher energy costs).

Panther Creek specifics:

1 GW potential → scale to 500+ MW.

Nuclear + hydro power at $0.02–0.03/kWh via PJM grid (super cheap).

80% NOI margins if certified + locked with a hyperscaler (Amazon, etc.).

At $5–7M/MW, Panther Creek could generate $2.5–3.5B/year net if 500 MW is deployed.

3. Quebec Pilot – AMD MI300X Advantage

Early 2025, Bitfarms repurposed part of its Saint-Hyacinthe (QC) site (~50 MW) for AMD MI300X racks:

Memory Edge: 192 GB HBM3 vs. H100’s 80 GB → fewer GPUs needed for large models.

Cost: $15–20K vs. $30K+ H100 → ~20–30% lower TCO.

Efficiency: 750W TDP; Quebec pilot hit 85% GPU utilization on vLLM inference.

Software: ROCm 6.0+ now supports PyTorch + Hugging Face.

If scaled at Panther Creek:

Revenue boost → $6–8M/MW (thanks to AMD’s pricing + cheap power).

Quebec tests already yield 2–3x mining margins.

4. Talent & Partners Lining Up

James Bond (yes, real name) hired as SVP of HPC on Mar 26, 2025 → likely behind the Quebec AI pilot.

T5 Data Centers provides lifecycle ops, certifications, and multi-year contracts → exactly the type of partner hyperscalers demand.

Locations = edge:

Pennsylvania: Cheap/stable nuclear, undersea fiber routes to EU/Africa, political support for data centers.

Washington: Hydro < $0.03/kWh, West Coast hub with fiber routes to Asia.

5. The Big Picture

Bitfarms is quietly building an AWS-style AI/GovCloud pivot → with nuclear-backed capacity, AMD MI300X pilots, and GovCloud talent.

If certifications + hyperscaler deal land (Amazon is the obvious candidate), Panther Creek could turn into one of the highest-margin AI data centers in North America.

Bitcoin mining may become the “side hustle”; AI cloud could be the real money printer.


TLDR:

Wayne Duso (ex-AWS GovCloud) joins Bitfarms → signaling FedRAMP/DoD ambitions.

Panther Creek (PA) could net $5–7M/MW/year, scaling to multi-B revenue.

Quebec pilot proves AMD MI300X racks = cheaper, more efficient vs. NVIDIA.

Talent + partners (James Bond, T5 Data Centers) strengthen the case.

Locations in PA + WA give Bitfarms strategic energy + fiber advantages.

Speculation but very plausible: Bitfarms is morphing from BTC miner → AI cloud Gov/DoD player.",205,86,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/vpvwexcf27sf1.jpeg,new,DD,0.91

(For reference, here are a couple of my older bangers:)

First play was UNH Jan 400 calls. I opened the position in mid-July, then doubled down and averaged heavy on August 1 when UNH flushed to \~240. Bagheld through Buffet pump to 320, the dump back to 290, and finally unloaded on the rip to \~342. Paper hands would’ve been obliterated, but I diamond-handed it until the pop to \~342 and cashed out those calls.  
[Screenshot 2: UNH buy and sell orders](https://imgur.com/OOg0VQs)

With fresh ammo, I went heavy into FIGMA/LIGMA when it cratered from 140 into the 50s. Snagged it around $51.9, rode it up, and dumped at $58.4.

And then the final boss: went all-in on TTD at $44.18 average.  
[Screenshot 3: Order history — UNH, FIG, TTD trades](https://imgur.com/7qf3zFv)

Now I’m just holding 40k shares of TTD, sitting at just over **$2M**.

Plan from here: looking to cash out around $55–60 on TTD. After that, might take my tendies and start scooping up some beachside condos in Mexico. Real estate can’t rug you with one bad earnings call.

Not financial advice, just the dumbest smart luck I’ve ever had. 🍻

Trump will rig $INTC to go up, forcing companies to partner with them and build their foundry business, for national security and his pride.  


INTC has a trump put, if he sees the stock starting to struggle, he will manipulate it back up.  It’s embarrassing for him to buy a stock with the governments money and watch it go down, especially since he’s known as a business man.  A lot of bad press will occur.

WSJ Reports that the Trump Admin has committed to help intel “find new customers to bolster the foundry business”$TSM is at $1T vs $INTC $150b, a lot of room to runA single meaningfully 14a foundry contract by Apple, xAI, open ai, etc will send INTC up 30%+ overnight.  Why would these companies not at least baby commit to this, to appease trump and get favorable treatment in the future?The US is the most powerful country in the world, and to have that in your back pocket of a company is a scary cheat code.  US takes their national security seriously, and they will insure Intel wins.

Reasons for it to go down

Trump announces he doesn’t care about onshoring US semi manufacturing anymore and shifts policy to globalist mentality and allows free trade of semis

US sells 10% stake in INTC

Reasons for it to go up

Announcement of new investor

Announcement of big company supporting intel

1ntoip7,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 13:37:11,"CRISPR ($CRSP) - Sector Tailwinds, Insider Buys & Massive SI","**Hello again, Donald Pump here,**

I hope you are all enjoying the major tendies of my previous 3 posts. I am back again with a new idea which could just sequence brilliant autist genes into future WSB degens for generations to come... 

**CRISPR Therapeutics ($CRSP) - Sector Tailwinds, Insider Buys & Massive SI:**

* I know what you’re going to say: “But Donald, I bought this with Cathie Wood in 2021 and now I am down 70%.” And while that may be true, it’s never too late to make it all back in one trade.

**Regulatory and Political Tide Turning**

* QURE’s new gene therapy essentially cured Huntington’s disease. This is a rising tide lifts all boats moment for gene therapy, and CRSP is the OG.
* The government is already all over this – RFK has supported fast tracking experimental gene therapies, and just this month the FDA published additional guidance on how to navigate this process. There’s now more focus and more eyeballs on this space than ever.
   * **From Reuters**:  [US Health Secretary Kennedy looks to fast-tracking approvals for rare disease drugs](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-health-secretary-kennedy-looks-fast-tracking-approvals-rare-disease-drugs-2025-06-05/)
   * **From Politico:** ""The FDA Published a series of gene-therapy draft guidance on expedited development and review, methods to capture product safety and efficacy data after approval and innovative clinical trial design for the therapies in small populations.""

**Insider Buys**

* There are rarely insider buys at this company. Look at this chart. The last time insiders bought was the stone cold bottom of the taper tantrum in 2018.
   * In July, Simeon George bought $50mm of stock through his fund, SR One. He has been on the board since 2015 and we have not seen anything like this from him before.
   * Another board member, Douglas Treco bought $1mm in August. He has been on the board since 2020 and we have not seen anything like this from him before.
* When insiders who have been with the company for years start buying millions of dollars in the open market, it’s time to pay attention. 

**Fortress Balance Sheet**

* The company has $1.7B in cash and hardly any debt. This is enough to fund operations for years.

**Shrt Interest**

* Last but not least, shrt interest is **30%**! This is about as high as It’s ever been. CRSP is not going to run out of money and it now has a narrative tailwind.
* Q4 is news-heavy for biotech's ahead of the JPM conference in January. For CRSP specifically, keep an eye out for a November heart conference update on its one-shot cholesterol program, faster rollout stats for its sickle-cell gene-editing treatment, and any tidbits on its cancer cell therapy pipeline.

**TLDR:** There is more excitement in the gene therapy space than there has been in years. Insiders are buying, the company has a lot of cash, and shrt interest is just way too high.

**Disclosure:** I am not a biotech analyst, I am just a retard with a Bloomberg terminal. NFA DYOR.

**Position:** JAN 80s

1ntofvm,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 13:34:11,JBS N.V. DD,"JBS: An Investment Thesis
The Bull Case (Pros)
The U.S. beef industry is a  case study in supply-side economics. The fundamental bull case for JBS is not about today's price, currently $14.65 at writing, but about the multi-year tailwinds that are set to drive profitability. Analysis shows that JBS is a long-term play.

1. Low herd count : A Long-Term Tailwind
The single most powerful catalyst is the U.S. cattle herd, which has shrunk to its lowest since the 1950s. This is a structural issue that will take years to resolve. While a tight supply of livestock is a headwind for JBS in the short term, it is a massive long-term benefit. The futures market for live cattle is already pricing this in, with contracts for April 2026 and beyond trading at a premium. This indicates the market believes we are in a seller's market and beef prices will persist, allowing JBS to command higher prices.

2. Diversification and a growing global market 
JBS's strength lies in its diversified portfolio. The company's U.S. beef business may be facing headwinds, but its other segments are thriving. The company's poultry (Pilgrim's Pride) and pork businesses in the U.S. and its international operations in Australia and Brazil are consistently delivering strong profits. 
This diversification acts as a crucial hedge against the volatility of the U.S. beef market, allowing the company to remain profitable even when its largest segment is facing negative margins. The company's ability to maintain profitability in a challenging environment is a testament to the resilience of its business model.


3. Strategic Investments and Growth Catalysts
JBS N.V. is not sitting back idly; it's actively investing in its future. The company is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to modernize its U.S. facilities, which will increase capacity and efficiency. The company is also making strategic acquisitions, such as its new plant in Iowa, to expand into higher-margin, value-added products like ready-to-eat bacon. The company's new dual listing on the NYSE under the ticker JBS is a major catalyst that will attract more institutional investors and increase the stock's liquidity and visibility.

4. Noticeable spike dates: 8/29, 9/2, 9/3
Current short position is 24 million shares representing 7% of the outstanding float. This represents a 24% increase from the prior month. 

The Bear Case (Cons)
While the long-term outlook for JBS is strong, investors must also be aware of the significant short-term risks and headwinds. The bearish case for JBS is not a bet against the long-term cycle, but a bet on the timing and the potential for new threats to emerge.

1. Narrow profit margin is real 
JBS's profitability is a major short-term concern. The company's North American beef division reported a negative EBITDA, a direct result of the high cost of livestock. While the company's other segments are profitable, the negative margins in its largest business segment are a significant headwind that could impact future earnings and dampen investor enthusiasm.

2. Regulatory and political uncertainty 
The U.S. beef industry is an oligopoly, and this market concentration has attracted the attention of regulators and politicians. The company faces the risk of antitrust lawsuits and new regulations that could impact its business model and profitability. While these risks are difficult to quantify, they are a significant factor in the company's valuation. The company also faces political risks from a potential U.S. tariff on Brazilian beef, which could affect its global supply chain.

3. The Risk of a slow recovery 
The bullish thesis on JBS is based on the idea that the U.S. cattle herd will begin rebuilding in late 2027. However, this timeline is not guaranteed. A sustained drought or other macroeconomic factors could delay the recovery, which would prolong the company's profitability struggles and erode the time value of a long-term call option.

4. The business model not without flaws
JBS's core business model is a low-margin, high-volume operation. The company is highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, and it has to pay for a massive supply chain, a significant cost. The company's focus on diversifying into new business segments is a sign that it is aware of these risks, pivoting to a higher-margin business is not guaranteed to be successful.

5. The Options market pricing 
An astute options trader would recognize that even though JBS's options were a good value when bought and better value now based on historical volatility and implied volatility. 
they are now trading at a premium. The market is now pricing in the very catalysts investors have been waiting for. A buyer of options at this point is paying a higher premium for the same potential reward. 
Peer  comparison  and conclusion
Peer Comparison: JBS vs the ""Big Four""
To truly understand JBS's valuation and strategic position, it is essential to compare it to its peers.
 * Tyson Foods (TSN): Tyson is JBS's direct competitor. both companies are facing headwinds in their beef segments, Tyson's greater vertical integration in its poultry business and its stronger brand recognition in prepared foods give it a slight advantage. However, JBS's global scale and direct exposure to the Brazilian and Australian beef markets make it a more direct play on the global beef cycle.
   * Stock Price: ~ $54.50
   * P/E Ratio: ~ 24x
 * JBS (JBS):
   * Stock Price: ~ $15.50
   * P/E Ratio: ~ 7.5x to 15x
The earnings multiplier (P/E ratio) shows that JBS is currently trading at a significant discount to its main publicly traded competitor, Tyson Foods. This suggests that the market is valuing JBS's stock at a lower multiple of its earnings, which could be an opportunity for a long-term investor who believes in the company's ability to return to higher profitability.
 * Cargill & National Beef: Two companies are privately held, which means their financial performance is not publicly disclosed. However, their presence is critical to understanding the oligopoly structure of the U.S. beef industry. The fact that the ""Big Four"" control 85% of the market is a key factor in JBS's long-term profitability.

Conclusion
The debate between the bull and bear case is a classic one. The optimal strategy is to synthesize both views and create a forward-looking plan that maximizes potential while mitigating risk. A recommended way forward is to:
Monitor the key catalyst 
A successful trade is based on a clear thesis and well-defined catalysts. The most important catalysts to monitor are:
 * The Cattle Herd: The USDA's forecasts for the US cattle herd are the most important metric to watch. A clear sign that the herd is beginning to grow would be a massive signal to the market.
 * The Global Business: Monitor the performance of JBS's other business segments. Continued profitability in poultry and pork would give confidence that the company can navigate the headwinds in its U.S. beef business.
 * Analyst Ratings: The recent ratings from JPMorgan and B of A  are pointing in the right direction. A sustained period of positive ratings and price targets would be a powerful signal that the market is finally coming around to a new way of thinking.
The Risk vs Reward
This trade is now a bet on a specific outcome, that the market will continue to re-rate JBS's stock to a valuation that is more in line with its long-term potential and peers

Forget Nvidia AI GPUs for a sec, I found the ultimate boomer stock with the most WSB energy imaginable: **Hillenbrand ($HI)**. Yeah, I know, sounds like a law firm or a casket company. Spoiler: it *was* a casket company. Now it makes boring plastic machines for Nestle and General Mills. Yup, exciting stuff.

So why should you care? Because some **private equity giga-chads (Apollo, Lone Star, Stellex)** are sniffing around like wolves at a nursing home buffet.

Here’s the kicker:

* EBITDA = \~$418M
* Normal boring industrial buyouts go for \~9–10× EBITDA
* Do the math: that’s a buyout price of \~$3.7–$4.0B EV → translates to about **$33–$36 per share**.
* Stock is sitting at $26.6. Bruh.

Now the fun part. Some **smart money lad yeeted $1.5M+ into $HI $30 calls expiring in November** right before close on Friday.

So we’ve got:

* Real buyers (Apollo don’t mess around).
* Real EBITDA math saying $33–36/share is the sweet spot.
* A PE bidding war.
* A random whale throwing $1.5M into illiquid calls like it’s a DraftKings parlay.

My dumb brain translation: either this dies in a ditch and we all lose money, or we get the juiciest $7–10/share tendie pop when a deal hits. My guess? **70% chance this goes through, 30% chance we’re bagholders crying into our Costco caskets**

So obivously, I YOLO'ed 50k into it. If you want exposure to *actual* smart money degeneracy instead of lotto scratchers on SPY weeklies, $HI might be the boomer rocket you never expected.

Based on my analysis target price: **$33–36**.  
Expiration date: **hopefully before our (at least mine) contracts do.**

TL;DR This company was killing it before tariff, still making a lot of things, all in the US of A. There's a bidding war and company will be acquired, I expect 7-8x EBITDA, so based on some sophisticated advanced complicated math, I think stocks will be at least $33 once it's announced or goes through.

Spent the whole lot on Intel shares (120k, 60k margin), and used every last dollar on calls ($900). The cool thing is, every time your account grows, available margin does as well. $900 > 7.6k then doubled on margin again and so on. 

Sold out all my options +114k, with my biggest single day gain at just under 120k. Still holding shares and 40k cash, finally breaking a qtr mil. 

Now the boys over at $HOOD are testing me again, dangling a shiny bag of 250k margin in my face. Do I retire a winner or run it back? I think we all know the answer…

Tldr snap has begun and likely will continue to print.

I will be trading in and out for the next 6 months.





Adding dd here for context (dyor not financial advice etc etc)


Here's the thesis in short:

1. Snap went public at a 23 billion dollar valuation and had 404 million in revenue, now they are at a 14 billion dollar valuation and have 5.3 billion in revenue. 

2. They have a billion monthly active users, more than 12% of the world population.

3. They are making a push to permanent net profit, they launched a subscription model in 2022 (called Snapchat+), it's now at 700 million in revenue and grew 60% y/y in q1 2025 to 15 million users. Highly expect this to continue to grow at a tier 1 rate. (3 days ago they announced if you have more than 5gb of storage you'll pay $1.99 a month or can subscribe to snapchat+ for 3.99 a month, this should move the numbers too in a very strong way)

4. Evan wrote a letter to employees and shareholders a little while back, (I'm paraphrasing here) highlighting how he's not happy where the company is at, their competitors are all valued at 5x-100x them, and if they execute properly there could be startup like returns on their publicly traded stock

5. Their stock dropped at last earnings due to a technical one time error in their ad pricing software, this has been corrected and hasn't been priced into the stock. Stock is trading at a valuation that implies doom.


Oh and a Saudi prince buying up the company. (Now owns 2.5%)

1ns8te3,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 18:56:00,Follow up on my stock market journey,"Following up on my stock journey. About 6 months ago, I posted my portfolio gains at about 1200% in a little over 6-7 months. In about another 4-5 months time frame, I got the portfolio up to $80K and now back down to $74K.

Strategy is still the same and simple, buy low sell high. Obvious right?

Well, the biggest key strategy or let’s say mindset shift when I started winning is getting desensitized to money. Build a high conviction play, stick to it, DCA if it is lower and company stays the same, and don’t get stop lossed too early.

One of my biggest wins this year was UNH. It is a high value company, got some bad news and dropped like a rock. Market tends to OVERREACT ALWAYS and on either sides too. Bad news = overreact to the downside, then price rebounds to stabilize. Same way on the upside, good news = price surge overreaction and will correct to the range. I bought the dip at around $300 kept DCA to $290 and sold at $350. (I’m back in)

I also study macro trends, and market sentiment. Right now, market is ATH, overall sentiment is bullish HOWEVER, short term wise there is a lot of fear baked into the market. So, theoretically, if traders see big red candles, the downside pressure is higher. So I will be a bear and short most of the day if market is red, looks weak and I don’t see that V shape recovery that I usually see. (Indices did this past week)

I also study the price action, I don’t care about RSIs, MACD trends, etc those are all historical indicators. Nobody will know what the price will do next. But if you really take a look at the chart in one minute frame and study how it behaves: for example AMD, a lot of the time I noticed in the morning it shoots up 2-3%, market is not too bullish, I will scale in my puts because I know that there are no bullish news on AMD and that I notice that the price fades most of the time.

There are other strategies that I use, for example having QQQ SPY up with AMD, where QQQ will drop and AMD will drop in a delayed manner (30-60 seconds after) and might take advantage of that knowledge. A lot more to this, and can explain further.

Currently I am in BMNR and UNH as my two holdings, but unsure of market October. We were supposed to drop September and I feel as if market will drop October and rally into holiday season. But I don’t know that yet, need more data thus still in my positions long.

1nrvnxd,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 09:46:36,Upcoming OKLO Catalysts That Could Push It to $200+,"**TL;DR**: The biggest near-term catalysts for Oklo ($OKLO) are (1) Regulatory licensing filings with reduced fees now in effect, and (2) LOIs converting into binding PPAs with data centers/hyperscalers. DOE programs, insider alignment with Sam Altman/OpenAI, analyst coverage, and operational milestones round out the key drivers.

Disclaimer: This post is for informational purposes only and is not financial advice. It reflects analysis and opinions based on publicly available information, and any price targets or scenarios discussed are speculative. Investors should do their own research, consider their risk tolerance, and consult a licensed financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

⸻

**1. COL submission + reduced fees**:
The most important inflection would be Oklo submitting its Combined License (COL) or amendment under Part 52. A formal filing or acceptance letter moves the company onto a clear regulatory track toward construction/operation, reducing uncertainty and drawing institutional interest. Timing is favorable: as of Oct 1, the regulatory body lowered hourly rates for advanced reactor reviews, cutting licensing costs and making a filing even more attractive.

**2. LOIs → binding PPAs**:
Revenue visibility is the other big catalyst. Oklo already has public agreements and LOIs with data center operators (including a 12 GW framework with Switch). The next step is converting these into binding PPAs or project-level offtake contracts. If a hyperscaler or large operator signs a binding deal, it would instantly validate Oklo’s commercial model and likely re-rate the stock.

**3. DOE programs and pilot selection**:
Oklo has been selected under DOE pilot initiatives, and further DOE funding awards, pilot milestones, or fast-track inclusions would be visible de-risking events. Federal recognition both improves credibility and makes financing easier.

**4. Insider support (Sam Altman & OpenAI)**:
Filings show Sam Altman’s Hydrazine Capital still holds ~3.15M shares. Beyond that, Altman is also CEO of OpenAI, which has been clear about the massive energy requirements to scale AI compute. In a recent blog post, he said OpenAI will soon announce energy partnerships and new financing ideas. With his dual role and financial stake, Oklo is a logical partner candidate. Any announcement connecting the two would be a blockbuster catalyst.

**5. Analyst coverage shifts**:
Goldman Sachs recently initiated at $117 PT while others like Wedbush sit higher at $150+. Coverage from major desks matters because it shapes fund flows, especially if sentiment consolidates more bullish.

**6. Operational milestones**:
Incremental updates- site permits, readiness assessments, procurement contracts, or construction financing- are less flashy but reduce execution risk. Analysts track these closely, and they matter for building institutional confidence.

**7. Short-interest dynamics (secondary)**:
Borrow availability for OKLO has been tight at times, which means positive headlines can spark outsized moves. Serious investors usually don’t trade on this, but it helps explain volatility and is relevant for tactical positioning.

⸻

If Oklo successfully executes on its near-term milestones; including regulatory licensing, binding PPAs, and partnerships with entities like OpenAI- some analysts and investors suggest that a price target of **$200+** could be achievable, reflecting the company’s long-term growth potential in the nuclear energy sector.

[**Here’s**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/qp3BDzfZxs) my last post from 10 months ago, where I predicted that $OKLO would overtake $SMR in market capitalization.

1nrki5j,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 23:03:04,30k yolo call on OPEN,"I’ve got \~$30k in long calls on Opendoor ($OPEN). Here’s why I think this stock is positioned for both long-term growth and a potential market re-rating.

# 1. Undervalued Relative to Market

* **Market Cap:** \~$7B, which is tiny compared to the multi-trillion U.S. housing transaction market. Even a modest share of this market justifies a higher valuation.
* **Valuation:** Price-to-sales multiples remain compressed compared to other real estate tech players. If margins improve, OPEN has serious rerating potential.
* **Operations:** Risk management has improved, inventory exposure is down, and operating losses are narrowing. They’re not circling the drain - they’re stabilizing.

# 2. AI Integration Push

* CEO Kaz Nejatian recently sent out a company wide email regarding having employees have a more AI centric approach. (Can check his last X post)

* This suggests OPEN is evolving into a **data-driven housing platform**, not just a home-flipping company.
* Early adoption and daily AI use among employees show this is more than a PR move — it’s an operational shift.

# 3. Leadership Upgrade

* Kaz Nejatian is the new CEO, and this is a big deal. Before OPEN, he was COO at **Shopify**, where he played a key role in scaling one of the most successful e-commerce platforms of the past decade.
* Shopify stock went up around 600%+ during his time at Shopify.
* Strong, proven leadership is often overlooked in stock pricing but can dramatically improve execution and investor confidence.

# 4. Why Now

* **Technical Setup:** Chart has broken out of consolidation, with momentum building.
* **Macro:** Housing headwinds are well known and arguably priced in. Even stabilization could trigger sentiment reversal.
* **Catalysts:** New CEO narrative, AI integration, and upcoming earnings are all potential positive triggers.

**Conclusion:**  
$OPEN looks mispriced for what it’s becoming: a leaner, AI-powered housing platform with a strong CEO who has scaled complex businesses before. With improved operations and a push into tech-driven growth, this is a value play with real upside.

**TL;DR:**

* \~$7B market cap vs. multi-trillion housing market = undervalued.
* AI integration = real operational advantage compared to other real-estate companies.
* New CEO Kaz Nejatian (ex-Shopify COO) = strong leadership.
* Long-term bullish — I’m in with \~$30k calls.

I see another huge opportunity on $CRWV now. This stock is one of the backbones of the AI cloud computing play. There was just a monster dip on literally zero news, so I'm betting hard on a rebound next week. 

  
They keep racking up monster deals with big players in the AI space, and spend on cloud compute isn't going anywhere anytime soon. I foresee a run to $135+ next week.

And at that point I knew there was something up with the Nebius chart that I had to do DD on. 

And then I realized the it was like when Sword Art Online came out. It was off to a good start then fell off season 2, which is why the chart declined. 

Then we see star symbols of waifs. I can't read Japanese, but I know it's cute. So stock price went up. 

Then it got replaced when demon slayer came out. the movie was great. And that's when we get serious with the TA. Tanjiro's hairline is spotted on the 1 month chart. That means it does have something to do with Demon Slayer. And because if we analyze the macro environment of the spike of Nezuko Body pillows by 80% after the Demon Slayer movie, we should also see a 80% spike in WEebius group.

Tanjiro always gets up after he gets beaten up, which is just manic character anime plot armor. Even despite a drop today, NBIUS will keep getting back up and going up because it's overpowered. There might have been some resistance because of weed haters, but we should follow body pillow sales, not what other people think.

AI runs on GPUs, right? RIGHT?

The answer is it depends. And most people (including developers) don't know that, but they will know, eventually

Let's begin with memory bandwidth from now on BW

Each token generation requires accessing ALL model weights, that means for each output token you need to load the entire model so how fast you load that model in memory, for that bw was the major limitation of CPUs ultill the next gen

The current top xeon has 0.614TB/s which is a ton, and could be working on dual configuration with 6TB RAM at 1,7TB/s but Top GPUs like A100 have 2TB/s and H100 has 3TB/s, the next generation of Intel Xeon 18A is expected to have \~2TB/s. Positioning near A100.

BW tl;dr: \*\*Usually doubling bandwidth roughly doubles token generation speed  
BW deepdive:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is\_inferencing\_memory\_bandwidth\_limited/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is_inferencing_memory_bandwidth_limited/)



Let's keep going, usually big chunk papa models cannot and will not work on a CPU period, but advances in quantization(from now on Q\_) made possible to run big papa models like gpt-oss 120b run on a CPU with a loss in accuracy near to 2%

Usually models are based on 16B and Q\_ down to 8 or 4, each time you half the number of bits, it halves the model size. For example GPT-OSS could run Q\_8 with only 60GB what makes possible to run at any modern workstation CPU RAM. You have 2 modules of 32GB DDR5? Boom you can run Q\_ big papa models

Q\_ tl;dr: CPUs can run big models on RAM now

Q\_ deepdive: [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/)

[https:\/\/developer.nvidia.com\/blog\/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization\/](https://preview.redd.it/xjqr7wqojcrf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b50372aec5d17a684cfa3882534067d4bd58844)

Let's talk about money, while a GPU is the king and surpasses the CPU in every metric possible, CPUs are crazy energy efficient and versatile, but what does it mean? It means that server providers are more prone to buy a CPU because they have a wider set of applications, and not only inference so they can have less idle time and more money back from their chips, since we discussed earlier, not everyone needs the biggest model available and token generation speed in new Xeon processors with CPU tokens per second sucks vs GPU they are not even close, but! Look at performance:

[https:\/\/www.nscale.com\/blog\/cpu-inferencing-why-not](https://preview.redd.it/8h79t8kqjcrf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3f3f23a5491adf4064be81e5af3be9a53dd86c)

Oh boy, you can bet small to mid-sized businesses are going to notice this, since this graph is not suitable for large environments where inference is handled by a cluster using vLLM or other software that allows load distribution and pipeline parallelism.

And they are not only crazy efficient but Intel is positioning at the most competitive chips for LLM inference per dollar:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel\_6944p\_the\_most\_cost\_effective\_cpu\_solution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel_6944p_the_most_cost_effective_cpu_solution/)

Lastly, the necessity of private LLM execution for small and mid-sized businesses is a niche that perfectly meets CPU inference.

[https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/](https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/)

On top of all of this, Intel and NVIDIA reached an agreement which announcement literally says: ""For data centers, Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market.""  
[https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products](https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products)  
So you can bet every board in a data center that works with Nvidia will have an Intel-manufactured CPU, which means that NVIDIA could be one of the first clients of the new Foundries that could be followed by other manufacturers and fabless chip designers.

tl;dr: buy intel

1nptl01,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 21:10:46,This stock is NEXT - DD,"Winter is coming… and I think this one is NEXT, positions last pic

I know this position is risky, I might roll but this is why I’m here:

The idea is simple: insiders are loading up right as the company locks in real LNG growth and heads into winter. In the last week directors filed multiple open-market buys: William Vrattos purchased 100,000 shares at a weighted average $6.864, Edward Andrew Scoggins Jr. bought 15,000 shares around $6.46, and a separate Form 4 shows director Jason Dillow’s purchase disclosed on Sept 18–19. These are actual “P” code buys, not grants, and total seven figures of fresh skin in the game.

Why now matters. On Sept 9 NextDecade reached positive FID and financial close on Rio Grande LNG Train 4, and management guided that Train 5’s FID is expected before Nov 15 after recently signing a 1.5 MTPA, 20 year SPA with EQT for Train 5 volumes. Winter gas demand historically tightens the LNG tape, and sector prints like Sempra’s Port Arthur Phase 2 FID this week underscore that U.S. LNG build-out is still accelerating into year end.

The setup is that real project de-risking plus visible commercial deals plus unusually large insider buying can force a rerate from distressed expectations. With shares around the mid-$7s today, the near-term upside case is straightforward: Train 5 financing headlines or additional SPAs into winter could be the next leg while insider conviction anchors the floor. Size it like a volatile mid-cap LNG developer and respect headline risk, but the combination of fresh director money, new FIDs, and contracted volumes is exactly the kind of catalyst stack that can keep propelling this higher.",581,184,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nptl01,new,DD,0.92

1npru94,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 19:48:15,"Is Gold Overbought Or Is There Still More Upside Left? Here's Our
Simple Technical Analysis and Thoughts.","Gold is now at $3760ish at the time of this post and holding, but is the momentum going to continue, or will we see a pause in the price movement upwards? Having been a Precious Metals Analyst since 2005, here are my thoughts...

I think this recent bull market in gold started once it cleared $2100 and broke out to the upside, which happened in March of 2024, mostly from Central Bank buying and investor demand. Since then, it's been on a gradual ascent upwards with some pauses and consolidations before making the next leg higher. At the beginning of this year, the US started bringing lots of gold from London (LBMA) and shipping it to the US, let's say at a price of about $2800-$3000. This is something I haven't seen in 20 years, so I think that puts a floor on the price of Gold at $3000, I don't think we will ever see gold under $3000 ever again, unless we get a MAJOR BlackSwan event and total all markets liquidation, and even then, that $3000 price of gold could hold as the floor.

So, currently at $3750, can gold continue higher to $4000? Yes, I think so. The rate drop cycle that has started in the US is one of the factors that caused gold to break out of the $3300-$3400 consolidation price range this summer. If we get more interest rate drops, I think Gold goes to $4000, based on this alone, but how much further it goes beyond that is yet to be seen. I would be happy with $4000 on gold in the next few months, or maybe into early next year.

There is a seasonality to gold price movements, but since the beginning of 2024, it hasn't followed the normal patterns, and I think that's because this new bull market started then, and probably has many more years ahead of us. But once the interest rate drop cycle ends, gold will have peaked out and may retrace back to major uptrend support lines, and consolidate for the next major move, up or down.

These are just some of my initial thoughts, and I will continue to pop in on this REDDIT once and awhile to share more thoughts and updates if people here are interested. ",0,43,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/dlg1dqxx87rf1.png,new,Discussion,0.35

1npnj6l,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 16:45:36,NVTS Navitas Semiconductor Run Incoming (NVDA Blackwell),"I’m picking NVTS for AI and Data Center Expansion. Basically this is a company specializing in next-generation power semiconductors, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) technologies. These are used in high-growth areas like AI data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), mobile charging, and renewable energy.

•  NVTS eyeing revival through NVIDIA AI synergies—volume’s solid, but P/E flags caution. Buybacks could turbocharge if fundamentals align; divested $100M+ last year signals pivot potential.

•  Risk-reward tightening.. Upside from scale-ups and partnerships; downside on costs/delays.

•  Pre-market buzz tied to EV/AI tailwinds—partnership expansions and earnings guidance in focus.

•  Shares breaking 50-day MA on volume—technical setup for extension if momentum holds.

•  Despite revenue dip, EV/semi growth narrative intact—optimism hinges on delivery.

Not financial advice, DYOR, but if AI infrastructure bottlenecks persist (hello, NVIDIA Blackwell), NVTS could be the under-the-radar winner. At the current price, I’d say the room to run is to $16 after $9 breaks. We saw this on APLD. This narrative is the play.

Q3 earnings Nov 3 could spotlight AI progress; ECCE and WiPDA conferences in Oct/Nov for tech showcases; CES 2026 prep might drop EV bombshells via VREMT. Recent manufacturing ramps and CEO shakeup already juiced the stock 40% on news. I’m in for 700 shares already. When I hit 10K it’ll be a YOLO.

6 YEARSS OF PAIN AND MENTAL TORTURE.

Bought 100 contracts 130C on 8/12/24 with 12/19/25 Expiry. Sold before today’s pop :( and they’re worth $52ish last I checked but whatever.

Honestly I wish I never found this sub, I can’t remember the last time I didn’t file the 3k loss on my taxes. I just kept putting money into random options while scouring this sub.

At the worst point I had lost 120k of my own hard earned money. Throughout the years I had made the money back through some crazy WSB plays (GymeStonk, Iron net, etc) and within a couple days I’d be back to a huge loss. 

I finally started looking for value plays with LEAPS and my biggest option play were these BABA calls. I bought them with a year and a half DTE with half of my account value. For some reason I wanted to hold for at least a year because I had a feeling and here we are. It was hard to stomach the ups and down constantly but it paid off.
I think I’m done for a long time, I keep checking Robinhood for my next play out of habit but I think I’m going to delete the app after withdrawing it all. I put most of my BP in SGOV for now for dividends.

My advice: If you’re young and naive and lurking in this sub, don’t start trading options, I honestly got lucky. Maybe use a small percentage of your income for risky plays but not your entire investing budget like I did.

- Golden Dome contracts (total project will be $175B+) 

Company catalysts : 

- Neutron on the pad 
- New Neutron commercial contracts 
- Neutron launch 
- EBITDA > 0 

Neutron is a structural change within the company that will bring Billions in revenue over the years, couple it with the current market conditions and it gives you rocket fuel 🥁 for one of the best positioned company of the next 10+ years

Price seems pretty low currently so I bought in.

The Trade Desk (TTD) continues to demonstrate its strength as a long-term investment in the evolving digital advertising space. The company’s robust demand-side platform enables advertisers to manage and optimize data-driven campaigns across various channels, including connected TV (CTV)—a segment growing rapidly as traditional TV declines. CEO Jeff Green has previously stated, “We process more transactions in one day than Visa does in a year,” underscoring the scale and efficiency of their real-time bidding architecture. TTD’s platform is built on transparency and independence, positioning it well against walled gardens like Google and Meta.

Institutional confidence in TTD is also rising. Notably, Intech Investment Management LLC boosted its stake by over 5,700%, Los Angeles Capital Management LLC initiated a $68.6 million position, and ARK Invest (Cathie Wood) recently added 210,664 shares (~$29.5M) to its ARKW fund. LaFleur & Godfrey LLC and several others have also increased exposure. These large bets from respected hedge funds signal strong conviction in TTD’s scalability and future cash flow.

Given its proven leadership, deep industry integration, and consistent innovation in programmatic ad tech, TTD is well-positioned for long-term growth—especially as advertisers shift more spend toward measurable, real-time channels like CTV.

A few years ago I had heard that Rolls Royce was working on Nuclear Powered Rockets, and thought that would be fun. ( Makes me think of Halo reach space ships) 

I had a small amount of cash leftover in my Roth IRA and purchased RYCEY, and wow has it blown up; granted its been a few years coming.

  
Not a professional, and never made a DD before, but it still feels like space and Nuclear are on a roll of sorts, and have more to come in the future. Maybe buying into RYCEY right now is worth a shot? 

Currently I only have around $7500 to spare, and I added back into RDW when I saw that dip below $8 a share!

\[FINAL UPDATE: Sold out for \~5% profit after 8 days\]

Options were kinda expensive on this one so I didn't think they were underpriced. Being said - lots of shit / potential catalysts around this one that I am unsure if market has priced in yet. Look at all NVDA's recent partnerships (OpenAI in particular - I'm looking at you). I believe micron provides the memory for nvidia GPU's and it may have potential to go brr. Dunno - it's an ER play. I actually don't really know what these guys do to be honest, just lots of chatter & I blindly trusted chat. I'm likely rotating out of micron within a week. These were bought this morning as I rotated out of $SNAP calls. I didn't like how options were priced on this one so monkeyed into shares instead.

It's already ran 40% last month, so high risk. I love buying the top.

Goodluck to all in the cino

\[Update\] Literally flat. Boring. My call about options being overpriced was correct, these are up \~0.5% if AH holds tomorrow. Glad I bought shares & didn't play options here. Theta gang printing tho. I'm up like 5-10k on the AH movement. Theta gang & shares won this one.

\[Update 2\] Might make like 1.5-2% on these tomorrow. Seems to be trending upwards. Lots of people bullish in the other threads - suggesting a hold is an alright bet. My read about overpriced vol seems to be correct tho - options are not the play on this one. I'll update chat when I exit. Goodluck to all.

1nolrsv,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 12:17:08,$SNAP - Final update. Rolled all options profits into shares (20k share freeroll),"Same shit I did on my other plays. I trade options which I believe are underpriced, tend to very quickly take profits (usually in < 2 weeks, despite the fact I'm trading leaps) and roll profits into the underlying. IE: $SNAP. IMO this one is likely to run over 10 after the next ER's (the drop was due to a bug in their advertising platform). I stand by my previous investment + DD.

My trading style involves using leaps / far expiration options for risk mitigation (ie: if my thesis is wrong - I can just keep holding / re-evaluate) & to leverage my bets. This one made me \~16-18% in a week, which is a fantastic return IMO. I got a 20k snap share freeroll out of it - which IMO should pay very well. I don't like following things long term with options, so just hold shares on things I previously followed.

For evidence of risk mitigation - look at my history for how I played GTLB. I bought before ER's and they ate a -12% overnight (while I was long OTM calls). I woke up to a \~25% unrealized loss. I held for 2 weeks and managed to sell for a \~5% profit - as I re-evaluated risk matrix after the drop & decided it was positive EV to continue to hold.

I only follow a few tickers at once & never went broke from taking profits. Rotating my trading capital elsewhere into another (imo) undervalued thing. There's a few on my radar.

Secretary of Defense, Hegseth’s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no brainer. 

The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies. It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports.

""While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,"" Hegseth said in the video online. ""Not anymore.""

The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by ""approving hundreds of American products"" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a ""variety of low-cost drones"" made by American engineers and AI experts.

The order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use.

""Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,"" the memo said.

Lastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars.

""Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,"" Hegseth wrote in the memo.

The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace.

As of their recent Town Hall announcement, RedCat has finally received the green light from the Army to announce LRIP (Low Rate Initial Production) portion of the SRR contract. Announcing 690 systems rather previous 550. Their guidance for fiscal year is 80-120M projected to hit 55M for Q3 this year. Today, they announced their first delivery of 45 systems for a total of $3.5M. We did the numbers and it took them approximately 3.4 days to deliver 45 drones, which indicates they can easily produce, deliver and execute. 

Following news today, RedCat’s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat’s drones. 

They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options

TLDR: Drone warfare is here. American drone dominance is here. Plan to outpace China which means $$$$$ for drone industry. RedCat won SRR contract beating 30+ competitors for it. Meeting the supply demand for the contract. 
Has connections to current administration. Approved for NATO.

Genius Sports (GENI) – Equity Research Report

Rating: Buy | Price Target: $40/share

Company Overview
Genius Sports is a leading provider of official sports data, video, and media technology services. It operates in three segments: Betting Technology & Services, Media Technology & Services, and Sports Technology & Services. Its core business revolves around delivering low-latency, official data feeds, integrity solutions, and media/ad-tech solutions to sportsbooks, leagues, and advertisers.

Industry Structure: The Duopoly
The global sports data industry has consolidated into a duopoly between Genius Sports and Sportradar. Most top-tier leagues have signed official rights contracts with one of these two players.
This grants both companies pricing power, sticky multi-year contracts, and significant barriers to entry. Sportradar's acquisition of IMG Arena and Genius Sports' extended NFL exclusive rights through 2030 reinforce this structure.

Catalyst: December 3, 2025 Investor Day
On December 3, 2025, Genius Sports will host its Investor Day in New York City. The company will demonstrate its product suite, growth strategy, and financial outlook. Investors are expected to gain a clearer understanding of the depth, breadth, and strength of Genius’ rapidly growing Media segment, guided to grow at least 60% YoY in 2H-2025. The Investor Day will likely highlight product demos, fan intelligence capabilities (via the Sports Innovation Lab acquisition), and advertising integrations, which may catalyze investor confidence and support valuation re-rating.

Media Business Growth
Genius’ Media business, driven by FANHub, ad-tech integrations, and fan intelligence tools, is the fastest-growing part of the company. With ~60% YoY growth guided for H2-2025, management aims to establish Media as a core driver of margin expansion. This segment is expected to mature into a higher-margin, software-like business, improving Genius’ overall profitability profile.

Why Genius Sports and Sportradar Are the Visa & Mastercard of Sports Betting
• Two-Sided Networks: They connect leagues (rights owners) with sportsbooks/media operators,similar to how Visa/Mastercard connect merchants and cardholders.
• Mission-Critical Infrastructure: Official live data feeds are indispensable for in-play betting, just as cardrails are essential for commerce.
• Duopoly Resilience: Like Visa and Mastercard, two scaled networks coexist globally, ensuringredundancy and pricing balance.
• Embedded Growth: Both are layering new services (media, AI, video) like Visa/Mastercard layeredfraud prevention, cross-border fees, and loyalty.
• High Switching Costs: Sportsbooks cannot risk losing official feeds, echoing merchants’ dependenceon card networks.
Path to $40/share
GENI trades around $12.79 today. To reach $40 (~$10B equity value), the company must scale revenue from ~$645M in 2025 to ~$1.2–1.3B by 2027–2028, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to 25–30% or more. That would yield ~$350–$400M EBITDA. At a premium 25x EV/EBITDA multiple, supported by duopoly economics and rapid Media growth, GENI’s valuation aligns with $40/share.

Exhibit: GENI Share Price Bridge to $40

Risks
• Rights renewal risk: leagues may demand higher economics or switch providers.
• Ad-market cyclicality could slow Media growth if brand budgets decline.
• Competitive pressure from Sportradar or new entrants in specific markets.
• Regulatory risks affecting betting, advertising, or data usage.
Conclusion
Genius Sports and Sportradar stand as the two strongest business models in the global sports betting industry, analogous to Visa and Mastercard in payments. Both firms benefit from scale, rights exclusivity, and embedded network effects. With rapid Media growth, a clear duopoly, and the upcoming December 2025 Investor Day as a catalyst, we see GENI’s path to $40/share as realistic within 2–3 years. We assign a Buy rating with a $40/share price target.",24,35,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/qa3n1w0nhuqf1.jpeg,new,YOLO,0.8

People told me to size smarter and grab longer-dated calls on $IREN, so I did. Also added some $GLXY to the mix.

Postion Before:

10k CIFR Jan Options

**My positions now:**

* **$IREN – $48k** (main conviction play)
* **$CIFR – $13k**
* **$GLXY – $7k**

# Why I’m in:

* These names are perfectly positioned for the **AI + Bitcoin + Datacenter** melt-up.
* If even *one* of them lands a big hyperscaler contract (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, w.e), it’s an instant **2x+**.
* My bet is on **$IREN** leading the pack. They’re scaling fast, and the “AI miner pivot” narrative is just starting.

# The Setup:

We’re heading into year-end with **AI mania + BTC halving narrative + risk-on rally** all converging. Once this sector catches another bid, people are going to be chasing hard.

1nnr3mg,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 12:24:18,YOLO $600k+ speculation on MUX as Barrick M&A target,"Commodities like gold, silver, and uranium have the sex appeal for investors doing moon math on free cash flow from rising commodity prices. However, looking at the strategic focus of mining majors, they are in love with copper, especially supermassive, cheap copper porphyry deposits up in the Andes in newly liberalized Argentina. Case in point is the recent Teck+Anglo merger, a harbinger of M&A to come in the copper space.

Most of the juicy Andes copper deposits have been taken by the Lundin clan, but MUX has one remaining supermassive copper project in Los Azules. Doing napkin math on Los Azules economics at current copper prices gets a NPV that suggests MUX's Los Azules stake easily exceeds the enterprise value of MUX, not counting McEwen's substantial though mediocre gold mining operations.

https://preview.redd.it/fjp6nir5qqqf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb2c56e12b8146accf6099bcaa23e1c941cffa6

I see Barrick as most likely acquirer given their existing operations in the same San Juan province of Argentina, given their nearby Veladero JV with Shandong Gold. Most of their operational/regulatory know-how readily translates out to building Los Azules. In my eye, the Los Azules dream team would be Barrick as operator, and Shandong Gold/Rio Tinto/McEwen Mining as minority equity partners given operational, technological, and exploration expertise on the Los Azules geology. In my calculation, Barrick could plausibly build out Los Azules with fronting just a couple hundred million of project equity with these partners, writing a royalty to FNV/WPM, and taking reasonable levels of project debt.

The other potential operator is Rio Tinto who is already on the Los Azules cap table. While Rio has nearby Argentina operations, they are in the Salta province and their workforce/operational knowledge is less readily translatable to Los Azules.

MUX has a long-awaited technical report on Los Azules coming out next month. It has been delayed a couple times, and my read of the delays is that they are due to scope creep, i.e. positive surprises that necessitate further exploration/testing than originally envisioned. MUX has verbally indicated plans for an IPO of the stake and potentially building out the project themselves, but IMO this is just positioning/angling for stronger hand in M&A negotiations. Either way, once that technical report comes out, I believe the stock can move very quickly.

Wish me luck as I have a degenerately large portfolio fraction on this bet. I plan to hold options into year end and may trade in and out of shares.

**Disclaimer: This is purely my own speculation with no confirmations, my napkin math has been very wrong in the past. I am not an investment professional, this is not investment advice.**

* Skywater (SKYT) is a special company. It’s a US semiconductor manufacturer sitting at the intersection of two secular themes: (1) Domestic, trusted supply of US military chips, and (2) picks and shovels exposure to quantum computing.

**Core defense/specialty foundry (\~80% of revenue)**

* Skywater is one of 12 DMEA category 1-A trusted foundries certified to supply chips to the US DoD. For those of you too lazy to look up what that means, this is basically the Fort Knox of chip fabs, and it’s hard to get. Unlike peers embedded in large conglomerates (BAE, Raytheon, ON), **SKYT is one of the ONLY public pureplays on US military chip fabrication**.

**SKYT has two important facilities:**

* Florida advanced packaging: the DoD awarded SKYT $120mm (with options up to $190mm) to build this out. It is trusted & accredited and almost ready to start ramping. Outputs will be used in **drones, electronic warfare, guided munitions, and space avionics.**
* Austin fab: this was owned by Infineon and SKYT is acquiring it. It was not “trusted” before, but under Skywater, it will be. It previously specialized in industrial/auto end markets, but now will be eligible to supply chips for **drones, satellites, missiles, and comms gear.**

**Quantum & Photonics (\~20% of revenue)**

* Donald mentioned the word “quantum” 5 times in his speech with Starmer last week. The hype cycle is in full swing. And Skywater is the classic picks and shovels play.
* While every PhD with a powerpoint is burning through VC cash\*\*, Skywater is one of the only companies actually getting paid\*\*.  They provide essential foundry services and photonics platforms that quantum players need for their chips and devices. Management has called out double digit y/y growth, and if quantum really takes off, this business could hockey stick.

**Policy Tailwinds & Strategic Importance**

* The CEO, Thomas Sonderman, has been busy in Washington. Just earlier this month he was seen at the White House with top brass, including Michael Kratsios, the Chief Technology Officer of the United States. Kratsios is responsible for crafting the US quantum strategy (photos attached).
   * [Michael J.K Kratsios - Department of War Bio](https://www.war.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/2279091/michael-jk-kratsios/)
* SKYT is already in the club. They’re pre-vetted and pre-funded. Next up could be CHIPs grants, new DoD IDIQs/OTAs, and though a long shot, maybe even a direct government equity check.

**Why Now?**

* “Quantum” is getting publicity at the highest levels. Attention = budgets.
* SKYT’s Florida facility is nearly ready to ramp. This probably means some big DoD orders are on the way. They paid for it after all. 
* At today’s market cap, you’re buying a critical part of the US defense/quantum supply chain at a total bargain. 

**TLDR:** $SKYT is a tiny company with a license to print money from the Pentagon. They are one of the only pureplays building ""Made in the USA"" chips for the military. They are also the picks and shovels play for the quantum computing industry, collecting tolls from whoever wins. Technology. Skywater already has a seat at the table and is Chummy with DOD Pals.

1nmucye,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 11:05:40,The Federal Reserve’s Dual Mandate Is Outdated And The Data Used For Decisions Are Wrong. A Better Approach From Escorts.,"The Fed claims to balance price stability with maximum employment. In practice, both pillars are built on sand:

Job creation data is constantly revised downward... the latest BLS revision wiped out 911,000 jobs like a bad typo.

The unemployment rate is essentially fan fiction. It counts gig workers, Uber drivers, OnlyFans creators, and yes, technically even escorts, prostitutes, hookers, and strippers as “employed.”

Inflation at “3%” is a joke. My grocery bill, rent, and utilities all disagree.

The truth is, the economy runs on a far more honest set of forces: men’s disposable income to spend on sex work and women’s willingness to sell companionship.

So I propose a new, more accurate Dual Mandate for the Federal Reserve:

1. Balance the number of men who can still afford escorts, prostitutes, hookers, strippers, and sugar babies.

2. Balance the number of women entering sex work out of economic necessity.


Here’s the model:

Bad economy: More women enter the industry due to lack of alternatives while men cut back on spending

Good economy: Fewer women stay in sex work since they have better alternatives; men who can afford it spend more


Forget CPI. The true measure of inflation is the Escort Asking Rate Index (EARI™) a basket of advertised rates across cities. If her hourly goes up, it’s because her rent, groceries, and Uber rides went up. That’s a real-time, boots-on-the-ground measure of cost of living.

So if you want price stability and full employment? Look no further than the front page of Tryst and Seeking instead of opaque & confusing calculations done by economists

As a future Fed official, I’ll ensure every FOMC meeting includes a robust discussion of escort pricing trends before setting interest rates. Powell had his dot plot. I’ll have my thot plot.

1nm0a5q,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 10:54:22,Huge Micron Bet,"Hey everyone,

First time with a DD so forgive me if I sound regarded. 

This is the biggest trade I am set up for and wanted to share my thoughts. 

I believe we are going to see a huge run up next Tuesday with Microns earnings call. Current price is $162 with the pull back with Samsungs announcement spooking the market but I believe this won’t affect Microns future capabilities with HBM.  

So Micron Q4 earnings are coming up… and I’m bullish. I took up a huge position with the underlying prior to the pump on Thursday. 

Yesterday with the drop I loaded up at the bottom on 200 calls $175 expiring October 17. 

My logic is this. 

Seeing what happened with Oracle over their guidance gives me confident we may expect something crazy from Micron, especially when their customers Nvidia, Amd, Microsoft, Amazon, Google all had record years. All of them just crushed it on AI and cloud growth.

If they’re winning, Micron is too. Every GPU and every data center relies on Micron’s memory to run. While there are 2 main competitors in the memory landscape (Samsung and SK Hynix) I believe Micron is well positioned regardless. 

Last quarter: $9.3B in revenue with nearly 50% growth in high-bandwidth memory sales.

Next up: Management is guiding ~$10.7B for Q4 with stronger margins. I think they may beat expectations. 

In all of the last 5 reported fiscal quarters listed above, Micron has beaten EPS expectations.  ￼

The beat amounts range from ~+$0.13 to ~+$0.34 in recent quarters.

The most recent (Q3 FY2025) was the largest beat in that sample, +$0.34

However with this upcoming Q4 FY 2025, EPS consensus estimates are around $2.78-$2.86 per share. Year-over-year that’s a big jump from ~$1.18 in Q4 FY2024.  ￼
	
Gross margin expectations have been revised up, reflecting tight supply + improved pricing (especially DRAM).

Analyst Quotes & Price Targets

Wedbush (Matt Bryson) – PT $200

“Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson raised the firm’s price target on Micron Technology to $200 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm notes that demand from cloud service providers has come in stronger than expected, which could significantly boost Micron’s future sales and pricing power. Wedbush believes that the ongoing AI build-out is creating a structural uplift in demand for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory that will continue through 2026.” 【Barron’s】

Barclays – PT $175

“Barclays analysts raised their Micron target price to $175 from about $140, while maintaining an Overweight rating. The analysts acknowledged that some of the recent NAND chip orders coming out of Silicon Valley may be short-term in nature, but they believe Micron will likely exceed its current guidance. They also expect the company to offer a strong forward outlook as hyperscaler spending on AI infrastructure continues at an aggressive pace.” 【Barron’s】

Deutsche Bank (Melissa Weathers) – PT $175

“Deutsche Bank analyst Melissa Weathers lifted her price target on Micron shares from $155 to $175, reiterating a Buy rating. She noted that favorable market conditions for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory, particularly products tied to artificial intelligence data centers, are a major driver of upside. Weathers added that DRAM pricing has remained firm, supply is constrained, and demand for HBM in GPUs and servers is accelerating faster than the Street had anticipated.” 【Investors.com】

Mizuho (Vijay Rakesh) – PT $182

“Mizuho Securities raised its price target on Micron to $182 and kept a Buy rating. Analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote that momentum around artificial intelligence and strong demand for high-bandwidth memory should continue to drive Micron’s results higher. He cited tight supply in both DRAM and NAND, with pricing moving upward, as well as Micron’s increasing share of AI-focused products. Rakesh emphasized that Micron is one of the few companies positioned to deliver both volume growth and margin expansion in this environment.” 【MarketWatch】

UBS (Timothy Arcuri) – PT $185

“UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised Micron’s price target to $185 and reiterated a Buy rating. Arcuri pointed to confidence in DRAM and HBM supply tightness and sustained AI-related growth as the core reasons for the higher target. He noted that Micron’s technology roadmap has been executing well and that the company is positioned to capture outsized share of the high-performance memory demand wave driven by Nvidia, AMD, and hyperscalers.” 【PriceTargets.com】

Susquehanna – PT $200

“Susquehanna Financial upgraded its Micron target to $200, keeping a Positive rating. Analysts cited tightening DRAM and NAND supply, improving average selling prices across memory, and accelerating AI adoption as reasons to expect Micron’s earnings power to surprise to the upside. The firm believes current Street estimates remain too low given the structural tailwinds in AI-centric workloads.” 【PriceTargets.com】

JPMorgan (Harlan Sur) – PT $185

“JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised Micron’s price target to $185 from $160 and kept an Overweight rating. Sur highlighted upside to revenue, gross margin, and earnings in the near term, driven by better-than-expected pricing across multiple end-markets including AI data centers, smartphones, and personal computers. He said the company is likely to announce November-quarter guidance that comes in solidly ahead of consensus expectations. JPMorgan believes Micron’s HBM3E ramp and DRAM cost reductions are ahead of schedule, which will further support earnings acceleration.” 【Benzinga】

Rosenblatt Securities (Kevin Cassidy) – PT $200

“Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy reaffirmed a Buy rating on Micron and boosted the firm’s target to $200. Cassidy wrote that Micron could report a modest beat to its preannounced results, but the real story will be the outlook. He expects Micron’s November-quarter guidance may come in much higher than consensus estimates of $11.8 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.00. Cassidy emphasized that constrained DRAM and NAND Flash wafer supply through at least 2026, alongside accelerating demand from AI workloads, positions Micron for outsized profitability.” 【Benzinga】

Zacks Investment Research – Avg PT $155.59 (Range $75–$200)

“Zacks recently upgraded Micron from Hold to Strong Buy, giving the stock a Zacks Rank #1. Their analysts cite accelerating demand for DRAM and NAND, stronger-than-expected revenue in AI/data center markets, and consistent earnings surprises as the drivers. Zacks’ consensus 12-month price target from ~34 analysts is $155.59, with estimates ranging from as low as $75 to as high as $200. They highlight Micron’s strong Growth and Momentum scores, though its Value score is weaker given the higher multiples.” 【Zacks / MarketBeat】

Micron Management Quotes & Context

“Micron’s strong competitive position and solid execution delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, with revenue, gross margin and EPS all exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges.” — Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO.  ￼

“Data center revenue more than doubled year over year and reached a record level, and consumer-oriented markets had strong sequential growth.” — Mehrotra.  ￼
	
“We generated substantial free cash flow in the quarter, even as we continue to make strategic investments critical to sustain long term growth.” — Mehrotra.  ￼
	
“Micron delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, driven by all-time-high DRAM revenue including nearly 50% sequential growth in HBM revenue.” — Mehrotra.  ￼

“We are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025, while we invest to build on our leadership to address growing AI-driven memory demand.” — Mehrotra.  ￼

“Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $7.1 billion, up 51% year over year, and represented 76% of total revenue. Sequentially, DRAM revenue increased 15%, with bit shipments increasing over 20% and prices decreasing in the low single-digit percentage range, primarily due to a higher consumer-oriented revenue mix.” — Mark Murphy, CFO.  ￼

“NAND revenue was $2.2 billion … Sequentially, NAND revenue increased 16%, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-20s percentage range and prices decreasing in the high single-digit percentage range.” — Murphy.  ￼

“Gross margin … was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better prices for both DRAM and NAND, partially offset by a higher consumer-oriented mix.” — CFO Murphy.  ￼
	
“Ending inventory for fiscal Q3 was $8.7 billion, or 139 days. Inventory was down $280 million sequentially, and inventory days were down 19 days sequentially, driven by strong sequential bit shipment growth in both DRAM and NAND.” — Murphy.  ￼
	
Guidance for Q4:
“We expect revenue of $10.7 billion ± $300 million; gross margin non-GAAP of ~42% ± 1%; operating expenses approx $1.2 billion ± $20 million; non-GAAP EPS of ~$2.50 ± $0.15 per share.” — Micron management.  ￼

“With another quarter of shipment growth forecasted in fiscal Q4, we expect to exit fiscal 2025 with tight DRAM inventories, significantly reduced NAND inventories and overall company DIO near our target levels. With low inventories on hand and a constructive demand environment, we will continue to focus on improving pricing and further strengthening our product mix.” — Management.  ￼

TLDR

Best Case (Bullish)

Revenue: ~$11.2B+ (above top of guidance)

EPS: $2.90+ (beats revised $2.85 guide)

Gross Margin: 45%+ (tight supply + strong DRAM/HBM pricing)

Guidance: Raised again for FY2026, pointing to sustained AI/cloud demand
	
Stock Impact: Could rally +20–30%, pushing toward $180–$200 as analysts hike targets

Worst Case (Bearish)

Revenue: < $11.0B (below guide midpoint)

EPS: < $2.70 (miss vs Street ~$2.78–$2.85)

Margins: Slip toward 42–43% (pricing softness, higher costs)

Guidance: Conservative, signaling slower demand or inventory concerns

Stock Impact: Could drop −10–25%, retracing toward $120–$130

The biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up, I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular. 

Right now PE is ~24-25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit $10-12 for FY 2026, and PE drops to 18-20 we are still looking at $200+ price target. I believe $175-185 is a lower range.

Of course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise.

>EDIT:   
  
  
After Paramount CEO David Ellison's ""presumptive all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery,"" Puck's Dylan Byers has followed up to reveal that ""a well-placed Hollywood source called to suggest \[...\] that Netflix was also considering a bid for David Zaslav's \[WBD CEO and president\] assets.""

>Byers acknowledges that this scenario was once ""implausible,"" but that ""Ellison's seemingly limitless cash and ambition have accelerated Hollywood's consolidation process, and his decision to bid for all of WBD now—in an attempt to preempt potential rivals—is forcing nearly everyone to dust off their models.""

>These potential bids are coming after Warner Bros.' historic summer with a streak of successful movies at the box office. However, Puck reports that Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo ""does not expect WBD stock price to move much beyond $19 a share"" and that ""neither Apple nor Amazon will go for all of WBD.""

>Thinking along the lines that Netflix would be interested only in Warner Bros.' studio and streaming operations, Byers says: ""\[...\] as I discussed on Sunday, Zaz would need to convince his board and WBD shareholders that there would be more value coming from the split than from the Ellisons—that two in the bush is worth more than a bird in hand.""

>As far as what Paramount's possibly buying Warner Bros. means, the merging of two of Hollywood's oldest studios could result in a powerful new institution in the industry. Ellison seemingly wants to go all in on this idea, as his goal is to buy all of Warner Bros.' assets, including games, comics, and more. Netflix's offer might mean splitting up parts of the company.

TL:DR - they probably want to spin-off parts of WBD which may be a tougher sell to their shareholders than a huge bag of $ from the Ellisons for the whole thing.

Seems like Netflix is trying to take a final stab at grabbing part of WBD before they sell to PSKY. Ellisons offered $22-24/share, think some analysts were calling 21/share bullish so my take away is that the Ellisons seem likely to get this done.",298,96,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nlw4qk/netflix_to_bid_on_wbd/,new,News,0.9

Although this is a small percentage of my/my parents’ portfolio, it has surprisingly outperformed every other stock I bought.  Maybe because I didn’t time the other stocks well.

I think the argument for this is simple - gold offers protection against inflation while some other metals can be used for AI/data related infrastructures.  However, I’m not sure if its current price is too high.  While 60% is a good profit to take, I’m not too sure what else I would buy if do take profit so I’m thinking of holding a bit longer.

1nl8km0,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 12:39:52,Duolingo DD," Dear, Ladies, gentleman and degenerate market regards

I’ve been doing a deep dive into one particular public company called Duolingo. You might be saying “wtf the language learning app?”. Yes correct, that app with the green owl. A company can be selling dog food for all I care, but if the numbers and the narrative are good, I'm buying. That being said, Duolingo ($DUOL) is slowly presenting an amazing opportunity as the stock price continues to fall. Opportunities like this is how life changing wealth is made. When everyone is betting on the downfall, you take the other side of that trade and bet against them all. The risk to reward ratio on this is too good to ignore.

Would also like to mention, if you’re an ape who has been buying into the hype of palantir with a disgusting 600 PE ratio, so high that you might as well buy your local pizza shop thats makes 100k a year for 50 million, then duolingo should not be a problem for you to take a chance on.

**The Narrative**

The bubble has officially popped on Duolingo due to rising fears of competitors entering the market. The two main competitors as of right now are OPENAI, and the tech giant GOOGLE. People are discovering through OpenAi that you can create your own language learning game and are rumoring that people will no longer need duolingo. Google had also announced that they will be entering the language learning app space with google translator utilizing ai for live language conversion. Duolingo did also damage their PR by announcing they would be utilizing AI as well, which the public did not take lightly as they misunderstood it for replacing their employees with AI. Users also had reason to believe that AI will create poor quality content in comparison to having humans manually make the courses which may be true; however, if other companies are in the race utilizing AI for language learning, then Duolingo must compete. Those 3 narratives were enough to pop the bubble of duolingo as it has fallen from $542 to $282 as of today. Can the stock fall further? Yes it can, but it's one of those scenarios where you want it to.

The P/E ratio of Duolingo was over 300 at its peak on May 15th 2025. Yes the company was way overvalued at the time for a growth company, (a fair valuation for growth companies range between (40-80) however the company is consistently beating earnings expectations and their free cash flow continues to rise higher and higher. Today that P/E ratio has dropped to 122 and its price to sales ratio has dropped to 15:1. Yes those numbers still do seem high, but 

as their free cash flow continues to rise, that P/E ratio will drop into fair valuations. Understand that this company is growing on average 40% year over year. For those who don't understand, markets are always forward looking. The institutions and retail investors who are buying into this company are betting on the fact that the over valuation numbers will drop as they consistently report good earnings, revenue and forward guidance.

**The Bull Thesis**

So before being able to predict the future, you first need to look into the past where history doesn't always repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. Take a look at the success of Netflix. Even when Amazon, Apple, Disney and Google (youtube) entered the space of video streaming, people thought Netflix would be in serious trouble. In 2011, Amazon announced that they would offer Amazon prime video for free with their subscription; while at the same time Netflix decided to increase their prices by 60%. 

Customers were furious and Netflix lost over 800 000 subscribers in 1 quarter. This resulted in their Free cash flow dropping from 59 million in quarter 2 of 2011, to 15 million in quarter 3 of 2011. Eventually their free cash flow did fall into the negatives and recovered in 2013 (you can see how the stock follows that on the charts).

**The Moat**

There is no moat. Just branding. “How is this bullish?” Well lets think, what’s Spotify's moat? What about Netflix? Literally just branding is the moat, so people who think duolingo’s demise is due to a lack of a business moat are delusional. It’s like saying in the year 2000, “why would anyone buy into amazon when anyone can make a website and sell books?” fucking regards. 

**User Experience**

When you look at music streaming services, spotify ($SPOT) was the first to the game publicly. Eventually, Apple, Google (youtube), Amazon and about 20 other music streaming platforms nobody gives a fuck about had entered the game. Yet to this day, spotify is what’s most popular among them all taking 36% of the music streaming market. Why? User experience is the answer. The spotify platform itself is what carries them and separates them from the rest for both artists and customers. 

**The Brand**

The infamous green owl logo is famous across the world. Duolingo is a world wide icon for language learning. When people hear that “ding\* sound completing a duolingo game, everyone knows instantly that it's duolingo. When people ask about learning another language, they instantly point people in the direction of duolingo. It's literally the rank #13 app on the app store for apple and on the front page of “essential apps.”

	When people talk to each other about music they ask “what's you’re spotify?” Nobody asks whats your “apple music, amazon music or youtube music”

	When your wife’s boyfriend is asking her to come over and watch a movie, he says “netflix and chill” NOT “amazon prime, disney, or apple tv and chill?” the fuck?

I'm listing these examples, because they all have a subscription business model just like duolingo. That being said, duolingo’s subscription model is actually better than theirs.

**Business Model**

Ad revenue and subscriptions, that's it. People pay a yearly subscription for their ability to learn new languages which has been proven to be more effective and enjoyable than any other method through gamification. You got kids who are using this damn app in school, recommended by their teachers and you have parents buying it for their kids. Lets not forget that this company is now going to expand out of just language learning as they have included learning subjects like music, math and chess. 

Wait? Chess? Wtf? 

Yes that's exactly what I'm thinking, but if you look beyond that, Duolingo is expanding to hit the whole education market. Why pay for chess lessons from elsewhere when you can get it on duolingo with 100+ additional learning courses. Ideally, duolingo is expanding into a whole education platform, more directed towards the youth for everything. I wouldn't be surprised if they included courses like science, finance, health etc…

	They have utilized AI in addition to help the teachers/course makers create new courses at a very accelerated pace. Their first 100 courses took them 12 years. Now with AI, they are generating 153 new courses in 1 year.

	There is NO FRICTION.

* No governments/regulations trying to stop this
* No maintenance on their assets (courses)
* No real competition in user experience

All they have to do is create a great product (a course), add it into their catalog of other courses that comes with the subscription. The more they add, the more incentive there is to go with duolingo instead of buying learning programs elsewhere.

**The Bear Thesis**

Go fuck yourself?

On a serious note, looking at Google live translation app which they offer for free; it does seem to be very reliable, but strictly for translating. They claim to be offering language learning practice tools on their google translate app which would be free. Not to mention, there are already over 1 billion downloads of google translate. Comparing it to Duolingo, yes both of them are free, however; google has not announced whether they would  put a pay wall behind learning/using their practice tool. However what google is missing in comparison to Duolingo secret formula of success would be gamification. 

If the companies continues to show slower growth, or continues to show a decline in active user for the few quarters; well then, we’re fucked. But as of right now, the decline in free cash flow from last quarter to this isn’t ""catastrophic,"" but rather a typical overreaction to the narrative. 

**External Risks**

Rising interest rates. Lets be real, trump is calling for lower interest rates but obviously Jerome Powell doesn't want to follow through with it. In the long term event that they can’t afford to lower rates but rather might  increase rates; the broad market does face the risk of a downturn just like in 2022-2023, which of course would most likely add more downward pressure to the stock and market as a whole.

Another external risk that may present itself is a massive bull market in gold, and extreme volatility in government bond markets, more specifically the 10 year yield bonds. For those who don't understand, a massive bull market in gold has always signaled warning signs that something is about to break in the financial system, because gold has always been considered the safe haven asset. Extreme volatility in bond markets signal panic when the yields spread too far apart from the benchmark rate of the federal reserve, which stands at 4.25 as of right now.

Free cash flow = cash from operations - capital expenditures.

Notice how their free cash flow keeps on rising? Notice how free cash flow has dropped in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025? That small decline in free cash flow, paired with the narrative of the company's demise in the future has resulted in a crash from $542 to $282. Let me tell you right now, if this company reports an increase in free cash flow in the next few earnings calls; Not only can the narrative change from negative to positive, this stock can very well turn around and go bullish very fast. 

**The Numbers (QUARTER OVER QUARTER) (2024/2025)**

|Free cash flow|$53.7|$86.3|**61%**|
|Free cash flow margin|30.1%|34.2%|\~4 pts|

The stock price of Duolingo hovering at $270 is basically assuming the company’s growth over the next 5 years would only be at about 25%. If you take a look at the numbers above, the only thing that's under 25% are the monthly active users. The Company is projecting on its forward guidance about 35% YoY growth; which means the stock price is falling towards undervalued territory. The company has been growing at about 45% annually over the past 5 years, so yes a 35% growth on forward guidance does signal a decline in growth. But if you want to take the contrarian approach to the company, believing that AI will accelerate the growth of the company and Google means fuck all; this would be an amazing buying opportunity. 

P.S -This is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor. This is just my opinion on my projections of this company's stock price. If you buy high, panic, then sell low, too bad, sucks for you. Would recommend buying and holding the stock as we don't know how long this negative narrative will play out. (maybe **WRITING** covered calls OTM for a passive income) If you're a regard and you choose to gamble your life savings **Buying** OTM call options, good luck.

1nl4gc6,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 10:03:22,US DOE launches Speed to Power initiative to meet rising demand,"*The U.S. Department of Energy has launched the Speed to Power initiative to accelerate large-scale generation and transmission projects that can support the country’s rising energy needs. The DOE argues that current project development is moving too slowly to meet the demands of reindustrialization and the growing manufacturing base, as well as the surging load from artificial intelligence and data centers. By working with stakeholders, the department aims to identify projects that can deliver power reliably while addressing the challenges of today’s grid.*

*Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will need much more energy in the years ahead and emphasized that, under President Trump’s leadership, the DOE intends to ensure this demand can be met with affordable, reliable, and secure energy. The Speed to Power initiative is designed to harness private-sector expertise and expand the use of all viable energy sources so the United States can remain competitive in the global AI race.*

*The first step is a request for information to collect input on large-scale projects, including both generation and transmission. The program builds on Trump’s first-day executive order declaring a National Energy Emergency, which called for an urgent expansion of energy infrastructure to strengthen both national and economic security.*

*In connection with that order, the DOE released a report on grid reliability and security that sets a standard methodology to identify regions most at risk and guide interventions.

1nl4g6m,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 10:03:11,$TTD DD: The Tendie Desk,"If you’ve seen my last couple posts I’ve been pretty good at picking stocks near the bottom before a bull run. CRDO, NBIS, ENTG, GLXY and most recently MNDY which I did a DD on. The problem is I’m a regard and mismanaged all of them for a loss except MNDY, but I’m rolling those gains into what I present before you today: $TTD. 

TTD is an ad tech company that has received a series of aggressive prison beatings in the market on its way to becoming S&P 500’s worst performing stock of 2025. They act as the Don Draper of advertising, so if you’re a company that wants to advertise on platforms outside of the walled gardens you don’t call each company individually you call TTD and they help you find the best spots for your money across the channels they have access to. Most of TTD’s slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn’t have access to youtube, prime video and ig.

[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)

They aren’t taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying “we’re undervalued” or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don’t care either way because I think they’ll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. 

The DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said “TTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market”. Well I’m putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green’s imaginings.

Final considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix.

1nkow7c,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 20:19:37,[GAP]PING UP,"Alright, listen up you degenerates - while everyone is fomo-ing over AI, Semiconductors, Opendoor & New/Old-age tech memes - there's some real $$ to be made on some lesser focused, social arbitrage, value plays that have real potential to make 20, 30, 40%+ moves. I don't know where the rest of them are, but I'm talking about $GAP. This is a weird one but hear me out and look at my dd and let me know if I'm regarded.  
  
So why **$GAP?** I first thought about $GAP after $AEO's most recent earnings, where they shot up 40%+ after hours on results. This got me interested because the headlines for the earnings move were ""Sydney Sweeney"" related and the controversy her campaign generated, which translated into billions of impressions and many new customers. For anyone not on social media, $GAP capitalized on $AEO's controversy with their own denim ad in collaboration with KATSEYE - a global girl group which had recently been gaining insane traction with their own Netflix show, performances, and viral songs (Gnarly, Gabriela, etc.). The $GAP Denim ad went mega-viral across all social media and spawned videos everywhere of everyone replicating the dance in Denim - free advertising for $GAP. At this point, it's just an idea - so let's do some digging:  
  
**WHY DID AEO SURGE AFTER EARNINGS?**

To better understand the potential value $GAP - I wanted to better understand what made $AEO move so much after earnings. Here's what I found:

* Better than expected earnings, EPS $0.45 v $0.20 – 125% surprise beat and 15% YoY increase. They were beaten down after pulling their initial guidance, causing major uncertainty amongst investors.

* Revenue at $1.28B – beat expectations by 4.07%. Revenue was flat compared to prior year but still beat expectations and profitability surprise drove the run-up.

* Share buyback program YTD has reduced outstanding diluted shares by 10%, which contributed to increased EPS.

* Successful Marketing campaign wins in collaboration with Sydney Sweeney & Travis Kelce. According to the earnings call – 40 billion impressions, 700k new customer count, selling out of Sydney’s labeled AE products.

* Cost control which contributed to surprise EPS beat – SG&A down from last year & lower promotional activity.

* Optimistic commentary from management – they noted that they saw “nice upticks” in the AE business in Q3 – signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook – coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline). The revenues remained flat this quarter, which was surprising from how they talked about the success of their campaign, but this was explained by some of their core products being laggers (shorts). The lag was offset by the influx of new customers via the Sydney Sweeney ads.

* They noted that they saw “nice upticks” in the AE business in Q3 – signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook – coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline) 

They were also at a depressed valuation, especially after their poor Q1 Results, with P/E hovering between 9x-11x months after their Q1 earnings and before Q2 earnings. Understandable as the CEO also pulled their guidance for the year, which was a big red flag.

They are now trading at a TTM P/E of 18, and forward earnings above 14+ (I keep getting different estimate numbers, but it seems estimates are being repriced). A bit high in my opinion for a retail brand that hasn't shown stable, consistent growth - *but also not entirely unreasonable* \- and they are coming in with a more positive outlook. The markets are hungry for equities and multiples on average are higher.

They did also have relatively high short interest at \~18% before earnings, which likely also contributed to the sustained price movement upwards with shorts covering their positions. The last short interest data I looked at was on Fintel from 8/29/25 - right before their earnings. Once 9/15/25 data comes out, could validate this assumption.

Overall, the huge run-up doesn't seem to be completely ridiculous. The stock was at depressed valuations with a lot of negativity priced in. Earnings came at a huge beat, hugely successful ad campaign, and upbeat outlook from management. The price is now at an elevated multiple (maybe a little higher than it deserves, but only time will tell), but is not out of the normal for where AEO has traded historically and is not absolutely farfetched (look below:)

https://preview.redd.it/n7w09xaxk0qf1.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=359535c2340cbffd059ce947d3cf5aca44b39d02

**NOW THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY AEO MOVED THE WAY IT DID, WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT GAP?**  
  
First - I looked more into $GAP as a business. They’re much larger than AEO, generating nearly 3-4x their revenues. They also have a larger reach globally – operating in 40 + countries. They also include multiple brands under their umbrella – GAP, Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta. The big driver for GAP is their attempt to reinvigorate their brand, which has been showing slightly positive results in 3/4 brands over the past few quarters.  
  
I wouldn’t say their plan has yielded anything overly positive - UNTIL their most recent KATSEYE ad. For those of you that are unaware, it has gone insanely viral – similarly to the Sydney Sweeney ad, which is when I began looking into the stock for a potential beat / revised outlook on the brand. GAP collaborated with KATSEYE, which is a multicultural POP girl group that has been growing significantly in popularity with the younger demographic.

Their collab has already reached over 100M views on tiktok – just the main video alone (when I first checked, it was at 90M - then 2 days later, it was over 100M). People have been remaking, stitching, re-uploading the ad and those videos have also hit many millions of views (some individual video remakes have hit 40M+ views themselves, and I’m sure I probably haven’t seen all of them). IG has over 60M views ,Youtube has over 20M+ views, the shorts video has 5M+ views.

If we compare that to $AEO's Sweeny campaign, GAP has vastly outperformed in viewership (and probably engagement) across all platforms. $AEO also did pull the main ad off their social media and the supporting ads are also in the multi-millions of views, but they still don't compare to what $GAP has done in a shorter period of time.

\***Note: I did this research last week so the numbers may have shifted higher. Just checking tiktok & IG alone - the main video alone is now at 133M views on TT and \~70M views on IG.**

GAP's vids on tiktok previously were only hitting anywhere between 10-100k views. I think the more recent ones that were towards the top left gained traction as they were closer to the actual ad debut - being brought up by the launch of the ad itself. When a video goes mega viral on a page, it typically lifts the views of the other videos as well.

There are also endless video remakes tagging $GAP & Katseye hitting insane numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/jogcin72l0qf1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2504e259f6010f5ea29b1ba1dea4d7cad3572cc6

The ad became the most searched query on tiktok and was also mentioned on GAP’s earnings in late August. The CEO stated they reached over 8 billion impressions, which I believe was probably **understated** as it was likely gathered before the actual date of the earnings for the CEO's interview on Mad Money.

***NOTE - earnings came out 9 days after the ad was released and the Q2 earnings were reporting figures from August 2nd, 2025 - before the ad was released.***

**GAP HAD AN AMAZING AD, WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GAP'S UPCOMING NUMBERS?**

If we look at total sales as of FY 2024, GAP was about 22% of their sales (3.3b/15.1b). I couldn’t find the sales mix numbers on how much Denim they sell annually, but according to ChatGPT – the expectation is that they sell between 10-20% of their revenues in Jeans. At a midpoint, we can extrapolate that GAP sells approximately $400-$500M annually in denim – which I think is reasonable assumption.

Retail typically does not perfectly sell through all of their items, and GAP is not to be excluded from this observation. They'll likely have much more denim to sell beyond what they typically do, and in preparation for a large ad campaign - retailers often adjust inventory for this.

Since it's not easy to find concrete figures online about sales mix - let's use $AEO's earnings as an example to potentially gauge the impact the Katseye ad will have on $GAP. Quote from the earnings transcript ***""Sweeny Signature jeans sold out within a week and some products within 1 day. Demand for her curated online shop of Syd's Picks has been very strong.""***

Prior to their Q2 Earnings - Zacks' consensus estimate for AEO's earnings was $1.23b (about a 5-6% decline from the prior year), while their actual revenue was $1.28b (representing a \~1% decline YoY). This was a beat on revenue expectations of \~$50M. The decline expectations seemed in line with their Q1 report, which was quite depressing. The CEO spoke of all the new customers / eyeballs they got, how they plan on retaining and converting more of these new customers, and had an upbeat outlook going into the second half of the year.

So how can we think about this with GAP? The Ads are clearly different, but I believe GAP's strategic timing and content leveraged the controversy AEO created to boost their own campaign - **and it worked amazingly**. Aside from the screenshots shown above, IG has over 60M views, YouTube has over 20M views, and 5M views on YouTube Shorts - all platforms the Katseye GAP campaign has garnered more views & engagement while being up for a shorter duration of time.

According to GAP’s earnings call, their outlook is to grow Q3 at 1.5-2.5%. At 2%, this would mean an increase in sales of \~$72 million from Q3 2024. GAP had been teetering between decline and flat revenues in the past few years but has seen slight improvements in revenue growth due to their “reinvigoration” efforts **BEFORE the KATSEYE ad** brought on an insane number of impressions to their business.  
  
Now after the Ad, it's blown any of their campaigns thus far out of the water - with reception from the Ad being overwhelmingly positive and garnered even more support as it’s been touted as “the right way” to do an Ad in comparison to AEO’s campaign. The ad itself is just much easier to talk about and spread in younger circles - what kids / young adults are going to be talking about Sydney's AE monologue over the dance and catchy song from GAP?

I believe their outlook (1.5-2.5% Q3 revenue growth) **does not meaningfully include the impact from the campaign becoming mega viral** as GAP had already been growing at similar rates in other quarters (2% increase YoY last Q3 and beat expectations by 2.5%, and similar to the past few quarters). This makes sense to me as well since the campaign launched only a week before the Earnings call.

From glancing at their website and using LLMs – their denim products seem to average near $60 (they run sales / promotions often). Assume they sell $450M annually at an average $60 price point per item - that’s about 625,000 pieces of denim they sell monthly on a regular basis.  
  
Knowing they typically have excess inventory and that this was a large campaign, let's assume a similar number of new customers come to GAP as AEO (personally, I think GAP's campaign will probably be more effective, but won't know 'til Q3). On 700,000 new customers, I think it's a conservative guess to say a million additional items will be sold (about 1.4\~items per new customer), which would translate to about $60M in additional revenue. That alone would be about an additional 1% of revenue. If we assume less conservatively, we could see an additional 1.5-3% beat on top line revenue on their Q3 estimates.

Here are a few reasons why I think they may sell more than a million additional pieces:

* A segment of shoppers that will have purchased additional items outside of the KATSEYE specific products just from browsing the page / walking through the store and seeing other things they may like.

* Shoppers that bought multiple pieces / whole outfit sets – we can see this just scrolling through something like Tiktok.

* The KATSEYE ad being on trend with younger consumers (catchy song, lyrics that are directly comparing themselves to AE and using it to their favor, easy to learn dance) and women/girls – who are the primary target demographic, and this influencing them towards a brand. Even sororities are using it for rush videos, doing the dance in Denim, gaining tens of millions of views, and tagging GAP.

* The videos seemingly performing better in a shorter time frame. In the past 2 days I’ve checked (These are not the latest numbers, I checked a few days ago, they are likely higher now): \*\***NOTE - this is from last week and checking today on 9/18 on just TT & IG quickly, the views have continued to ramp up**

   * Tiktok’s original GAP ad has already gained +10M views, reaching over 100M views now. AE’s main ad was pulled from their pages, but the remaining ads have around 2-8M views. GAP has supporting ads that have outperformed AE’s best ads.

   * Instagram’s original GAP ad gained +5M views, with over 60M views now. AE’s main ad was pulled, and the top residual ad has 12M views.

   * Youtube’s Video is at 20M views, shorts at 5M views. AE’s remaining ad has 8.8M views and 2.4M views on shorts.

* Q3-Q4 is historically stronger for GAP and retail overall

I also went on GAP and clicked into some of their Denim items and put in a Manhattan (10002) / California Zip code (90001), which gave me 40 GAP locations each, both areas were **out of stock for the products in store.** Earlier in the week, the shipping was **also out of stock**, but it seems it is once again available. I tried clicking multiple sizes, colors, and fit combinations – and they all showed up as sold out in store. A lot of them were still not available online, though it does look like they restocked a bit. I also checked other zip codes like 73301 (Texas) and 60007 (Chicago). I did not have the patience to check all the products / zip codes in the world, but I saw enough that convinced me they are likely selling through the KATSEYE collab items. The first ones I found that were in stock was a “Crop Tank Top”, which you’d have to scroll down to find – but seems like the denim items have been majorly successful.

With a potential revenue beat, and similar renewed optimistic outlook off the back of a wildly successful ad campaign that's even being studied in college marketing classes - it's a recipe for a nice turnaround retail story - the one GAP's been trying to tell for the past few quarters.

**GAP'S VALUATION & PRICE TARGET**

Like AEO before the Sweeney pump - GAP is trading under a 10 P/E and forward earnings of under \~11.5. This gives them **room to move** from both an EPS beat, and a multiple re-rating (similar to what we saw with AEO).

GAP has consistently beat EPS (past 10 or so quarters), meaning management has been diligent about costs / been much more conservative in their guidance.

Based on the current TTM earnings (2.34), a 12x P/E ratio would bring GAP stock up to \~$28. Average analysts forward estimates (\~2.07), a 12x P/E ratio would bring it to $24.84.  
  
Now this is not much upside on the stock, but as we have seen before - GAP has been consistently **beat** earnings expectations and being roughly on target with revenue expectations. **With the ad campaign, I'm expecting a revenue beat, which should help with an earnings beat** **(which I would have expected regardless of the ad campaign as stated above), meaning the $24.84 price target is unlikely and is not my target for the stock.**  
  
Then, if we consider that the stock may rerate based on a more positive outlook and that the P/E is already very low - we could very reasonably see a 13-15x P/E.

* At a 2.34 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $30.42 and 15x P/E would be $35.1

* At a 2.07 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $26.91 and 15x P/E would be $31.05

* Assume the forward earnings estimate beat by 5% (conservative beat) - that's a 2.17 EPS, a 13x P/E is **$28.21** and 15x P/E would be **$32.55**

I'm not delusional - I understand that this is a retail company that's been stagnant over the years - but stocks move when the future of a company looks better than expected. The valuation is low, expectations aren't out of the world, & a decent amount of shares short which may have to cover - which is great for a potential beat and subsequent stock price move.

**If sales and overall outlook improve off the KATSEYE campaign and they continue to beat EPS estimates like they have (boosted by an increase in sales) I would say a $28 price target is realistically achievable and good odds landing somewhere between $30-32.**

*TLDR:*

*- $GAP is trading at low valuations with low expectations and decent short interest, leaving less room for downside and more room for upside.*

*- They have an insanely successful ad campaign running currently for Q3, which has arguably outperformed $AEO's campaign. $AEO's campaign contributed to the stock moving 40% after earnings and had a similar valuation / expectation as $GAP now.*

My current position - may add more leaps:

Old people aren’t going away, so demand is steady. Reposting because mods removed my earlier post for 0 reason?

* They’ve missed a pile of SEC filings (Q3 2024, FY 2024 10-K, Q1 and Q2 2025). Despite this, NYSE is letting them keep trading.
* Lenders (Truist Bank and Omega) agreed to forbearance instead of forcing default. That usually means lenders think there’s value to preserve. Default was from technicality (PACS triggered “technical defaults” because of problems tied to its warrants and its compliance certificates to lenders, the warrant certificates provided to lenders were deemed “defective” or “incorrect"" most likely due to the audit progress), not because they are out of money or something.
* Stock is trading around $12 while analyst price targets are $30+. If filings get cleared, re-rate potential is big.
* Upside play is a recovery to $20–30 if they get current on filings. Minimum. **ATH was $43 in Q3 2024** before the Hindenburg short report which has not been proven right to this day. Was easily on track for $50/share+ by end of 2024, after IPO in April for $21 a share.
* Additionally, **the NYSE has also been repeatedly granting them extensions**, up until the final, November 19th 2025 deadline. This is **bullish** because the exchange would've frozen/kicked them out long ago if they were not showing reasonable progress on filing the delinquent filings.
* From their CEO in their latest investor relations release: *Based on our progress, when we become current in our SEC filings, we expect to report record revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of 2025. We look forward to the Audit Committee completing its investigation as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities ahead to accelerate growth and drive value creation for all stakeholders.”*
* Their VERY SIMILAR competitor, who is slightly bigger, $ENSG, is trading at $160+ per share. This is incredibly undervalued, think of it as a very discounted version of $ENSG.

**What this boomer factory actually does**

PACS is a holding company investing in post-acute healthcare. Operations are decentralized: independent subsidiaries run the facilities day-to-day; corporate allocates capital, growth, and ops support. Current footprint: \~315 post-acute facilities across 17 states serving nearly 30k patients daily. The demand driver is demographics and acuity, not vibes.

Stock has been hammered and down since November 2024 where they were accused of fraud by a Hindenburg short report. Allegations have not been proven true to this day thus far. Company has been working with their independent auditors and possibly the government behind-the-scenes since then.

**NEW, latest updates in the past week with actual information:**

* Final NYSE extension granted for all delinquent filings, due November 19th 2025.
* Chief Financial Officer resigned (due to an investigation where he accepted high-value items from business partners), interim Chief Financial Officer appointed, Mark H. who is a co-founder and was previously the Chief Financial Officer from 2013 to Jan 1st. 2024.
* PACS announced in a [press release last week](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/pacs-group-announces-nyse-listing-extension-and-provides-select-preliminary-interim-operating-metrics) preliminary operating metrics
   * Portfolio size: As of June 30, 2025, PACS operates **316 health care facilities** in **17 states**, with **32,208 skilled nursing beds** and **2,419 assisted living beds**. That’s up by 96 facilities since Q2 2024, most added in second half of last year. [PACS Group, Inc.](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/pacs-group-announces-nyse-listing-extension-and-provides-select-preliminary-interim-operating-metrics)
   * CMS Rating Quality: 179 of their skilled nursing facilities (about **64.6%**) have earned a **4 or 5 Star CMS QM rating**. That’s a decent signal on quality. [PACS Group, Inc.](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/pacs-group-announces-nyse-listing-extension-and-provides-select-preliminary-interim-operating-metrics)
   * Occupancy: Total facility occupancy is **88.9%**, well above the industry average (\~78%). Breaking that out:
   * Ramping facilities are at **86.3%**
   * Mature facilities are at **95.1%** [PACS Group, Inc.](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/pacs-group-announces-nyse-listing-extension-and-provides-select-preliminary-interim-operating-metrics)
   * Skilled Mix: The percent of care that comes from skilled services (which generally pay better / drive margins) is \~**23.3%** in ramping facilities, \~**34.1%** in mature ones. [PACS Group, Inc.](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/pacs-group-announces-nyse-listing-extension-and-provides-select-preliminary-interim-operating-metrics)
   * Cash Position: PACS had **$294.2 million** in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025, up from **$157.7 million** on December 31, 2024. That gives them breathing room, assuming burn + capital needs are managed. [PACS Group, Inc.](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/pacs-group-announces-nyse-listing-extension-and-provides-select-preliminary-interim-operating-metrics)
* **Interim Chief Compliance Officer, Kathy Lauer**, recently hired gun who has a decorated career in the field of healthcare compliance, regulations, and working out deals with the government: *“I am deeply impressed by the urgency and commitment of the PACS team in its efforts to enhance compliance processes for the Company’s current phase of growth and development,” said Kathy Lauer, PACS’s Interim Chief Compliance Officer. “For many years, I have worked with highly regulated healthcare companies to improve their compliance and controls. I am confident that the PACS team is taking the right steps to best position the Company for the benefit of all stakeholders.”*

It's becoming increasingly clear that they intend to file and they have been operating their business successfully during this long independent audit journey, along with implementing new safeguards and processes so that there are no issues going forward. Market seems to like this, the stock has been climbing up daily since these recent statements, after reaching it's all-time low.

It's not too late to hop on board the spaceship. Not financial advice. I don’t know you, your account size, or your pain tolerance. Read the filings, watch the calendar, check EDGAR for official filings of delinquent earnings ahead of the November 19th deadline.

The company priced its shares to raise about $908 million, reflecting strong investor appetite for cloud security as enterprises continue shifting workloads away from traditional data centers.

Founded in 2012, Netskope built its reputation in cloud security, secure access service edge (SASE), and zero trust, markets forecasted to grow rapidly as businesses adapt to hybrid work and remote-first models. The IPO positions Netskope among top public cybersecurity players like Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks.

The public debut is seen as both a validation of Netskope’s technology and a broader signal that investor confidence in cybersecurity remains strong despite volatility in tech IPO markets. Analysts note that Netskope will now face the challenge of balancing rapid growth with public market scrutiny.

\---

I bought 1k leaps yesterday, upped to 3k after high level interactions with chat, and today rolled half my 7c's into 10c's. This one is incredibly undervalued imo. Some rough numbers

\---

\- 480,000,000 daily active users & \~932,000,000 monthly active users

\- 7% growth in MAU since last year

\- **over 5 billion Snaps are created every day** as of late 2024. IE: the average DAU sends off more than 10 snaps every day.

\- Many users have streaks exceeding 1000 days, users are sticky

\- The target audience is mostly teenagers. As per GPT: ""The platform is particularly popular with younger demographics, reaching about 90% of 13- to 24-year-olds""

\- Still super relevant, mostly seemed ignored / not on anyones radar (literally 5% of people on earth use it daily tho). I suspect this is because the primary users are the younger demographic -- ie: most people 30+ I know are not using it.

\- Valued \~$20 - 30 / daily active user.

\- With a streak of 1000+ days, if each \*DAILY\* user is worth 2c / day, it's undervalued on that alone. That's like a single ad. As per above each daily user sends on average 10 snaps a day. I'm sure they can figure out a way to make more than 2c from this. You can probably get \~2 targeted ads be per person per day, assuming 10 snaps. I think it's gotta be worth more than 2c

\- Valued at $10 two months ago and was trading over $12 earlier this year.

\- Price dumped due to bug in advertising platform last quarter. It made all the revenues look \*really\* bad, so everyone dumped / panicked without looking at larger picture.

\- Positive feedback from advertisers (ie: they enjoy the experience / working with snap): https://parameter.io/snap-stock-rises-3-following-tiktok-ban-delay-and-positive-advertiser-reviews/)

\- Reinvesting heavily into their own business & still growing

\- Trading at an all time low despite all the rest

\- Some more due diligence in my other post from yesterday:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1njeymd/snap\_chats\_in\_im\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1njeymd/snap_chats_in_im_in/)

\---

Chat - why is this regarded? Why am I regarded? IMO this is easily over $10 by EOY. Change my view. DYOR

\---

Update:

To everyone saying ""SNAP IS DEAD""... you are so incredibly wrong. Snap is growing - quite quickly. It's actually (quite literally) \~20-30m DAU's from passing insta's DAU's. Users spend \~80b hours on the app per annum, vs \~100b hours on insta. To everyone saying they have never been able to make a profit & never will be able to - people said the same thing about reddit. Then they changed how ads are in the platform and it rocketed straight up. Snap has a ton of potential IMO -- they already solved the hard problems (make an app people / especially teenagers actually want to use)

China cut off all antimony flows — first with September ’24 export controls and then a full ban to the US on Dec 3, 2024 — which choked supply to the West and prices soared. Europe has seen shipments freeze, and buyers are scrambling for non-China supply. It's important for ammo, solar glass, batteries, and IR/defense gear, and right now there is little supply for the West. 

That’s where $UAMY comes in. The only primary/significant antimony smelter in the US. It's processed in Thompson Falls, Montana, and the US is still \~80% import-reliant for antimony. Now that China’s sale to the US is gone, the domestic smelter has a US-processing monopoly. 

The kicker: antimony often rides shotgun with gold (stibnite). Perpetua’s Stibnite Gold Project in Idaho has \~148M pounds of antimony reserves and says it could cover \~35% of US demand in its early years — and DoD just threw more money at building a fully domestic antimony trisulfide supply chain. Perpetua and UAMY are working together on metallogical testing, setting up the “gold mine byproduct to U.S. smelter” pipeline the Pentagon wants. If that matures, UAMY owns the furnace.

1nk9po1,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 10:24:28,Just hit £500k - ALL IN ON HUT 8,"**Short background on my investing journey**

Started investing June 2020 with £15k. Through pure dumb luck I’ve turned it into £500k. Started off just copy trading anything that was pumping on here. First big score was $NIO at $11, sold at $50. Then followed a popular poster in here at the time, SirJackalot into a certain banned meme stock and came out with £300k.

Thought I was a genius, made life changing money doing all the wrong things, so I proceeded to nearly throw it all away losing money on every garbage piece of shit you guys shilled me. Wish, Baba, RKT, Palantir (yeah I even managed to lose on PLTR), CLF, every weed stock, you name it, I bag held it.

Went all in AMD (Hence the name) for 2 years of sideways pain, finally sold with a tiny gain. Which leads me to my current play HUT 8. Loaded up when market cap dropped below their BTC holdings after a short report in early 2024.

**HUT 8**

**AI/HPC Pivot**

Bitcoin mining is a dying business. Due to the halving, profits are halved every 4 years. Many bitcoin miners are pivoting to hosting AI HPC data centres, which provide more reliable sources of revenue. Even miners like Cleanspark who marketed themselves as 'The last pure play bitcoin miner' are discussing pivoting. These miners have been quietly scooping up cheap power for years and I believe this is not fully priced in and there is a lot of money to be made.

HUT 8 recently announced plans to develop four new sites across the US. Including a 1000MW data centre in Texas and a 300 MW called RiverBend in Louisiana which will be upgrading to 1000MW. Stage 1 for the Riverbend site is expected to be completed by Q4 2025. Therefore I believe an announcement for a deal with a hyper scaler is imminent.

HUT has a huge power pipeline of 10,800MW with 3100 MW capacity under exclusivity and 7700 Capacity under diligence.

**Bitcoin mining carveout (Creation of American Bitcoin)**

HUT 8 has gone into partnership with the Trump brothers Eric and Don Jr to create American Bitcoin ($ABTC). HUT 8 gave away all of their miners for an 80% stake in the company. HUT 8 has pretty much given away 20% of its miners for the Trump brand. Why would they do this? Like it or not the Trump name carries premium. The most expensive stock on the market is $DJT. $DJT is sitting at a $5B market cap despite only doing $1.3m in revenue so far this year. This is by far the most overvalued company on the stock market IMO. ABTC did a private raise worth $220m bringing in the Winklevoss twins which diluted HUT 8's share from 80% to 64% which puts the value at the time of the private raise just north of $1B. They then used the cash raised to upgrade their EH/s from 10 to 24.2.

ABTC has currently been public 2 weeks and as I currently sit here $ABTC is currently trading at $7.82 which puts the market cap at $7.1B and values HUT 8's 64% share at $4.5B despite HUT 8's Market cap being $4B itself while also holding 10k Bitcoin worth $1.2B on the balance sheet. ABTC is set up to be self funded and will be able to raise cash at absurd levels compared to what HUT 8 previously could without the Trump brothers while not diluting HUT 8 shares. I love this because I am extremely bullish on the AI HPC/ Energy Infrastructure side of the business and I don't want to be diluted to fund EH/s growth or the straight purchase of Bitcoin.",202,100,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nk9po1,new,YOLO,0.92

1nk5cl8,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 07:10:18,HUGE Deal Between $INTC and $NVDA,"NVIDIA and Intel announced a multi-generation collaboration across PC and datacenter and NVIDIA will invest $5B in Intel at $23.28 per share. The joint solution will be a tight coupling Intel x86 CPUs and NVIDIA RTX GPUs over NVLink for PCs and data-center platforms. Timeframe are TBD and current roadmaps with arm will not change, per sources, meaning NVIDIA will offer both.
 
Overall
 
•PCs: Intel will build and sell x86 SoCs integrating NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets
•Data center: Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA integrates into its AI platforms
•Financial: NVIDIA is committing $5B to Intel equity at $23.28/share
•Scope: Product collaboration—not a foundry manufacturing deal
 
Why it matters
 
•Windows/x86 PCs: Higher-bandwidth, lower-latency CPU-GPU coupling should lift AI inference and pro-app and gaming performance versus discrete PCIe designs. Data center: NVIDIA gains an x86 option alongside ARM; Intel attaches CPUs into NVIDIA’s fastest-growing AI platforms.
 
What we don’t know yet
 
•Ship timing, ramp cadence, and how many generations.
•NVLink specifics (bandwidth, flavor, coherence) and CPU-DRAM/GPU-HBM memory topology.
•Process nodes and packaging (EMIB/Foveros) for the PC SoC and the custom DC CPU.
•PC SoC scope (NPU, power targets, die/chiplet counts) and NVIDIA rack-level designs.
•Software stack details (CUDA/driver model on Windows/x86; Linux support).
•Commercial mechanics of RTX chiplets inside an Intel-sold SoC and CPU attach accounting on NVIDIA platforms",1368,209,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/y0btounwowpf1.jpeg,new,News,0.98

Blue line → Approximate S&P 500 path.

	•	Red shaded zones → Time windows when each strategist expected the crash to unfold.

	•	X markers + labels → When they made their big calls.



You can see how almost every shaded “crash window” (Dent 2024, Burry 2023, Hussman/Grantham early 2022–24, etc.) has already passed without the predicted collapse. Spitznagel’s window (2024–26) is still ongoing, so his call is the only one not yet “invalidated.”


Bottom line: as of 2025, none have been “right” in calling both the blow-off top and the subsequent crash. The blow-off part (late-cycle mania, AI surge) looks validated. The crash has not yet happened.

**$NUVB (Nuvation Bio)** was founded in 2018 by **David T. Hung, M.D. Oncology biotech** developing next-generation **kinase inhibitors** for genetically defined cancers. In certain cancers, aberrant kinase signaling is **constitutively active (“always on”)**, driving uncontrolled cell growth (tumors).

**Leadership** (see [here](https://nuvationbio.com/board-of-directors/))

* \~**70–80% technical/scientific** (MDs/PhDs in clinical, R&D, operations) vs. **20–30% commercial/operational** (finance, BD, legal).
* top education for all the technical people, past record of leading end to end pharmaceutical development
* James Bond villain Dr Sauvage is here.

Fun fact:

* past success: David founded Medivation, they worked on a drug called **Xtandi** and was acquired by Pfizer for \~$14B (2016).
* failure: David had a setback leading **Axovant** amid Alzheimer’s trial failures
* that failure is often not mentioned and is also part of the bear argument.

**Financial state of affairs**

statements are pretty clear in that regard:

* good cash reserve (already the case before commercialization).
* conservative estimates, taking out exceptional R&D acquisition, they can hold for 2-3 years without any dilution in the radar. they historically burns \~$40–50M per quarter so that's in line with what i am seeing on nasdaq
* confirmed by David during the few conferences in september and his CFO.

**If I say biotech you scream? “Pipeline”**

Pipeline as seen on their [website](https://nuvationbio.com/pipeline/):

* during HC, David **claim** that they are in discussion with the FDA to go for a Head-to-Head trial against **vorasidenib**
   * Clear intention of showing safusidenib superiority
   * They could capture a \~6B market if doing so moving their valuation by a whole bunch.

at this time, **i'll only care about Taletrectinib** (commercial name IBTROZI) for this analysis.

**taletrectinib** (the grim reality):

* **oral ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)**, FDA approved since June 2025.
* [In June 20](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuvation-bio-nuvb-taletrectinib-selected-104653135.html), IBTROZI (commercial name for Taletrectinib) received “Preferred Option” in updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC).
* August earnings have shown a different [story](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nuvb-sales-jump-1043-drug-launch): “…. driving $4.8 million in GAAP revenue, well above GAAP revenue estimates.”
* Not only that: “*According to the company, IBTROZI product revenue (GAAP) reached $1.2 million i****n just 13 U.S. business days after approval***\*, reflecting channel stocking and new patient start\*”
* \~$3.5M analyst’s revenu estimates.
* Long term data shows impressive improved PFS:
   * Patient who used IBTROZI saw better results especially when they haven't been exposed to other drugs.
   * Mild side-effects, pretty much whatever you see in all the medecines you probably have taken in your life.
* Competition:
   * [Nuvalent](https://investors.nuvalent.com/nuvalent-presents-pivotal-data-from-arros-1)’s rolling NDA (Sept 2025) approval **could** be **2026** (priority review) or later
   * When prompt about Nuvalent data, David debunked their studies: “*putting 100 robots, letting them loose on a football pitch and watching just 3 of them cross the 22 yard mark and then claiming 22 as their median.*”

**Some math** (can skip this section if lazy or go straight to conclusion)

Simple revenue model for Q3. I like to be very very conservative. I want to estimate **Q3 revenue** for IBTROZI under **worst-case** adoption, without using early launch spikes (channel stocking, free trials) and **ignoring churn** (only next quarter).

* Let **r = paid starts per U.S. business day over Q3** (**D business days**).
* If starts are uniformly distributed across Aug–Oct, average contribution within Q3 is 2 patient-months per start (way below the current 13 on purpose)
* PM = 2 \* S = 2 \* r\* D
* **Q3 revenue** is then: *R = PM/Price = 2 \* r D \* Price*\*

Using:

* Price ≈ $19.2k net/month (65% of the listed price)
* Three conservative adoption ceilings (the variable r): r = 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 **paid starts per business day**.

**Conclusion**:

* in the worst-case where we avoid early launch distortions and yield a conservative Q3 revenue range of **\~$1.15M–$3.83M (gross)**.
* intentionally, below \~$3.5M analyst’s estimates.
* analysts considered the worst case scenario without considering revenue outside the US.

**The bears 🐻🌈**

the classical ones that you would see in pretty much every biotech company:

* **Commercialization risk**: management have no proven track record **launching an oncology drug at scale** in the U.S. (yes they did Medivation but it seems that success was too long ago for our lovely bear).
* Competition risk from NUVL, Pfizer etc. (imo this can be debunked as long as IBTROZI is *best in class*, granted this could change at any point in time)
* Pipeline uncertainty: unfortunately a very good argument. it is insanely hard to be approved, hence why my analysis is only on IBTROZI

in my quest for value, i am always on the lookout for additional insider activity.

**The bet**

* currently above and analyst estimates are not considering the market outside of the US (they get some juicy royalties in China).
* possible commercial distribution of IBTROZI in japan makes it attractive, in fact Sauvage current stock price is also not considering forward looking statements made by David during the HC Wainwright conference,
* in fact none of the news article even mentioned what he said.

you can check it [here](https://journey.ct.events/view/ea2e92e3-d524-423c-a68a-fe84140ac942).

David mentioned a few points of interests:

* forward looking statements like “looking forward to the Q3 earnings”.
* (random, totally bs 2cts) hearing him talk during previous earning calls he has historically been very conservative in his statements.
* Nuvalent study being bogus and not statistically accurate
* Going on a head-to-head trial

volume is somehow low (possible quick jump in price)

**fair value of this stock: 5-10$ easily**

my 6th sense when it comes to gambling my hard earned money, the competence of the management as well as the conferences makes me think that they will beat some kind of expectations.

especially as far as patient adoption is concerned and revenu estimation.

David, you know, could you go on an other buying spree like you did pre-FDA approval? that would be highly appreciated.

\---

Paperhands pick of the day. Really that simple chat - seeings a lot of this one and no bers. I do no research, I blindly follow the crowd. Buy now, DD later. Why is this a bad investment? Tell me it's horrible. Charts look like good entrance after a dip, 470m daily active users, 13b market cap, was trading over $10 literally 2 months ago. With tik tok rumors / stuff, perhaps this one has some upside too. No idea, I monkeyed in and am doing my dd later.

\---

Update: Tripled down today after posting + doing some DD with chat. As per GPT: ""A recent Snapchat advertising bug in Q2 2025 allowed some ads to be sold at significantly discounted rates, impacting the company's revenue growth and causing its stock price to fall"". Popular with the younger generation and revenue is going up (ie: growing).

Chat told me bug was fixed, it's popular with young generation & just saw a massive dip. I blindly trusted chat. 3k leaps. Max risk exposure for me.

\---

Update #2 (more DD): ""I coach a 13-18yr old basketball team at my ymca and every single kid uses Snapchat exclusively as their primary messaging app. No instagram or X. (In Texas)"". All the young people love / still use this one. More bullish than ever. This one is gonna have a meta moment.

\---

Update #3 (more DD / some handwaved numbers): Valued at like $20 / DAILY user and all users are teenagers. That's undervalued on that alone. I'm sure they can figure out a way to extract more than $20 in revenue from that market. Lots of people have streaks exceeding 1000 days. You just gotta make (quite literally) 2cents off a DAILY user a day to justify it. That's like a single ad. This one is hella underpriced

# THE CORE

* **SEARCH & ADS (NOT A MONOPOLY KEK).**  This is the free-money printer.
* **THE WAR CHEST (CASH AND BUYBACKS)** They're sitting on **$100B+ IN CASH** making billions in interest. AND they're pumping their own stock with a **$70B BUYBACK** program.

# THE HYPER-GROWTH

* **GEMINI: #1 APP ON THE APPLE STORE.** Their model is already the best. Rumor is **Gemini 3.0 is going to eat even more ass**. They have the best photo editing, best video generation, and just bought windsurf. They are winning the AI race right now, and it's not even close. GPT5 worse than Gemini pro v2.5 lmaoooo.  Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
* **TPUs.** This is the hardware *literally built for LLMs* (which is half the stock market now).  They can start selling the shovels in a 20-trillion-dollar gold rush.
   * ""Google was using its own large-scale, custom AI hardware for two full years before its main competitor""
* **AI INCREASING MARGIN**  They're plugging this LLMS *directly into the ad engine* and this means higher margins on their main money-printer. They're using AI to make the printer go *faster*.
* **CLOUD** \- GCP is growing at **30%+ YOY** and is ripping market share straight from AWS and Azure. This is the growth engine.

# THE MOAT

* **YOUTUBE.** This is video, streaming, TV, *everything*. It's the most-watched platform in the world, and Shorts is knee-capping TikTok BY ORACLE
* **ANDROID + PLAY STORE :** hey own the OS for **70%+ of all phones on earth**. Every app, every in-game purchase Google gets a cut. Bless apple
* \*\*CHROME .\*\*They own the browser that literally everyone uses.  They literally PAY firefox to exist.
* **GOOGLE MAPS:** It's a monopoly. Every other app (Uber, Zillow) pays Google to use their maps. Plus, it's the front door for all local ads. They own navigation.
* **WORKSPACE (Gmail/Drive)** They own the productivity suite for half the planet, and now they're plugging Gemini right into it.
* **SEARCH-DATA:** Yes they know everything about you.  Yes they have the most data in the world

# THE MOONSHOTS

* **GOOGLE VENTURES (The In-House Degen Fund)**  Did you know Google is basically a VC fund?
   * **14% of ANTHROPIC** (Valuation $200B 🚀)
   * **8% of SPACEX** (Valuation $400B 🚀)
   * ...plus they free-rolled into **UBER** and **SLACK**.
* **WAYMO:** Self-driving cars. The private market says this bet has **4x'd since last year**. This is the future of transport.
* **DEEPMIND & ISOMORPHIC LABS:** This is the AlphaFold shit. They are using AI to discover new drugs and cure diseases. This alone is a multi-trillion-dollar lotto ticket.
* **VERILY** The life-sciences bet. This shit already raised **$3.5 BILLION**. It's only going up.
* **QUANTUM** This is the long-term bet. If this pays off, they win....and they will.

# THE ""OH YEAH, THEY OWN THAT TOO"" LIST

* **HARDWARE (Pixel, Nest, Home)**
* **INFRASTRUCTURE (Google Fiber, Voice)**
* **REAL ESTATE (The Landlord)** They own infinite prime-ass real estate. Chelsea Market in NYC? That's theirs.
* **CRYPTO:** Yes. They're building a L1.

1niqztt,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 15:20:43,DD - CVNA and COF are overvalued,"TLDR: CVNA (Carvana) 300Put Jan2026, Jun2026 + COF (Capital One Financial) 200 Put Jun2026

Won't go much into CVNA as its been heavily discussed before, along with the much more comprehensive deep dive into their financials since a while back by [Hindenburg Research.](https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/) But I believe that while their books are cooked, the financial pressure will be too much to hide soon.

To preface this, I understand that during economic (non-market) downturns, stocks that deal with poor financial decisions like credit cards and used cars might seem like good investment, but the current situation is different than that of 2008 or 2020. Biggest reason being, [for the first time since 1960'](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/immigrant-population-shrinking-trump-administration-rcna225881)s  US population is shrinking due to the new immigration policies.

These ""recession-proof stocks"" are at very big risk simply because they finance lower income, and often time immigrants, with little to no requirements. They do not care if you're an ""illegal"" immigrant (as long as you have an ITIN), they do not care if you have no/bad credit history, and they do not check if you have the ability to pay them back. Normally this would be fine as even if you default on the loan/debt they will claw much of it back because people usually do not file for bankruptcy and tend to make the minimum payments or work with them for a new payment plan. They can also garnish your wage or seize assets if you declare bankruptcy.

Well then you might ask, how can they fail?

**COF (Capital One Financial)**

Many of the immigrants that are being deported or are self deporting, simply max out their credit before leaving. In fact, during the six month period of January to June 2025, [US immigrant population has shrunk by 1.4 million](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/08/21/key-findings-about-us-immigrants/). Growing up as an immigrant child, this was always something that I saw first hand many times in both the Hispanic and Asian communities. When people were giving up on the American dream, they would often live to their fullest applying for and maxing out as many credit cards as possible, often sending money and gifts back to their home country before leaving.

Capital One (and their recently acquired Discover) is the industry leader in offering credit to people with bad to no credit history. Their application process is very easy and often no question asked where you just claim what your income is, and they'll approve you up to $2-3k per card. Applying for many credit card at once will often be a red flag, but usually the people who are doing this have already have been living in the U.S for a while with existing credit cards. Often they'll just apply for 3-4 more cards to max out before leaving, usually totaling to around $20-30k.

https://preview.redd.it/x5czfktaukpf1.png?width=1530&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb3bffb2eb74ed2ec58f453fe0f9f3fbede42f0e

Their exposure to credit card loans has gone up significantly, over 60%, after merging with Discover, but meanwhile their consumer deposits have only increased about 30%. They are also calculating the new credit card loans acquired at a lower default rate, when in reality the allowance for bad debt should be much higher.

Meanwhile, their stock has gone up to record highs due to the seemingly increase in customer, more cards issued, and volume in transactions. When comparing to industry average, their stock price seems reasonable and correlate strongly to one another.  But in reality, COF is significantly worse than due to their high exposure to credit loans and significantly less deposits.

For Example:  
[Wells Fargo](https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/earnings/second-quarter-2025-earnings-supplement.pdf): Credit Loans \~$50 Billions. Total Deposits \~$780 Billion

[Citi Group](https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/2025fsqtr2rslt.pdf): Credit Loans \~$110 Billion, Total Deposits \~$1.3 Trillion

[JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/quarterly-earnings/2025/2nd-quarter/ac6f00d5-6753-403a-94ca-87a0296fc28b.pdf): Credit Loans \~$390 Billion, Total Deposits \~$2.5 Trillion.

[American Express](https://s26.q4cdn.com/747928648/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-2025-Earnings-Tables.pdf): Credit Loans \~$133 Billion, Total Deposit \~$146 Billion (But their clientele is much lower default rate, and often do not use them for banking)

Even FDIC believes their loans are higher risk than stated: [link](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/capital-one-sues-fdic-overcharge-related-two-bank-failures-2025-09-11/)

and just today, they've adjusted their delinquency rate and charge offs. [link](https://ir-capitalone.gcs-web.com/static-files/e68bf5bc-6f01-4cff-8bfc-67aa1f087232)

**CVNA (Carvana)**

While Carvana has been a long discussed stock here, and with significant amount of people getting burned trying to short this stock this year, I believe the financial pressure will finally be catching up to them.

The first half of this year, Carvana benefitted significantly from Trump's tariff war as people chose to buy cheaper second hand cars as opposed to the higher tariffed costs of new cars.  However, in the second half of next year, I believe this will change as well.

First reason being the immigration issue I previously discussed. Immigrants are often the main purchasers of use cars. Carvana does not care if you are an ""illegal"" immigrant, they will sell you a car regardless. These cars are often sold to them with high interest, financed by Carvana themselves, making their business model seem highly profitable. But these cars are often used for high mileage purposes like delivery services, often depreciating the vehicles much faster than Carvana expects. With significantly lower demand, higher delinquency on payments that are backed by a vehicle significantly more worn than expected, and their ever growing inventory size, Carvana is a ready to explode.

Second reason for Carvana's downfall is lower interest rates (soon) and the deductions new vehicle gets under Trump's new tax code. Used vehicles are not eligible for interest deduction, and lower interest rates means people are more incentivized and more likely to qualify for new vehicles.

Lastly, Carvana's competition is not only CarMax. Car buying/selling has never been easier with sites like Kelly Blue Book. They link you to your local dealership, often times getting a much better value due to lower overhead costs these dealership faces. They've also announced heavy ad spending last earnings (seems desperate and goes against their cost cutting to manage profitability motto).

All in all, I believe they are facing much bigger headwinds than just cooking their books can put off.

First time really posting here, and honestly pretty new to options. Previously I gambled on INTC when new CEO fired a bunch of people and wrote down their asset value, I assume the overstated balance and obsolete assets would be written off ASAP after a new CEO so any further decline can be blamed on previous CEO, thus their balance sheet was actually understated if anything, and bought INTC 20 Jan26 calls when it was @ $19. Open to feedback and discussion, maybe I am just gambling, maybe its an investment.

I’m eyeing MicroStrategy ($MSTR) hard right now and loaded up on some calls ahead of tomorrow’s Fed decision (September 17, 2025). Stock’s at $331 after pulling back from $457 highs, but with their 639,000 BTC stash worth $70B+ at $115K per coin, this thing’s basically a turbocharged Bitcoin play trading at 1.2x its holdings. Q2 crushed with $32.60 EPS, and targets are $540-$700 easy if BTC holds steady.
Fed’s slamming through a 25 bps cut with 96% odds, and if Powell hints at more easing, BTC should run while stocks might dip on jitters. $MSTR loves that setup, lower rates make Saylor’s debt buys cheaper, and it’s got 2-3x leverage to BTC moves. Last year’s cut? $MSTR jumped 12% in a week.

Big catalysts stacking: It’s heavily shorted (15%+ of float, all-time highs in Q2), shorts are bleeding from past rallies, and whales are piling in, grabbing BTC and $MSTR options like it’s on sale. On-chain shows whale inflows spiking, MicroStrategy just added 525 BTC last week. This screams gamma squeeze potential, especially with options flow heavy on calls (2.21 ratio) and triple witching Friday. Break $350, and it could rip to $375 quick.

Plus, Saylor’s in DC today pushing the Bitcoin treasury bill with lawmakers, aiming for the US to stock up 1M BTC over five years as a strategic reserve. If that gains traction, it’s rocket fuel for $MSTR as the poster child.
Chart’s coiling at $328-$334 support, RSI oversold, volume building. Risks if Powell’s hawkish, but jobs data’s weak, so I like the odds. Not advice, just why I’m bullish tomorrow.

\----

I don't understand the risks involved on LDI - so I can't price risk well but still wanted exposure. Chat didn't convince me price action on my options were safe from rate cuts, but I wasn't convinced they were going to drop either. So risks were high. Unlikely I follow LDI any longer past this unless it dips a lot -- I try to identify underpriced risk, which when these options were bought last week was good value. Time to find the next play. $LDI did 100b in loans a few years ago and likely to fly longer term on rate cuts / cycle. I'm unsure how long that takes / where this goes (but wanted investments still) - so deleveraged. I liked what I found, but risks are high. I \*trade\* options and invest in shares. DYOR.

I've made it very clear to chat several times that I use options to leverage my bets & take gains very quickly. I take gains out all the time. These were higher yesterday - todays timing and rate cuts coming make the risk on these higher. Longer term likely a good bet - so still invested quite heavily (50k shares). My strategy is really is this simple: buy the dip, sell the run. These were bought on the dip last week, and if it dips again I may look for another options play on them again.

My risk on these is now 0, so I don't have to follow in depth anymore. I only follow a few tickers at once. I papered out at the bottom this morning, it's up \~4% since I did this.

Well $PSKY has had an active week. A little faster than I had originally expected, but hopefully many of you were able to trail my initial position posted last week to make some money.

* [PART 1: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nedg0a/the_larry_play_paramount_skydance_psky/)

**I figure with all the recent excitement this is grounds for a Part 2:**

1. **$WBD Deal**
   * PSKY is planning a majority-cash, Ellison-backed bid for ALL of Warner Bros Discovery. For those paying attention, WBD planned to spinoff its assets into two separate cos in 2026: one was to be studios and streaming, the other was going to be networks. There was undoubtedly going to be a bidding war for the streaming assets. By getting out ahead of the spinoff and buying the assets before the others could, Larry is boxing out the competition. We have no clue how this is going to be structured. We only know that it’s Larry-backed. That said, we can obviously expect a sweetheart deal for PSKY that totally de-risks any funding concerns.
2. **Oracle/TikTok**
   * CBS reported that Oracle is leading a consortium for TikTok’s US assets. If you think Larry’s not going to use this distribution channel to pump PSKY’s content library, you’ve got your head in the sand. There are 170 million TikTok US users (NFLX has 90 million paid US Subscribers) and 40% of Zoomers’ screentime is spent on TikTok. The conversion metrics could be huge here.
3. **Value Dispersion**
   * NFLX has a market cap of $500B. It lost like $25B in value after the PSKY/WBD deal was announced.
   *  PSKY’s market cap is $20B. It gained only \~$4B in value since the announcement.
   * Even shitty HULU is valued at nearly $30B on Disney’s balance sheet.

**I’m no mathematician, but there seems to be a mismatch here. You can buy what may become the primary NFLX competitor for a fraction of the price.**



**TLDR:** $PSKY.... HIGHER. 

  
**Position**: December/Jan Calls (Supporting Image attached)

But did I cash out and walk away like a responsible adult? Of course not. I rolled straight into a double dumpster fire YOLO:

📉 The Oracle Encore
• 50x ORCL $280 Puts exp 10/17
• Avg cost: $8.10
• Breakeven: $271.90
• Current ORCL: $299.40
• Already +$4,660 today (+11.5%) — Larry Ellison’s yacht fund is shaking

📉 Tesla Clown Car Edition
• 20x TSLA $390 Puts exp 11/21
• Avg cost: ~$30.25
• Breakeven: $360
• Current TSLA: $404.19
• Swinging between +$4k green and -$100 red like Elon’s mood swings on Twitter

Why? Because Oracle’s “AI pump” looks tired, and Tesla’s valuation is more inflated than my ego after a single green day.

If this works, I’ll be swimming in tendies and starting a llama farm. If not, I’ll be bagholding at Oracle World while Elon livestreams me sleeping in a Cybertruck.

1nhzrer,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 18:09:49,Nobody watching APLD,"Nobody on here is really talking about Applied Digital (APLD) and I think it has serious potential. The stock is sitting around 19.50 right now and it has already run over 70 percent in the last three months. What makes it interesting is not just the chart but the actual business story.

APLD is building out high performance data centers specifically designed for AI workloads. They already signed hosting contracts worth over 11 billion dollars, mostly with CoreWeave, which is one of the fastest growing names in the AI compute space. These are not small speculative deals either. They are long term leases that give APLD revenue visibility for years.

The company has about 200 megawatts of capacity now and plans to reach 400 to 500 megawatts by 2026. Each 100 megawatts can generate around 300 to 400 million in annual revenue. Analysts are projecting revenue to grow from about 450 million in fiscal 2024 to over 1.2 billion by fiscal 2026. That type of growth would support a market cap in the 3 to 4 billion range compared to about 2 billion today.

If AI demand stays hot and they continue hitting build out milestones, I think a reasonable short term price target is 25 to 27 by the end of this year. If momentum really catches on and retail wakes up to this play, I could see it testing 30. The risk is execution and concentration with a few clients, but the math lines up.

Right now everyone is watching NVDA and the mega caps but APLD is a pure play AI infrastructure stock that is still under the radar. I am betting it is going to get a lot more attention soon.

There is a play for those who are too afraid to take a position. I'm usually not a fan, but considering how fake the actual economy is versus the numbers it is about the safest play and history dictates that rate cuts drive the price up of the underlying asset.

Paperhands buys first, does his DD later via shitposting in the daily. Here's some very high level due diligence. This company did \~30b in loans last year. It did \~100b in loans in 2020. It's a legitimate company and a large refinancer. The reason for the drop wasn't a failing business, it was due to rising interest rates. They refinance homes / mortgages. In rising rates - nobody does that so business looks bad. Interest rates are cyclic -- they will eventually come back down. When they do (not just 1 cut, but looking several ahead) these guys business booms as everyone wants cheaper mortgages. This can be doubly advantageous - lower rates (people remortgage) + potentially higher margins on the loans (depends how competitive they price things / where interest rates go). I chatted with a few people who have used them and they said they enjoyed the experience / using loandepots products. They advertise themselves as low friction, very quick with competitive rates. They operate in 20 countries, have \~5000 employees & a \~2b market cap. It was trading above $30 in the low interest rate environment circa 2021.

Lots of people worried about insider selling. It's a no story. CEO's compensation is primarily in shares and they jumped massively. I don't blame him for taking profits or derisking. We don't know why he sold. People said the same thing about OPEN (I was a bear also -- because insiders sold sub $1 and they tend to know stuff) -- and look where it went. Insider ownership is \~85% on LDI.

With not much additional DD, I bought more this morning. I haven't look at the finance sheet, etc - as it tends not to matter for my investment style.

Started with around $200k in the account going into August

First play was UNH Jan 400 calls. I opened the position in mid-July, then doubled down and averaged heavy on August 1 when UNH flushed to \~240. Bagheld through Buffet pump to 320, the dump back to 290, and finally unloaded on the rip to \~342. Paper hands would’ve been obliterated, but I diamond-handed it until the pop to \~342 and cashed out those calls.  
[Screenshot 2: UNH buy and sell orders](https://imgur.com/OOg0VQs)

With fresh ammo, I went heavy into FIGMA/LIGMA when it cratered from 140 into the 50s. Snagged it around $51.9, rode it up, and dumped at $58.4.

And then the final boss: went all-in on TTD at $44.18 average.  
[Screenshot 3: Order history — UNH, FIG, TTD trades](https://imgur.com/7qf3zFv)

Now I’m just holding 40k shares of TTD, sitting at just over **$2M**.

Plan from here: looking to cash out around $55–60 on TTD. After that, might take my tendies and start scooping up some beachside condos in Mexico. Real estate can’t rug you with one bad earnings call.

Not financial advice, just the dumbest smart luck I’ve ever had. 🍻

Recently sold the SNAP LEAPS I picked up a few weeks ago, and got flamed by many for suggesting, for a 50% gain. $PATH has bottomed IMO and should be a beneficiary of agentic AI over the next couple years with what look to be improving fundamentals. LEAPS here looked good to me so I loaded.

Best of luck out there you fuggin regards

1ns8te3,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 18:56:00,Follow up on my stock market journey,"Following up on my stock journey. About 6 months ago, I posted my portfolio gains at about 1200% in a little over 6-7 months. In about another 4-5 months time frame, I got the portfolio up to $80K and now back down to $74K.

Strategy is still the same and simple, buy low sell high. Obvious right?

Well, the biggest key strategy or let’s say mindset shift when I started winning is getting desensitized to money. Build a high conviction play, stick to it, DCA if it is lower and company stays the same, and don’t get stop lossed too early.

One of my biggest wins this year was UNH. It is a high value company, got some bad news and dropped like a rock. Market tends to OVERREACT ALWAYS and on either sides too. Bad news = overreact to the downside, then price rebounds to stabilize. Same way on the upside, good news = price surge overreaction and will correct to the range. I bought the dip at around $300 kept DCA to $290 and sold at $350. (I’m back in)

I also study macro trends, and market sentiment. Right now, market is ATH, overall sentiment is bullish HOWEVER, short term wise there is a lot of fear baked into the market. So, theoretically, if traders see big red candles, the downside pressure is higher. So I will be a bear and short most of the day if market is red, looks weak and I don’t see that V shape recovery that I usually see. (Indices did this past week)

I also study the price action, I don’t care about RSIs, MACD trends, etc those are all historical indicators. Nobody will know what the price will do next. But if you really take a look at the chart in one minute frame and study how it behaves: for example AMD, a lot of the time I noticed in the morning it shoots up 2-3%, market is not too bullish, I will scale in my puts because I know that there are no bullish news on AMD and that I notice that the price fades most of the time.

There are other strategies that I use, for example having QQQ SPY up with AMD, where QQQ will drop and AMD will drop in a delayed manner (30-60 seconds after) and might take advantage of that knowledge. A lot more to this, and can explain further.

Currently I am in BMNR and UNH as my two holdings, but unsure of market October. We were supposed to drop September and I feel as if market will drop October and rally into holiday season. But I don’t know that yet, need more data thus still in my positions long.

I threw all the capital into major companies. Not just M7, but well spread out. Caught the rebounds of CRWD and SNPS — made real wins. Sold covered calls that actually made sense: smaller premiums, way less risk. Grabbed puts to lock down my biggest plays.

On Tuesday, the stock suddenly dipped about a dollar, and from what it looked like, someone may have accidentally hit **sell instead of buy**. It wasn’t a huge move compared to some of the volatility we’ve seen in other names, but it stood out because the drop lined up with what looked like an abnormally large sell execution at the wrong time.

Fast forward to Thursday, and things got even more interesting. At **16:00:02**, right after the close, there was a massive **buy attempt of 1,409,696 shares at $79.63 on the NYSE**. The order shows up in the trade log, but didn’t actually go through in full, which raises some questions. Was this the same trader trying to correct their earlier mistake? A fund trying to scoop up a large block at the close? Or just an algorithm glitching out?

Here’s the snapshot from the tape that shows the activity: .What makes this noteworthy is the sheer size—1.4 million shares is not small potatoes, and whether or not it was intentional, it definitely suggests someone (or something) was very interested in loading up. For retail traders, this kind of anomaly is always interesting to dissect, even if it doesn’t necessarily mean anything for long-term price action.

And at that point I knew there was something up with the Nebius chart that I had to do DD on. 

And then I realized the it was like when Sword Art Online came out. It was off to a good start then fell off season 2, which is why the chart declined. 

Then we see star symbols of waifs. I can't read Japanese, but I know it's cute. So stock price went up. 

Then it got replaced when demon slayer came out. the movie was great. And that's when we get serious with the TA. Tanjiro's hairline is spotted on the 1 month chart. That means it does have something to do with Demon Slayer. And because if we analyze the macro environment of the spike of Nezuko Body pillows by 80% after the Demon Slayer movie, we should also see a 80% spike in WEebius group.

Tanjiro always gets up after he gets beaten up, which is just manic character anime plot armor. Even despite a drop today, NBIUS will keep getting back up and going up because it's overpowered.

1nmucye,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 11:05:40,The Federal Reserve’s Dual Mandate Is Outdated And The Data Used For Decisions Are Wrong. A Better Approach From Escorts.,"The Fed claims to balance price stability with maximum employment. In practice, both pillars are built on sand:

Job creation data is constantly revised downward... the latest BLS revision wiped out 911,000 jobs like a bad typo.

The unemployment rate is essentially fan fiction. It counts gig workers, Uber drivers, OnlyFans creators, and yes, technically even escorts, prostitutes, hookers, and strippers as “employed.”

Inflation at “3%” is a joke. My grocery bill, rent, and utilities all disagree.

The truth is, the economy runs on a far more honest set of forces: men’s disposable income to spend on sex work and women’s willingness to sell companionship.

So I propose a new, more accurate Dual Mandate for the Federal Reserve:

1. Balance the number of men who can still afford escorts, prostitutes, hookers, strippers, and sugar babies.

2. Balance the number of women entering sex work out of economic necessity.


Here’s the model:

Bad economy: More women enter the industry due to lack of alternatives while men cut back on spending

Good economy: Fewer women stay in sex work since they have better alternatives; men who can afford it spend more


Forget CPI. The true measure of inflation is the Escort Asking Rate Index (EARI™) a basket of advertised rates across cities. If her hourly goes up, it’s because her rent, groceries, and Uber rides went up. That’s a real-time, boots-on-the-ground measure of cost of living.

So if you want price stability and full employment? Look no further than the front page of Tryst and Seeking instead of opaque & confusing calculations done by economists

As a future Fed official, I’ll ensure every FOMC meeting includes a robust discussion of escort pricing trends before setting interest rates. Powell had his dot plot. I’ll have my thot plot.

1nk5cl8,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 07:10:18,HUGE Deal Between $INTC and $NVDA,"NVIDIA and Intel announced a multi-generation collaboration across PC and datacenter and NVIDIA will invest $5B in Intel at $23.28 per share. The joint solution will be a tight coupling Intel x86 CPUs and NVIDIA RTX GPUs over NVLink for PCs and data-center platforms. Timeframe are TBD and current roadmaps with arm will not change, per sources, meaning NVIDIA will offer both.
 
Overall
 
•PCs: Intel will build and sell x86 SoCs integrating NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets
•Data center: Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA integrates into its AI platforms
•Financial: NVIDIA is committing $5B to Intel equity at $23.28/share
•Scope: Product collaboration—not a foundry manufacturing deal
 
Why it matters
 
•Windows/x86 PCs: Higher-bandwidth, lower-latency CPU-GPU coupling should lift AI inference and pro-app and gaming performance versus discrete PCIe designs. Data center: NVIDIA gains an x86 option alongside ARM; Intel attaches CPUs into NVIDIA’s fastest-growing AI platforms.
 
What we don’t know yet
 
•Ship timing, ramp cadence, and how many generations.
•NVLink specifics (bandwidth, flavor, coherence) and CPU-DRAM/GPU-HBM memory topology.
•Process nodes and packaging (EMIB/Foveros) for the PC SoC and the custom DC CPU.
•PC SoC scope (NPU, power targets, die/chiplet counts) and NVIDIA rack-level designs.
•Software stack details (CUDA/driver model on Windows/x86; Linux support).
•Commercial mechanics of RTX chiplets inside an Intel-sold SoC and CPU attach accounting on NVIDIA platforms",1361,209,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/y0btounwowpf1.jpeg,month,News,0.98

Trump will rig $INTC to go up, forcing companies to partner with them and build their foundry business, for national security and his pride.  


INTC has a trump put, if he sees the stock starting to struggle, he will manipulate it back up.  It’s embarrassing for him to buy a stock with the governments money and watch it go down, especially since he’s known as a business man.  A lot of bad press will occur.

WSJ Reports that the Trump Admin has committed to help intel “find new customers to bolster the foundry business”$TSM is at $1T vs $INTC $150b, a lot of room to runA single meaningfully 14a foundry contract by Apple, xAI, open ai, etc will send INTC up 30%+ overnight.  Why would these companies not at least baby commit to this, to appease trump and get favorable treatment in the future?The US is the most powerful country in the world, and to have that in your back pocket of a company is a scary cheat code.  US takes their national security seriously, and they will insure Intel wins.

Reasons for it to go down

Trump announces he doesn’t care about onshoring US semi manufacturing anymore and shifts policy to globalist mentality and allows free trade of semis

US sells 10% stake in INTC

Reasons for it to go up

Announcement of new investor

Announcement of big company supporting intel 
with orders to appease trump

US policy announced about onshoring more US semi manufacturing

Boasting about trading against GS must mean he obliterated them, after all he brags about his HF career every chance he can, well turns out that smug Ken lost 90% of the value of it's fund. Let this sink in 90%

As a money manager, Scott Bessent's years of inconsistent performance have contributed to a nearly 90% decline in his hedge fund's assets. 

When hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, President Donald Trump’s Treasury secretary, left Soros Investment Management in 2015, he was able to raise $4.5 to make his new firm, Key Square Capital, one of the biggest hedge fund launches ever.

Markets have appluded the choice of Bessent for the cabinet post, but it’s not because Key Square has been a resounding success. By all accounts, Bessent had a stellar run as the Soros CIO for years, but by the end of 2023, his hedge fund had lost almost 90 percent of its assets from the peak: Assets had fallen to $577 million after reaching a height of around $5 billions, according to news reports and regulatory disclosures. Reuters reports that Key Square’s fund lost money in  although the past two years have been big winners, as was 2024.

So the way to make $577 million is? start with $4,5 billion. Bessent is a reTard w hard T.

EDIT: The Dunning-kruger effect is well and alive, retard read article, retard gets butt hurt retard makes up shit that was not in said article. 

I said he lost 90% of the funds value, u fucking chimp, that is the AUM.

CAGR,sharpe and tracking counts for nothing when the fund actually LOST (this is a loss of capital ) all but 2 years since inception.

6 YEARSS OF PAIN AND MENTAL TORTURE.

Bought 100 contracts 130C on 8/12/24 with 12/19/25 Expiry. Sold before today’s pop :( and they’re worth $52ish last I checked but whatever.

Honestly I wish I never found this sub, I can’t remember the last time I didn’t file the 3k loss on my taxes. I just kept putting money into random options while scouring this sub.

At the worst point I had lost 120k of my own hard earned money. Throughout the years I had made the money back through some crazy WSB plays (GymeStonk, Iron net, etc) and within a couple days I’d be back to a huge loss. 

I finally started looking for value plays with LEAPS and my biggest option play were these BABA calls. I bought them with a year and a half DTE with half of my account value. For some reason I wanted to hold for at least a year because I had a feeling and here we are. It was hard to stomach the ups and down constantly but it paid off.
I think I’m done for a long time, I keep checking Robinhood for my next play out of habit but I think I’m going to delete the app after withdrawing it all. I put most of my BP in SGOV for now for dividends.

My advice: If you’re young and naive and lurking in this sub, don’t start trading options, I honestly got lucky. Maybe use a small percentage of your income for risky plays but not your entire investing budget like I did.

Thanks regards, I learned a lot from this sub and maybe I’ll be back in a couple of years but for now, goodbye and good luck.",622,67,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1npfnze,month,Gain,0.96

1nx5a3a,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 13:19:21,The $NEXT Big Play,"Howdy brothers,

After my $CRWV post materialized into a big multibagger this week, hundreds of people have been reaching out asking me for the next big play. Well, it's a liquid natural gas company called NextDecade.

  
$NEXT got inexplicably beat down recently to $7 from the $10-12 range after announcing POSITIVE news on September 10th that it received $6.7 billion to develop its Rio Grande LNG facility. On September 12th Morgan Stanley downgraded their price target on $NEXT which further pushed it down to $6. However, this downgrade was from $15 to $10, still way above the current price.

  
There's been colossal insider buying on $NEXT the last few weeks as well. The CEO recently bought 281,500 shares. He now owns $37 million in stock which is a massive green flag. Aerospace Co. acquired 449,510 shares just last Wednesday. 

  
The 50 day moving average of $NEXT is $9.51, and the 200 day moving average is $8.69. The current ratio is .70 and the debt to equity ratio is 2.77. Financials look solid and indicate an oversold position.

For all these reasons, I believe that $NEXT will be making a big movement upwards in the next two weeks. Calls are absolutely dirt cheap, I bought $7 calls for just $.30, two weeks out. My price target for this trade is $8 plus; this stock is disgustingly undervalued currently.

  
Position: 5000x $7 call expiring Oct. 17th.

1nptl01,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 21:10:46,This stock is NEXT - DD,"Winter is coming… and I think this one is NEXT, positions last pic

I know this position is risky, I might roll but this is why I’m here:

The idea is simple: insiders are loading up right as the company locks in real LNG growth and heads into winter. In the last week directors filed multiple open-market buys: William Vrattos purchased 100,000 shares at a weighted average $6.864, Edward Andrew Scoggins Jr. bought 15,000 shares around $6.46, and a separate Form 4 shows director Jason Dillow’s purchase disclosed on Sept 18–19. These are actual “P” code buys, not grants, and total seven figures of fresh skin in the game.

Why now matters. On Sept 9 NextDecade reached positive FID and financial close on Rio Grande LNG Train 4, and management guided that Train 5’s FID is expected before Nov 15 after recently signing a 1.5 MTPA, 20 year SPA with EQT for Train 5 volumes. Winter gas demand historically tightens the LNG tape, and sector prints like Sempra’s Port Arthur Phase 2 FID this week underscore that U.S. LNG build-out is still accelerating into year end.

The setup is that real project de-risking plus visible commercial deals plus unusually large insider buying can force a rerate from distressed expectations. With shares around the mid-$7s today, the near-term upside case is straightforward: Train 5 financing headlines or additional SPAs into winter could be the next leg while insider conviction anchors the floor. Size it like a volatile mid-cap LNG developer and respect headline risk, but the combination of fresh director money, new FIDs, and contracted volumes is exactly the kind of catalyst stack that can keep propelling this higher.",573,184,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nptl01,month,DD,0.92

1nutrag,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 20:19:19,$SNAP - Everyone loves to hate it,"$SNAP Position: 200,000 shares at $8.15

Sentiment is just awful for after missing numbers quarter after quarter. 

What I like: -Massive DAU and MAU, still growing users, albeit not in North America.

-Revenue is growing YoY, albeit at a low rate.

-Subscription revenue is at $700mm annualized now. They’re aggressively trying to grow it, most recently by requiring a subscription for Memories storage of over 5GB.

-Spiegel is out in public making a lot of speeches and seems to be fired up in turning the ship around. His recent letter to employees showed he has some renewed vigor and talked about “start-up like returns”.

-Balance sheet is ok, leverage ratios are fine. They have time to turn this ship around, there are no dangers of breaching any debt covenants. 

-Valuation is cheap and the stock has been left for dead. Market has no faith in management and it feels like the company only exists to enrich insiders. I like this because it’s priced for failure, yet a hint of a turnaround can easily make this a multi-bagger.

What I don’t like:  -Company can’t seem to turn a GAAP profit. Too many employees, too much investment into non-core such as Spectacles; a lot of fat needs to be cut. 

-Excessive stock-based comp. They are sensitive to it and recently started buying back stock. Dilution rate is decreasing.

-Gross margins at 51% are low for this type of business.

-User growth is mainly in India, where ARPU is around 7x lower than in the U.S.

What needs to happen for the stock to re-rate:

They need to start growing revenue double digits and start showing positive free cash flow every quarter going forward. 

One way to do that is by growing the subscription revenue aggressively as that gets a high multiple and is fairly steady high margin revenue. Keep coming out with must-have features that are only accessible to subscribers.

Another way is to cut a lot of employees. Too many mouths to feed, too much comp, and not enough to show for it. Layoffs are sad, but necessary, headcount keeps growing double digits while revenue doesn’t.

**All 4 of these spreads will return the max possible profit, i.e. 80%-100% plus weekly.**

**If one fails or returns less than the maximum, mods can ban me for life.**

Background: the stock selection is based on a multi factor model, and the option selection is even more complicated, but the spreads are simple vertical spreads so that if the stock is above the short strike the spread will be at max profit.

1nhanqj,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 22:58:38,"+600k this weeks, thanks GLXY","Galaxy Digital was getting crazy undervalued the last couple weeks. Tons of extremely positive news on both the crypto side of their business and data center side. Looking to roll these into 2026's when they should get a portion of their 2.7GW understudy approved by ERCOT (on top of the 800MW they already have approved/leased) and leased out to a big hyperscaler like Oracle, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta.

If the full 3.5GW is approved and leased out at the same terms as their current CoreWeave deal, Galaxy could generate ~$5.25B/year in average annual revenues at 90% EBITDA margins (market cap Friday was ~$11B (@~$30/share), subtract their $3B balance sheet and you get ~$8B in equity value attributable to their crypto and data center business).

Think a fair price in the short term is $54/share (w/no additional approvals) and then gets into the $100's of dollars / share range if they can execute on their 3.5GWs + future power/site acquisitions.

I truly believe this is only the beginning of the journey and we are still so early. Just this week the senior management of the company met with 50+ institutions and I’m expecting we catch a bid in Q4, please keep in mind Galaxy has only been listed on the NASDAQ since the middle of May.

The ticker is GLXY.

It’s the ultimate beneficiary of the current AI infrastructure + Crypto tailwinds.

1nkow7c,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 20:19:37,[GAP]PING UP,"Alright, listen up you degenerates - while everyone is fomo-ing over AI, Semiconductors, Opendoor & New/Old-age tech memes - there's some real $$ to be made on some lesser focused, social arbitrage, value plays that have real potential to make 20, 30, 40%+ moves. I don't know where the rest of them are, but I'm talking about $GAP. This is a weird one but hear me out and look at my dd and let me know if I'm regarded.  
  
So why **$GAP?** I first thought about $GAP after $AEO's most recent earnings, where they shot up 40%+ after hours on results. This got me interested because the headlines for the earnings move were ""Sydney Sweeney"" related and the controversy her campaign generated, which translated into billions of impressions and many new customers. For anyone not on social media, $GAP capitalized on $AEO's controversy with their own denim ad in collaboration with KATSEYE - a global girl group which had recently been gaining insane traction with their own Netflix show, performances, and viral songs (Gnarly, Gabriela, etc.). The $GAP Denim ad went mega-viral across all social media and spawned videos everywhere of everyone replicating the dance in Denim - free advertising for $GAP. At this point, it's just an idea - so let's do some digging:  
  
**WHY DID AEO SURGE AFTER EARNINGS?**

To better understand the potential value $GAP - I wanted to better understand what made $AEO move so much after earnings. Here's what I found:

* Better than expected earnings, EPS $0.45 v $0.20 – 125% surprise beat and 15% YoY increase. They were beaten down after pulling their initial guidance, causing major uncertainty amongst investors.

* Revenue at $1.28B – beat expectations by 4.07%. Revenue was flat compared to prior year but still beat expectations and profitability surprise drove the run-up.

* Share buyback program YTD has reduced outstanding diluted shares by 10%, which contributed to increased EPS.

* Successful Marketing campaign wins in collaboration with Sydney Sweeney & Travis Kelce. According to the earnings call – 40 billion impressions, 700k new customer count, selling out of Sydney’s labeled AE products.

* Cost control which contributed to surprise EPS beat – SG&A down from last year & lower promotional activity.

* Optimistic commentary from management – they noted that they saw “nice upticks” in the AE business in Q3 – signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook – coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline). The revenues remained flat this quarter, which was surprising from how they talked about the success of their campaign, but this was explained by some of their core products being laggers (shorts). The lag was offset by the influx of new customers via the Sydney Sweeney ads.

* They noted that they saw “nice upticks” in the AE business in Q3 – signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook – coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline) 

They were also at a depressed valuation, especially after their poor Q1 Results, with P/E hovering between 9x-11x months after their Q1 earnings and before Q2 earnings. Understandable as the CEO also pulled their guidance for the year, which was a big red flag.

They are now trading at a TTM P/E of 18, and forward earnings above 14+ (I keep getting different estimate numbers, but it seems estimates are being repriced). A bit high in my opinion for a retail brand that hasn't shown stable, consistent growth - *but also not entirely unreasonable* \- and they are coming in with a more positive outlook. The markets are hungry for equities and multiples on average are higher.

They did also have relatively high short interest at \~18% before earnings, which likely also contributed to the sustained price movement upwards with shorts covering their positions. The last short interest data I looked at was on Fintel from 8/29/25 - right before their earnings. Once 9/15/25 data comes out, could validate this assumption.

Overall, the huge run-up doesn't seem to be completely ridiculous. The stock was at depressed valuations with a lot of negativity priced in. Earnings came at a huge beat, hugely successful ad campaign, and upbeat outlook from management. The price is now at an elevated multiple (maybe a little higher than it deserves, but only time will tell), but is not out of the normal for where AEO has traded historically and is not absolutely farfetched (look below:)

https://preview.redd.it/n7w09xaxk0qf1.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=359535c2340cbffd059ce947d3cf5aca44b39d02

**NOW THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY AEO MOVED THE WAY IT DID, WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT GAP?**  
  
First - I looked more into $GAP as a business. They’re much larger than AEO, generating nearly 3-4x their revenues. They also have a larger reach globally – operating in 40 + countries. They also include multiple brands under their umbrella – GAP, Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta. The big driver for GAP is their attempt to reinvigorate their brand, which has been showing slightly positive results in 3/4 brands over the past few quarters.  
  
I wouldn’t say their plan has yielded anything overly positive - UNTIL their most recent KATSEYE ad. For those of you that are unaware, it has gone insanely viral – similarly to the Sydney Sweeney ad, which is when I began looking into the stock for a potential beat / revised outlook on the brand. GAP collaborated with KATSEYE, which is a multicultural POP girl group that has been growing significantly in popularity with the younger demographic.

Their collab has already reached over 100M views on tiktok – just the main video alone (when I first checked, it was at 90M - then 2 days later, it was over 100M). People have been remaking, stitching, re-uploading the ad and those videos have also hit many millions of views (some individual video remakes have hit 40M+ views themselves, and I’m sure I probably haven’t seen all of them). IG has over 60M views ,Youtube has over 20M+ views, the shorts video has 5M+ views.

If we compare that to $AEO's Sweeny campaign, GAP has vastly outperformed in viewership (and probably engagement) across all platforms. $AEO also did pull the main ad off their social media and the supporting ads are also in the multi-millions of views, but they still don't compare to what $GAP has done in a shorter period of time.

\***Note: I did this research last week so the numbers may have shifted higher. Just checking tiktok & IG alone - the main video alone is now at 133M views on TT and \~70M views on IG.**

GAP's vids on tiktok previously were only hitting anywhere between 10-100k views. I think the more recent ones that were towards the top left gained traction as they were closer to the actual ad debut - being brought up by the launch of the ad itself. When a video goes mega viral on a page, it typically lifts the views of the other videos as well.

https://preview.redd.it/ayoqszi0l0qf1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc89f30dfe141cd7109bac05ab4ba2d82f7acb5c

There are also endless video remakes tagging $GAP & Katseye hitting insane numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/jogcin72l0qf1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2504e259f6010f5ea29b1ba1dea4d7cad3572cc6

The ad became the most searched query on tiktok and was also mentioned on GAP’s earnings in late August. The CEO stated they reached over 8 billion impressions, which I believe was probably **understated** as it was likely gathered before the actual date of the earnings for the CEO's interview on Mad Money.

***NOTE - earnings came out 9 days after the ad was released and the Q2 earnings were reporting figures from August 2nd, 2025 - before the ad was released.***

**GAP HAD AN AMAZING AD, WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GAP'S UPCOMING NUMBERS?**

If we look at total sales as of FY 2024, GAP was about 22% of their sales (3.3b/15.1b). I couldn’t find the sales mix numbers on how much Denim they sell annually, but according to ChatGPT – the expectation is that they sell between 10-20% of their revenues in Jeans. At a midpoint, we can extrapolate that GAP sells approximately $400-$500M annually in denim – which I think is reasonable assumption.

Retail typically does not perfectly sell through all of their items, and GAP is not to be excluded from this observation. They'll likely have much more denim to sell beyond what they typically do, and in preparation for a large ad campaign - retailers often adjust inventory for this.

Since it's not easy to find concrete figures online about sales mix - let's use $AEO's earnings as an example to potentially gauge the impact the Katseye ad will have on $GAP. Quote from the earnings transcript ***""Sweeny Signature jeans sold out within a week and some products within 1 day. Demand for her curated online shop of Syd's Picks has been very strong.""***

Prior to their Q2 Earnings - Zacks' consensus estimate for AEO's earnings was $1.23b (about a 5-6% decline from the prior year), while their actual revenue was $1.28b (representing a \~1% decline YoY). This was a beat on revenue expectations of \~$50M. The decline expectations seemed in line with their Q1 report, which was quite depressing. The CEO spoke of all the new customers / eyeballs they got, how they plan on retaining and converting more of these new customers, and had an upbeat outlook going into the second half of the year.

So how can we think about this with GAP? The Ads are clearly different, but I believe GAP's strategic timing and content leveraged the controversy AEO created to boost their own campaign - **and it worked amazingly**. Aside from the screenshots shown above, IG has over 60M views, YouTube has over 20M views, and 5M views on YouTube Shorts - all platforms the Katseye GAP campaign has garnered more views & engagement while being up for a shorter duration of time.

According to GAP’s earnings call, their outlook is to grow Q3 at 1.5-2.5%. At 2%, this would mean an increase in sales of \~$72 million from Q3 2024. GAP had been teetering between decline and flat revenues in the past few years but has seen slight improvements in revenue growth due to their “reinvigoration” efforts **BEFORE the KATSEYE ad** brought on an insane number of impressions to their business.  
  
Now after the Ad, it's blown any of their campaigns thus far out of the water - with reception from the Ad being overwhelmingly positive and garnered even more support as it’s been touted as “the right way” to do an Ad in comparison to AEO’s campaign. The ad itself is just much easier to talk about and spread in younger circles - what kids / young adults are going to be talking about Sydney's AE monologue over the dance and catchy song from GAP?

I believe their outlook (1.5-2.5% Q3 revenue growth) **does not meaningfully include the impact from the campaign becoming mega viral** as GAP had already been growing at similar rates in other quarters (2% increase YoY last Q3 and beat expectations by 2.5%, and similar to the past few quarters). This makes sense to me as well since the campaign launched only a week before the Earnings call.

From glancing at their website and using LLMs – their denim products seem to average near $60 (they run sales / promotions often). Assume they sell $450M annually at an average $60 price point per item - that’s about 625,000 pieces of denim they sell monthly on a regular basis.  
  
Knowing they typically have excess inventory and that this was a large campaign, let's assume a similar number of new customers come to GAP as AEO (personally, I think GAP's campaign will probably be more effective, but won't know 'til Q3). On 700,000 new customers, I think it's a conservative guess to say a million additional items will be sold (about 1.4\~items per new customer), which would translate to about $60M in additional revenue. That alone would be about an additional 1% of revenue. If we assume less conservatively, we could see an additional 1.5-3% beat on top line revenue on their Q3 estimates.

Here are a few reasons why I think they may sell more than a million additional pieces:

* A segment of shoppers that will have purchased additional items outside of the KATSEYE specific products just from browsing the page / walking through the store and seeing other things they may like.

* Shoppers that bought multiple pieces / whole outfit sets – we can see this just scrolling through something like Tiktok.

* The KATSEYE ad being on trend with younger consumers (catchy song, lyrics that are directly comparing themselves to AE and using it to their favor, easy to learn dance) and women/girls – who are the primary target demographic, and this influencing them towards a brand. Even sororities are using it for rush videos, doing the dance in Denim, gaining tens of millions of views, and tagging GAP.

* The videos seemingly performing better in a shorter time frame. In the past 2 days I’ve checked (These are not the latest numbers, I checked a few days ago, they are likely higher now): \*\***NOTE - this is from last week and checking today on 9/18 on just TT & IG quickly, the views have continued to ramp up**

   * Tiktok’s original GAP ad has already gained +10M views, reaching over 100M views now. AE’s main ad was pulled from their pages, but the remaining ads have around 2-8M views. GAP has supporting ads that have outperformed AE’s best ads.

   * Instagram’s original GAP ad gained +5M views, with over 60M views now. AE’s main ad was pulled, and the top residual ad has 12M views.

   * Youtube’s Video is at 20M views, shorts at 5M views. AE’s remaining ad has 8.8M views and 2.4M views on shorts.

* Q3-Q4 is historically stronger for GAP and retail overall

I also went on GAP and clicked into some of their Denim items and put in a Manhattan (10002) / California Zip code (90001), which gave me 40 GAP locations each, both areas were **out of stock for the products in store.** Earlier in the week, the shipping was **also out of stock**, but it seems it is once again available. I tried clicking multiple sizes, colors, and fit combinations – and they all showed up as sold out in store. A lot of them were still not available online, though it does look like they restocked a bit. I also checked other zip codes like 73301 (Texas) and 60007 (Chicago). I did not have the patience to check all the products / zip codes in the world, but I saw enough that convinced me they are likely selling through the KATSEYE collab items. The first ones I found that were in stock was a “Crop Tank Top”, which you’d have to scroll down to find – but seems like the denim items have been majorly successful.

With a potential revenue beat, and similar renewed optimistic outlook off the back of a wildly successful ad campaign that's even being studied in college marketing classes - it's a recipe for a nice turnaround retail story - the one GAP's been trying to tell for the past few quarters.

**GAP'S VALUATION & PRICE TARGET**

Like AEO before the Sweeney pump - GAP is trading under a 10 P/E and forward earnings of under \~11.5. This gives them **room to move** from both an EPS beat, and a multiple re-rating (similar to what we saw with AEO).

GAP has consistently beat EPS (past 10 or so quarters), meaning management has been diligent about costs / been much more conservative in their guidance.

Based on the current TTM earnings (2.34), a 12x P/E ratio would bring GAP stock up to \~$28. Average analysts forward estimates (\~2.07), a 12x P/E ratio would bring it to $24.84.  
  
Now this is not much upside on the stock, but as we have seen before - GAP has been consistently **beat** earnings expectations and being roughly on target with revenue expectations. **With the ad campaign, I'm expecting a revenue beat, which should help with an earnings beat** **(which I would have expected regardless of the ad campaign as stated above), meaning the $24.84 price target is unlikely and is not my target for the stock.**  
  
Then, if we consider that the stock may rerate based on a more positive outlook and that the P/E is already very low - we could very reasonably see a 13-15x P/E.

* At a 2.34 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $30.42 and 15x P/E would be $35.1

* At a 2.07 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $26.91 and 15x P/E would be $31.05

* Assume the forward earnings estimate beat by 5% (conservative beat) - that's a 2.17 EPS, a 13x P/E is **$28.21** and 15x P/E would be **$32.55**

I'm not delusional - I understand that this is a retail company that's been stagnant over the years - but stocks move when the future of a company looks better than expected. The valuation is low, expectations aren't out of the world, & a decent amount of shares short which may have to cover - which is great for a potential beat and subsequent stock price move.

**If sales and overall outlook improve off the KATSEYE campaign and they continue to beat EPS estimates like they have (boosted by an increase in sales) I would say a $28 price target is realistically achievable and good odds landing somewhere between $30-32.**

*TLDR:*

*- $GAP is trading at low valuations with low expectations and decent short interest, leaving less room for downside and more room for upside.*

*- They have an insanely successful ad campaign running currently for Q3, which has arguably outperformed $AEO's campaign. $AEO's campaign contributed to the stock moving 40% after earnings and had a similar valuation / expectation as $GAP now.*

My current position - may add more leaps:

It’s only a matter of time before we get back to that and even higher. I know a good stock when I see one. Prior plays I had big wins on include early investments with archer, joby, qubt, rigetti, rocket labs, and nbis. 

Quick background on redwire. They provide avionics and sensors for spacecraft and other camera systems, software development, and assist in manufacturing other equipment used in space missions and defense operations. 

Hedge funds increased ownership by 1.6m this quarter alone, such as Driehaus Capital and Royce & Associates. 

About 65% is owned by insiders, 15% is owned by institutions, and 20% is owned by retail traders. 

We saw what happened with Rocket Labs, ASTS, and many others… I believe this one will be back to the $20-$30 range very soon, and who knows how much higher. 

Fair market value is $28 (per Simply Wall Street), which implies about a 60% upside from current levels. 

Risks: like many companies in the early stages, there is concern of cash burn and dilution. That being said, for those who may be looking for a 1-3 year hold — this one is a strong buy and hold for me at the current price with a bigger upside than downside in my opinion.

I owe most of this to ASTS, EU Defense stocks, and random speculative plays found here...  I've adopted a new strategy since July, trying to reduce my speculative positions after they go on a tear, trying to avoid the corrections, but not pulling closing the positions altogether.  It takes a lot more time than I'd like, but for the most part I'm sleeping much more comfortably.  I'm also starting to dump the unallocated cash into ETF like VUG, QQQ, XLK...

1nx5a3a,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 13:19:21,The $NEXT Big Play,"Howdy brothers,

After my $CRWV post materialized into a big multibagger this week, hundreds of people have been reaching out asking me for the next big play. Well, it's a liquid natural gas company called NextDecade.

  
$NEXT got inexplicably beat down recently to $7 from the $10-12 range after announcing POSITIVE news on September 10th that it received $6.7 billion to develop its Rio Grande LNG facility. On September 12th Morgan Stanley downgraded their price target on $NEXT which further pushed it down to $6. However, this downgrade was from $15 to $10, still way above the current price.

  
There's been colossal insider buying on $NEXT the last few weeks as well. The CEO recently bought 281,500 shares. He now owns $37 million in stock which is a massive green flag. Aerospace Co. acquired 449,510 shares just last Wednesday. 

  
The 50 day moving average of $NEXT is $9.51, and the 200 day moving average is $8.69. The current ratio is .70 and the debt to equity ratio is 2.77. Financials look solid and indicate an oversold position.

For all these reasons, I believe that $NEXT will be making a big movement upwards in the next two weeks. Calls are absolutely dirt cheap, I bought $7 calls for just $.30, two weeks out. My price target for this trade is $8 plus; this stock is disgustingly undervalued currently.

  
Position: 5000x $7 call expiring Oct. 17th.

On Tuesday, the stock suddenly dipped about a dollar, and from what it looked like, someone may have accidentally hit **sell instead of buy**. It wasn’t a huge move compared to some of the volatility we’ve seen in other names, but it stood out because the drop lined up with what looked like an abnormally large sell execution at the wrong time.

Fast forward to Thursday, and things got even more interesting. At **16:00:02**, right after the close, there was a massive **buy attempt of 1,409,696 shares at $79.63 on the NYSE**. The order shows up in the trade log, but didn’t actually go through in full, which raises some questions. Was this the same trader trying to correct their earlier mistake? A fund trying to scoop up a large block at the close? Or just an algorithm glitching out?

Here’s the snapshot from the tape that shows the activity: .What makes this noteworthy is the sheer size—1.4 million shares is not small potatoes, and whether or not it was intentional, it definitely suggests someone (or something) was very interested in loading up. For retail traders, this kind of anomaly is always interesting to dissect, even if it doesn’t necessarily mean anything for long-term price action.

Still massively under the radar compared to mega-cap AI names. We’re talking:

	•	📈 $11B in locked-in contracts
	•	🚀 Revenue expected to triple by 2026
	•	🏦 Institutional money piling in
	•	📅 Oct 9 earnings = To the moon 🌖 

OCTOBER 9 EARNINGS could be the next launchpad. If they deliver on build + revenue ramp, this thing can see $30+ near-term and $40–50 longer term if multiples expand.

AI doesn’t run on dreams, it runs on megawatts. And APLD is stacking them by the hundreds.

The train isn’t gone yet, but the doors are closing fast. 🚂💨

The Cupertino company has moved staff from working on its new, lighter and cheaper Vision Pro to focus on its smart glasses, which would be similar to those offered by Meta Platforms, the report said, citing people close to the issue. Apple engineers are working on at least two types of the smart glasses. One is being crafted to be paired with an iPhone and will lack its own display. This could be revealed as soon as 2026. The other version will contain a display similar to the recently released Meta Ray-Ban Display.

Apple's smart glasses are expected to utilize voice interaction and AI capabilities, the report said. It would also rely on an upgraded Siri, which is projected for a March release at the earliest. They would also feature a much lower price tag than the Vision Pro, which started at $3,499.

Meta released its Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses on Tuesday, Sept. 30. They start at $799 and feature the Meta Neural Band. The AI-powered glasses allow users to ""interact with digital content while staying fully present in the physical world.""",71,96,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nvs275/apple_tables_vision_pro_sequel_to_pursue_smart/,new,Discussion,0.8

1nvpvso,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 20:53:54,$SNAP – The Only Specs That Matter 🚀,"Alright, listen up smoothbrains. While you apes are busy lighting your grandma’s retirement funds on fire buying quantum vaporware stocks with zero revenue and YOLO’ing into Opendoor like it’s the next Amazon instead of a failing real estate pawn shop, I’m looking at a stock that could 10x if this plays out. Yes, the ghost app you use to send nudes to your ex is actually a once-in-a-decade moon ticket.

[“JPow told my wife this was safe”](https://preview.redd.it/a84d6o9qglsf1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=374dc3ecc175dde106a5375911dff2da3083c33b)

Now let me explain why your mom’s boyfriend is bullish:

1. **ATH Collapse** – SNAP’s all-time high was \~$80 before Tim Apple slapped them across the face with iOS privacy changes. Ads went limp, Wall Street bailed, and SNAP cratered harder than your mom’s Tinder date. But that’s the reason the stock is sitting at 5-year lows today: **the decline was external, not because the company is fundamentally trash**.
2. **Spectacles = The Real AR Play** – SNAP has been grinding on AR spectacles for a decade. While Zuckbot embarrassed himself with his laugh-track VR demo, SNAP dropped a prototype that actually looks **usable**. Their consumer “Specs” are dropping in 2026, lighter and cheaper than the dev versions. They even built **Snap OS**, a full-blown platform optimized for AR, but you wouldn’t know that because you were too busy watching anime lolis instead of reading investor decks and paying attention to product demos.
3. **8 Billion Daily AR Lenses vs Google’s 14 Billion Searches** – On mobile alone, SNAP’s AR lenses are used **8 billion times a day**. Let me say that again: **8 BILLION WITH a ""B""**. Google search does \~14 billion daily. That means people are snapping AR dogs and anime filters like crazy at HALF THE SCALE OF GOOGLE SEARCH. When Specs launch, SNAP controls **both the hardware and the software**. That means unrestricted ad targeting, a user experience way better than the janky mobile AR crap, and here’s the kicker: they demoed **collaborative AR** between Specs users and mobile users. Imagine shoving ads in both realities at once. That’s a money printer even Papa Powell would respect.

I’m early into this play. Specs aren’t out until 2026, but the market is asleep at the wheel. SNAP’s been buying back stock in 2025, cutting costs with layoffs (10% in 2025), and getting their comp structure under control. They’re quietly setting the stage for the next wave while you guys YOLO weekly SPY puts like brain-damaged chimps.

Now, I’ll keep it real with you:

* Competition exists. But except for Meta, **Google and Apple don’t have social platforms** to tie AR into. Meta is bleeding billions on legless VR Sims. Apple’s Vision Pro flop shows that having the social layer is critical.
* Stock comp was a headwind, but layoffs and buybacks are stabilizing things.
* User growth is slowing but that’s true for all social media platforms. SNAP has 900 million monthly active users. The key is jumping onto the next big thing that feeds into revenue.
* CEO Evan Spiegel has majority voting rights. Which means if he wakes up one day and decides to turn the ghost into a furry NFT, we’re screwed. Expect some WSB level decisions at times.

**Bottom line:** SNAP is sitting near its 5-year low, the market has priced in zero upside, and the next catalyst (Specs) is massive. From here, this can only go up. Not financial advice. I am jacked to the tits.

1nvla89,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 17:34:32,Exited too early on a 40x trade…,"Been pretty shaken up about this for hours now…

Thought I made a great trade when I bought and sold this Eli Lilly call option yesterday for over +500% profit (turned $179 into $1,086 within the same day) 

I had to sell this contract and cash out because I needed the money to cover the amount I was short on rent (which was due today), pay some bills, and afford groceries & other necessities - Also didn’t think that exiting the position when it hit 6x was that conservative. 

Before anyone comes at me for “gambling to make a living/afford food & rent” - I actually work full-time in finance, in office 5 days a week. But anyone familiar with UK salaries will understand that a job is simply not enough, especially if you’re relatively young/entry-mid level, which I am (The average rent in London is higher than the average monthly take-home pay in this city…so yeah). 

I had bought this call when the stock price was $730 yesterday, and sold when it hit $760 (which was my strike price anyway). 

But if I had known that it was going to increase by 100 POINTS in 2 days (past $830), I would have obviously kept it. 

The figure at the top of this contract isn’t 100% accurate (the highest price I saw on the option chain was around $7,335), but even just based on this amount, I missed out on an extra $6,000 of profit. It would have alleviated so much of my financial stress; and having turned $179 into $7,075 with one  ~40x trade would have been an amazing feeling.

Yes, ENSG has a larger portfolio  
Yes, ENSG has better margins

But to justify a \~5x greater valuation by market cap? See chart below:

|:-|:-|:-|
|**Market Cap**|$2.13 billion|$9.97 billion|
|**SNF Beds**|32,208|\~35,427|

|**P/E Ratio (Approx.)**|10-15x|\~30x|

Targeting $30 by 2026. We will see if the medicare fraud allegations and CFO shenanigans is worth $5 billion in market cap.

\---

Lots of people been asking me for my DD on gap - so here's a weeks worth of insights & market research into $GAP. I think there's potential, but we won't know the result until ER's.

Traditional metrics at a glance before diving in.

**Price & Value:** It's currently trading at a P/E of \~9.5 which tends to signal ""undervalued"" or ""something is wrong"". Which one is it here? I compared to competitors -- LULU has a P/E of 12 & AEO: P/E of 16.5. We need to rule out ""something is wrong"" -- which I discuss below (is GAP dead?). It's trading at a significant discount... why?

**Stability**: GAP has a solid dividend (\~3% at the time of posting) & has been around since the 1960s. It is a very well known and recognized international brand that's not going anywhere.

**Sentiment**: Everyone I chatted with was bullish on GAP. I didn't see many real big bear arguments other than ""it's a dead brand"" and ""insiders sold 500k shares"". I commented on those below & would like to hear more views on why this is a bad investment or my thesis is wrong / will not play out.

**Team:** You can do your own research into the executive team here, I had a glance over a few people. They have a solid team who can execute & who I believe are genuinely interested in turning the company around. Current CEO ran Mattel for a long time & was heavily involved in growing barbie, hot wheels & fisher-price. He's been CEO of GAP for \~2 years and doing well via his playbook. The rest of their executive team also has an impressive history. Price hasn't really moved in the last 2 years despite good execution (imo).  [https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/about/leadership/executive-leadership-team](https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/about/leadership/executive-leadership-team)

**Current Average Analyst PT:** \~24.4

**Catalyst**: They just launched their most successful ad campaign ever -- I validated it was real myself. I haven't seen too many in the investing world talking about it. See the reference source below (another WSB's DD) for tik tok impressions - it's over 100 million views on just one video. Their youtube ad has over 3x the number of impressions as the AEO ad did and the campaign is considered by many to be ""more successful"". They got over half a billion views in aggregate. **The ad campaign started on AUG 19th, ONLY 9 DAYS BEFORE THE LAST ER's & resulted in an 8.5% increase in foot traffic during the first week.** The rest we don't know (we can only speculate). We won't know the true results until next ER's. I looked at the google trends for bullish terms related to this campaign / ad -- see below. We won't know if this was a one off event or the start of a trend until ER's.

**Similar Events:** AEO launched a highly successful ad campaign (Sydney Sweeney has good jeans). I looked at their google trends & diffed them. The trends on this one actually did jump on this ad campaign, similar to how AEO did. And the jumps seemed more pronounced on GAP.

\---

**Trends (correlated to online sales):** \~40% of gaps sales come from online, some search terms spiked by 200-400% interest. GAP order spiked by \~450%, GAP buy by \~500% & some other related terms I looked up had similar spikes. We're operating on incomplete information here -- I can't quantify how the trends map to sales (they do tend to be correlated tho). Search interest != sales

[Various terms to buy gap online spiked by 200-400&#37; - shown 5 year average](https://preview.redd.it/j3kfhe7jukrf1.png?width=2476&format=png&auto=webp&s=083a51a039a23b3b63ca54b0a43209e12b1e6b33)

\---

**Trends (correlated to in store sales):** \~60% of sales comes from in store (citation needed -- someone clarify numbers please). This jump in august (ie: before school season) doesn't typically occur. There is a periodic trend that can been seen spiking in November (what happens in nov???). I noticed this across all search terms. Search interest for ""Gap location"" spiked by a staggering 800% and ""Gap store"" spiked \~300%. The Aug / sept spike doesn't usually occur - it's a unique event (which I suspect is related to the ad campaign).

\---

Relative spike / comparable one for AEO (It also lasted a similar amount of time). For comparison purposes. For reference -- AEO is up from $11 to $17 (55% since they started their ad campaign). GAP is up... \~2% (\~$21 -> 21.7)

\---

**ER's Call:** I listened to the entire ER's call. You can find it on youtube here. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQpVaT0MNpA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQpVaT0MNpA) . Transcript can be found here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GAP/earnings/GAP-Q2-2026-earnings\_call-351764.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GAP/earnings/GAP-Q2-2026-earnings_call-351764.html)

**Insights**: TLDW: Focusing on growth, brand. Mentioned ad a few times -- but didn't push it or mention potential impacts much. CEO dropped some hints, but I don't think they were picked up on by many

**\~28:40** (Katrina O'Connell, CFO): ""Last quarter, we previewed an estimated net tariff impact of fiscal twenty twenty five of approximately 100,000,000 to 150,000,000 from the April trade policy. I am proud that the teams have since mitigated the majority of that impact. Reflected in our outlook today is the estimated incremental impact related to the latest trade policies effective August 7. Starting with full year 2025 net sales, **we continue to expect net sales to be up 1% to 2% year over year**. Our outlook assumes ongoing strength at Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic, and a longer recovery at Athleta.""

**\~42:40** (Richard Dickson, CEO): ""This campaign, which launched last week starring Katseye, has driven record breaking response for the brand. Early reads. This is striking range of probably being one of the most iconic brand campaigns certainly that we've done, but that is out there. People aren't just watching, but they're actively joining and **suggesting that this is actually a cultural takeover**. These are great proof points and elements that, again, the playbook is working"".

**My read / take:** They are forecasting not a huge jump in net sales & didn't push the ad super hard as the results were unknown. They mentioned their ad got 20million views in the first 3 days. I don't think people paid too much attention to it on the call, via the Q&A at the end. Search for ""eye"" in the transcript - it was only mentioned twice as far as I can tell. GAP has had a beat on the last 8 ER's. You can validate this yourself. They seem to undersell themselves on guidance / projections each time (ie: I think CEO might sandbag guidance to get beats every time). Tariffs were mentioned \~30 times on the call - I think that's the concern most analysts had (risks) & was a major discussion point (dominating the ad campaign)

\---

**Bear Arguments:**

**Insider Selling (recent 500k):** For people worried about the recent 500k share insider sale. I looked into it. As per google: ""Following the transaction, Mr. Fisher directly owns **12,835,433 shares**, indirectly holds 2,829,502 shares by trust, 132,257 by spouse and 22,015,000 by limited partnerships"", ie: **he owns \~38million shares** still. He's been a director of GAP since 1990 & he sold \~1.5% of his stake. **He's 71**, probs just want a house on the water or something. **I give him a pass.**

**GAP IS DEAD:** I asked around a bit (including talking to girls in the bar, and had 3 friends go to the store and talk to employees / view foot traffic). I don't believe this is true. Several of the girls I chatted with were into GAP (aged \~24-28) and two had even heard of the katseye ad. I asked a few investors to chat with their kids / wives / etc, and several were into GAP right now (who previously were not). I don't have a large enough sample size to say much about this -- but talking around I don't think it's true. I even went as far as had a few friends physically go to the stores and chat with employees. I got some mixed reviews on how much busier gap is, but the general consensus was ""its been getting a little busier these last few years""

**Low Trade Volume:** Welcome to buying things market hasn't noticed yet (or just be completely wrong, both are possible). Nobody was talking about GAP on the investing forums I frequent / lurk. It has very little volume, IV is super low. It's cheap via all traditional metrics as compared to competitors. I suspect people will start to look at / evaluate GAP as we get closer to the ER's. I really have no idea tho -- low volume just signifies to me that not many people are looking at it (yet) - which gives me a little more confidence in my thesis. It means I'm either early or just wrong. The catalyst outlined \*already occurred\* and I'm just trying to price in the effects of it. The general consensus I got from other investors (who hadn't looked at anything) was ""gap is dead I thought?""

**Tariffs:** As per above, tariffs were mentioned \~30 times during the last ER's. It was a major talking point, and although it is a risk, imo it's been priced in already. Literally everyone already knows about them & all the analysts considered them when coming up with their existing estimates. ie, imo, priced in.

**I need more bear arguments, please comment bear arguments or correct / highlight misinformation in my thesis. Why won't this thesis play out? I'm aware that trends != sales, I'm operating on incomplete information. If we all knew the results of this it'd be perfectly priced in already**

\---

**Some sources (WSB DD):** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping_up/)

TLDR of the DD: Super successful ad campaign (similar to how AEO used sydney sweeney) - but GAPs is looking more successful. Their Youtube ads got over 3x the number of views in a shorter period of time compared to the sweeney ads & GAPs ads have also been insanely successful on tik tok - generating hundreds of millions of impressions. It went viral with the younger generation. Inventory related to the campaign was sold out across the board everywhere the original DD guy looked.

**Comparison of AEO vs GAP campaign (ie: fighting for cultural relevance).** [https://www.brandvm.com/post/gap-vs-american-eagle-ads-2025](https://www.brandvm.com/post/gap-vs-american-eagle-ads-2025)

TLDR: Looks like GAPs campaign had larger impact & even resulted in increased foot traffic during the first week.

**Another high level source / thread:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american\_eagles\_earnings\_blowout\_is\_bullish\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american_eagles_earnings_blowout_is_bullish_for/)

TLDR of the DD: Similar catalyst for GAP as AEO.

\---

**Realistic price targets:** Putting a P/E target of \~12 (imo it is growing after what I looked into) puts the price target up to \~27.5-28.0. They've beat their last 8 er's and market isn't rewarding them for it yet. Their executive team has been delivering ever since Richard Dickson took over as CEO. I also suspect sales may come in hotter than expected resulting in a beat, suggesting even higher targets. I don't see much more downside here, I've been averaging into more calls

\---

**Poker room:** I posted my positions to WSB's. I was doing DD / market research in the comments with some other investors. Mods silently removed it after a week without telling me. A lot of people picked up on this & asked me why it was removed. Mods didn't give me a reason -- I'll let you guys decide why they would do that

\---

If you can't stomach the volatility in my positions - then my trading style is not suited for you. I'm either early or wrong, we will know at the next ER's.

Sentiment is just awful for after missing numbers quarter after quarter. 

What I like: -Massive DAU and MAU, still growing users, albeit not in North America.

-Revenue is growing YoY, albeit at a low rate.

-Subscription revenue is at $700mm annualized now. They’re aggressively trying to grow it, most recently by requiring a subscription for Memories storage of over 5GB.

-Spiegel is out in public making a lot of speeches and seems to be fired up in turning the ship around. His recent letter to employees showed he has some renewed vigor and talked about “start-up like returns”.

-Balance sheet is ok, leverage ratios are fine. They have time to turn this ship around, there are no dangers of breaching any debt covenants. 

-Valuation is cheap and the stock has been left for dead. Market has no faith in management and it feels like the company only exists to enrich insiders. I like this because it’s priced for failure, yet a hint of a turnaround can easily make this a multi-bagger.

What I don’t like:  -Company can’t seem to turn a GAAP profit. Too many employees, too much investment into non-core such as Spectacles; a lot of fat needs to be cut. 

-Excessive stock-based comp. They are sensitive to it and recently started buying back stock. Dilution rate is decreasing.

-Gross margins at 51% are low for this type of business.

-User growth is mainly in India, where ARPU is around 7x lower than in the U.S.

What needs to happen for the stock to re-rate:

They need to start growing revenue double digits and start showing positive free cash flow every quarter going forward. 

One way to do that is by growing the subscription revenue aggressively as that gets a high multiple and is fairly steady high margin revenue. Keep coming out with must-have features that are only accessible to subscribers.

Another way is to cut a lot of employees. Too many mouths to feed, too much comp, and not enough to show for it. Layoffs are sad, but necessary, headcount keeps growing double digits while revenue doesn’t.

1nulltc,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 14:47:48,Commercial Real Estate (Offic Focus) Analysis,"Analysis of Commercial Real Estate Markets  
(Working Draft)

Originated: 02/01/25 10:27 am CST

Last edit: 02/18/25 3:14 pm CST

 

Authors note: I've been holding on to this for a couple months; after getting exactly 0 job interview (and being correct on the first hypothesis), I wanted to share with y'all in hopes that you may profit.

 

Primary Hypothesis (moderate-strong confidence):

The commercial real estate market is potentially entering a more turbulent period.

Despite the strong economic recovery since 2020, the commercial real estate space has continued to struggle, particularly office space.  
  


As monetary conditions remain relatively tight, it is possible that mortgages written on properties in a low-interest rate environment may struggle to be refinanced; this may be exacerbated by workflow trends, increased vacancies, and stagnating fundamentals  
  
Secondary Hypothesis (moderate-weak confidence):  
  
The insurance industry largely prefers to reinvest premiums in fixed-income and interest bearing assets.  
As we have transitioned from a low-rate environment to a high one, I anticipate that any risks associated with low-yield instruments held on balance sheets have been properly hedged by now.[\[1\]](#_ftn1)

However, with an increased cost of replacement materials due to elevated inflation/wages and increasing prevalence of natural disasters, I believe that underlying market fundamentals may have shifted; the underwriting process is becoming more challenging. In the pursuit of greater returns (and based on personal/quantitative analysis), I believe this industry may be seeking out returns in a manner that is sub-optimal.

 

Tertiary Hypothesis (weak confidence):

As banks have shied away from lending, private credit, private equity and non-banks have stepped in to fill the gap in lending. This tends to be less regulated, and may be implicated in the above referenced.  
  
\*I will probably ignore the last hypothesis for now.  
  
  


**Initial Data:**

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/zya7ce5shcsf1.png?width=539&format=png&auto=webp&s=520736582f5944d516723cdf9c4fe3fe1b2106b2)

Fred Data:  


Figure 1 shows the total amount of commercial real estate (CRE) loans held by all commercial banks through Q4 2024.[\[2\]](#_ftn2)  Figure 2 shows the annual change of CRE loans through Q4 2024.[\[3\]](#_ftn3)

Comparing the two, the percentage annual change became positive in Q4 of 2012, experienced (at least two) local peaks in Q1 2015 and Q3 2022, and has been below single digits in the last two quarters (2024 Q3: 0.3%, Q4: 0.6%).

A critical component of loan origination is the Federal Funds Rate.

 Below, a table that includes the total value of these underlying loans, 3 months pre/post the calendar month in which the Federal Reserve changed the direction of interest rates:

 

 

  
  


 

||
||
|Date|Amount ($B) or rate shift|Change ($B)|% Change|
| 9/1/2015|1734.044| | |
|12/17/2015|rate increase|97.746|5.636881|
|3/1/2016|1831.790| | |
|5/1/2019|2230.241| | |
|8/1/2019|rate decrease|63.294|2.837989|
|11/1/2019|2293.535| | |
|12/1/2019|2320.046| | |
|3/3/2020|rate decrease|64.232|2.768566|
|6/1/2020|2384.278| | |
|12/1/2021|2531.718| | |
|3/17/2022|rate increase|129.685|5.122411|
|6/1/2022|2661.403| | |
|6/1/2024|2998.333| | |
|9/18/2024|rate decrease|8.457|0.282057|
|12/1/2024|3006.790| | |

 

This would seem counter-intuitive: when interest rates rise, the magnitude of change over a +/- 3 month period is greater than the magnitude of change when interest rates fall.[\[4\]](#_ftn4)

There are at least two (or more) likely explanations for this:

1.      In an economic environment where rate increases are warranted, lending activity is elevated. When interest rate decreases are warranted, lending activity is depressed.

2.      When interest rate increases are expected, origination's are increased in anticipation. When interest rate decreases are expected, originations are delayed in anticipation.

I have also analyzed this 1 month pre/post (not included): a similar pattern exists and may be included in further versions.

Market depth:  
  
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis[\[5\]](#_ftn5), the Commercial Real Estate Market was valued at $22.5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Back then, banks and thrifts held the majority of the $5.9 trillion debt (50%), followed by Government-sponsored enterprises(17%), insurance companies and securitized debt (approximately 12% each).  


According to Statista, the total in 2025 is expected to be $25.79 trillion.[\[6\]](#_ftn6)  
  
According to Janus Henderson, the Commercial Mortgage Backed Security market is worth approximately $1.7 trillion as of Q4 2024.

https://preview.redd.it/56lykeo0icsf1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c4bf1c5fe061270bacbd55522fb4e338c48984a

**Background (CRE/Office emphasis):**

The data suggests that the United States remains in a period of economic expansion. Through Dec. 2024, the benchmark indices have gained more than 50% in two years.

However, recent GDP growth has slowed in the most recent quarter (2.3% Q4 2024 vs. 3.1% Q3 2024).[\[7\]](#_ftn7)  
  
The author of this document is restraining this document to a specific segment of the macroeconomic picture: commercial real estate.

For example, a recent article from Commercial Real Estate news states that there was 5.8 million sqft of negative absorption in the most recent quarter, with 57 million sqft for FY 2024. National vacancy for office space sits at 20.9 percent, up from last years 19.4 percent.[\[8\]](#_ftn8)

  
49 out of 93 office markets recorded negative absorption in the latest quarter.[\[9](#_ftn9)

  
The entire space has approx. 5.46 billion sqft of space. Average asking rent was $38.20/sf, up from $37.67/sf a year earlier, representing 1.4% increase in rent overall.  
  
(Author’s note: I intend to add more to this)  
  
Data:  
  
**Graph #1: CMBS Issuance Data (**generated from csv file; Source :Trepps)  


 

https://preview.redd.it/1p0c4wk7icsf1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b84d0922fb35ab1430986dd5d9a4d11ec31ade



This is a time series of CMBS issuance data, in $T(Q2 2024-Q1 2010). In a vacuum, when analyzing risk assets, one would assume an exponential slope. I am not certain that applies here.

  
A notable inflection in the data occurs between the Q3 and Q4  2019 data points ($1,595.9 Billion to $1,634.4 B, a sequential change of \~$38 B). The following points a less steep increase, starting in 202

The slope of the graph starts to accelerate for the Q2 – 2021 data point (as the economy began re-opening), and began to flatten again in Q1 – 2022. The Federal Reserve beginning to hike interest rates in March of 2022.  
  
(simplified) context: origination tends to slow in rising/elevated interest rate environments, and the term of loans for commercial real estate properties generally have a duration of 5-10 years.  
  
The Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates in September of 2024, and they have fallen a full percentage point; however, inflation remains persistent, and the current signaling is no further cuts until June of 2025. Below, the head and tail of a CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) table.

The above two graphs represent delinquent loan count by type and a delinquency time series, respectively. without having a dataset to work on but briefly (Jan. 25):

‘Office’: 10.03% (only two time points have surpassed this: July 2012 and December 2024)

‘Retail’: 6.72%

‘Lodging’: 5.76%

‘Multifamily’: 1.55%

‘Industrial’: 0.44%

**Additional Individual Analysis:**

This is an extension of a series I wrote between December 2022 and March 2023. While lacking precision, I was correct in predicting the conditions that led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

I am taking a more measured approach now, but the following are personal observations that I have made as a resident of Dallas, Texas.  
  
I started noticing many “For Lease/For Sale” signs, in addition to ones that were there before I lef

This is an image of an approximate 3.5 mile route I drove. Residential zones are in gray, while yellow zones are commercial properties.[\[10\]](#_ftn10)

In total, I counted 17 different signs advertising space for rent.  
  
One of the signs that stood out most prominently for me was Engvest. I went to their website, where they advertise “over 1 million sqft of property under management”.[\[11\]](#_ftn11)  
  
Going through the total listings I manually collected a dataset (n=96 with at least one redundant entry). the listed spaces were for entire buildings, not units; large amount of rent/sale prices were listed as “negotiable”.

  
Here’s a few included as a reference:

|14355 Torrey Chase Blvd | Houston, TX 77014|2900||269900||
|2152 W NW Hwy Ste 122 | Dallas, TX 75220|2515|negotiable|||
|5876 E Berry St. | Fort Worth, TX 76119|12500|7000.00/month(total)||Industrial (note: says $7500 in ad)|

|315 North Greenville Avenue | Richardson, TX 75081|25743.96|negotiable|negotiable||

  
Of note is 3876 E. Berry St., that has a listed price of $500 less per month than what was written in the body of the text, a property that only appeared to be digitally rendered, and an actual, running restaurant (it was BBQ but I forget the brand).

\*Note: I seem to remember the data being different when inputting, so a similar pattern may have occurred elsewhere

 

**Skyscrapers:**  
  
After gathering these data points, I was looking to find a firm in order to investigate further.

I found a company listed as the Texas Hedge Fund Association listed at 1700 Pacific Ave, Dallas, TX, 75201. I went in, talked to security and went to the listed suite #4100; completely vacant.  
  
I went back to the security desk at the front and asked for directions to the 14^(th) floor; that floor was vacant as well (see below).

 

In total, out of the 49 floors in this skyscraper, 20+ were vacant. Below, a snapshot of that property from LoopNet[\[12\]](#_ftn12):

https://preview.redd.it/hv3xgnojicsf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=de8d4535c545616172601bea0a27c33938612aa4

4 stars and A class building. I suspect the A class rating was obtained through renovations, so would anticipate that it gets relegated to “B” in 2026.  
  
**Texas Real Estate Investment Association Pitch:**

I decided to attend an employment/investment pitch held in Dallas, TX. The final two hours being devoted to commercial real estate; the analysis of the speaker was that we were going from a “hot” residential market to a “lukewarm” one. Commercial real estate was were the “big money” was to be made.  
  
Return on investment was projected to be 100% over a five year period, with a standard LTV said to be 70% and a typical rent increase of 10% year.

 At the end, the presenter was asked by the author about office space:

“We don’t invest in any office space, a lot of those properties are selling for $.40 to $.50 on the dollar”.  
  
The author was then talking to a broker seated nearby. Through the conversation, the broker shared that they work as a lender with various insurance companies; with customer premiums (and the lack of payouts through claims), investments were being made in commercial real estate properties. These were largely non-securitized, so they did not have to reference the SOFR benchmark.

 

**Demographic Change and Building Forecasts:**  
  
For this portion of analysis, I am planning to compare demographic changes for metropolitan areas and CRE vacancy/construction (in progress).

Briefly, on average, cap rate went up, U.S. vacancy rate went up, sale price went down, SF under construction went down, inventory went up.  
**More skyscrapers:**

The green building, from conversations with employees, had an occupancy rate of 70%. The blue building had no permanent tenants (save potentially a café), as it was being converted to apartments.

Below, one of the yellow properties:

Using the smaller of the two estimates: 176,xxx/592,xxx= 70.3% occupancy at best.  
  


**Where does this show up on financial statements?**

A good place to look is on balance sheets of banks that now hold real estate due to foreclosure. Loan origination and loans held for sale are also starting points, but imperfect. If this were to be of material impact, I would expect this to appear (after the fact) in credit profiles. Pre-arranged revolving credit agreements may be a fruitful starting point as well if worst case scenarios are assumed.

**Is this temporary? Are we at the end of a cycle?**

My inclination is no, and that the real impacts well be felt in the coming quarters.

**How can one potentially profit from this?**  
There are multiple ways. My starting point is trying to find regional banks most exposed, non-bank lenders that may be extending loans on properties where the fundamental and market values are different, and (hopefully) analyzing CMBS tranches in more detail to understand if the property loans that underly them are actually as sound as stated.

Sky is the limit, too much noise recently.

UiPath partners with OpenAI to integrate its advanced AI models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-5, into enterprise automation workflows. This collaboration, announced on September 30, 2025, includes a dedicated ChatGPT connector that combines OpenAI's frontier models with UiPath's orchestration tools to speed up AI agent development and deployment. It also features a new benchmark for evaluating computer-use models in agentic automation, along with support for Large Action Models (LAMs) to handle complex business processes. OpenAI models are already embedded in UiPath's Agent Builder, and the company offers official connectors for the OpenAI API in its Marketplace, allowing seamless use of LLMs for tasks like text generation and decision-making. This builds on earlier integrations, such as Azure OpenAI Service via Microsoft, but the direct partnership focuses on enterprise-grade AI enhancements.

It’s puzzling that analysts remain so bullish handing out “Buy” ratings and lofty targets, despite biotech’s high failure rates and frequent 50–90% stock declines.

Would love to hear different perspectives - especially from anyone with biotech investing experience.

1ntyifa,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 20:12:11,DD: why i am all in BITF,"Bitcoin Mining to Gov-Grade AI Cloud?

1. Board Appointment Signals a Pivot

On Aug 18, 2025, Bitfarms appointed Wayne Duso (ex-AWS & Dell) to its Board.

Why this matters: Duso helped scale AWS GovCloud and Dell’s $B+ businesses. His expertise is hyperscale cloud + government compliance (FedRAMP, FISMA, DoD IL5/IL6).

Speculation: Bitfarms may be lining up federal certifications for its Panther Creek (PA) site. These are must-have for handling sensitive workloads like defense AI model training.

Quick primer:

FedRAMP High → secure federal cloud for sensitive but unclassified data.

FISMA High → compliance for “severe consequence” data breaches.

DoD IL5/IL6 → Controlled Unclassified Info (IL5) and Secret (IL6) – critical for DoD AI workloads.

Add Duso’s background → very plausible Bitfarms is positioning Panther Creek for Gov/DoD AI contracts (think AWS-style premium pricing).

2. Revenue Potential – AI Cloud vs. Mining

Industry benchmarks (2025):

AI Data Centers: ~$12.5M/MW gross → ~$5–7M/MW net in PA.

Colocation: ~$1.3–1.5M/MW (TeraWulf).

CoreWeave (PA): ~$6M/MW.

Texas & NY AI Cloud: $4–6M/MW (more volatility + higher energy costs).

Panther Creek specifics:

1 GW potential → scale to 500+ MW.

Nuclear + hydro power at $0.02–0.03/kWh via PJM grid (super cheap).

80% NOI margins if certified + locked with a hyperscaler (Amazon, etc.).

At $5–7M/MW, Panther Creek could generate $2.5–3.5B/year net if 500 MW is deployed.

3. Quebec Pilot – AMD MI300X Advantage

Early 2025, Bitfarms repurposed part of its Saint-Hyacinthe (QC) site (~50 MW) for AMD MI300X racks:

Memory Edge: 192 GB HBM3 vs. H100’s 80 GB → fewer GPUs needed for large models.

Cost: $15–20K vs. $30K+ H100 → ~20–30% lower TCO.

Efficiency: 750W TDP; Quebec pilot hit 85% GPU utilization on vLLM inference.

Software: ROCm 6.0+ now supports PyTorch + Hugging Face.

If scaled at Panther Creek:

Revenue boost → $6–8M/MW (thanks to AMD’s pricing + cheap power).

Quebec tests already yield 2–3x mining margins.

4. Talent & Partners Lining Up

James Bond (yes, real name) hired as SVP of HPC on Mar 26, 2025 → likely behind the Quebec AI pilot.

T5 Data Centers provides lifecycle ops, certifications, and multi-year contracts → exactly the type of partner hyperscalers demand.

Locations = edge:

Pennsylvania: Cheap/stable nuclear, undersea fiber routes to EU/Africa, political support for data centers.

Washington: Hydro < $0.03/kWh, West Coast hub with fiber routes to Asia.

5. The Big Picture

Bitfarms is quietly building an AWS-style AI/GovCloud pivot → with nuclear-backed capacity, AMD MI300X pilots, and GovCloud talent.

If certifications + hyperscaler deal land (Amazon is the obvious candidate), Panther Creek could turn into one of the highest-margin AI data centers in North America.

Bitcoin mining may become the “side hustle”; AI cloud could be the real money printer.


TLDR:

Wayne Duso (ex-AWS GovCloud) joins Bitfarms → signaling FedRAMP/DoD ambitions.

Panther Creek (PA) could net $5–7M/MW/year, scaling to multi-B revenue.

Quebec pilot proves AMD MI300X racks = cheaper, more efficient vs. NVIDIA.

Talent + partners (James Bond, T5 Data Centers) strengthen the case.

Locations in PA + WA give Bitfarms strategic energy + fiber advantages.

Speculation but very plausible: Bitfarms is morphing from BTC miner → AI cloud Gov/DoD player.",201,86,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/vpvwexcf27sf1.jpeg,new,DD,0.91

First play was UNH Jan 400 calls. I opened the position in mid-July, then doubled down and averaged heavy on August 1 when UNH flushed to \~240. Bagheld through Buffet pump to 320, the dump back to 290, and finally unloaded on the rip to \~342. Paper hands would’ve been obliterated, but I diamond-handed it until the pop to \~342 and cashed out those calls.  
[Screenshot 2: UNH buy and sell orders](https://imgur.com/OOg0VQs)

With fresh ammo, I went heavy into FIGMA/LIGMA when it cratered from 140 into the 50s. Snagged it around $51.9, rode it up, and dumped at $58.4.

And then the final boss: went all-in on TTD at $44.18 average.  
[Screenshot 3: Order history — UNH, FIG, TTD trades](https://imgur.com/7qf3zFv)

Now I’m just holding 40k shares of TTD, sitting at just over **$2M**.

Plan from here: looking to cash out around $55–60 on TTD. After that, might take my tendies and start scooping up some beachside condos in Mexico. Real estate can’t rug you with one bad earnings call.

Not financial advice, just the dumbest smart luck I’ve ever had. 🍻

US takes their national security seriously, and they will insure Intel wins.

Reasons for it to go down

Trump announces he doesn’t care about onshoring US semi manufacturing anymore and shifts policy to globalist mentality and allows free trade of semis

US sells 10% stake in INTC

Reasons for it to go up

Announcement of new investor

Announcement of big company supporting intel 
with orders to appease trump

US policy announced about onshoring more US semi manufacturing

Really big call option flow on INTC, a lot

1ntoip7,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 13:37:11,"CRISPR ($CRSP) - Sector Tailwinds, Insider Buys & Massive SI","**Hello again, Donald Pump here,**

I hope you are all enjoying the major tendies of my previous 3 posts. I am back again with a new idea which could just sequence brilliant autist genes into future WSB degens for generations to come... 

**CRISPR Therapeutics ($CRSP) - Sector Tailwinds, Insider Buys & Massive SI:**

* I know what you’re going to say: “But Donald, I bought this with Cathie Wood in 2021 and now I am down 70%.” And while that may be true, it’s never too late to make it all back in one trade.

**Regulatory and Political Tide Turning**

* QURE’s new gene therapy essentially cured Huntington’s disease. This is a rising tide lifts all boats moment for gene therapy, and CRSP is the OG.
* The government is already all over this – RFK has supported fast tracking experimental gene therapies, and just this month the FDA published additional guidance on how to navigate this process. There’s now more focus and more eyeballs on this space than ever.
   * **From Reuters**:  [US Health Secretary Kennedy looks to fast-tracking approvals for rare disease drugs](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-health-secretary-kennedy-looks-fast-tracking-approvals-rare-disease-drugs-2025-06-05/)
   * **From Politico:** ""The FDA Published a series of gene-therapy draft guidance on expedited development and review, methods to capture product safety and efficacy data after approval and innovative clinical trial design for the therapies in small populations.""

**Insider Buys**

* There are rarely insider buys at this company. Look at this chart. The last time insiders bought was the stone cold bottom of the taper tantrum in 2018.
   * In July, Simeon George bought $50mm of stock through his fund, SR One. He has been on the board since 2015 and we have not seen anything like this from him before.
   * Another board member, Douglas Treco bought $1mm in August. He has been on the board since 2020 and we have not seen anything like this from him before.
* When insiders who have been with the company for years start buying millions of dollars in the open market, it’s time to pay attention. 

**Fortress Balance Sheet**

* The company has $1.7B in cash and hardly any debt. This is enough to fund operations for years.

**Shrt Interest**

* Last but not least, shrt interest is **30%**! This is about as high as It’s ever been. CRSP is not going to run out of money and it now has a narrative tailwind.
* Q4 is news-heavy for biotech's ahead of the JPM conference in January. For CRSP specifically, keep an eye out for a November heart conference update on its one-shot cholesterol program, faster rollout stats for its sickle-cell gene-editing treatment, and any tidbits on its cancer cell therapy pipeline.

**TLDR:** There is more excitement in the gene therapy space than there has been in years. Insiders are buying, the company has a lot of cash, and shrt interest is just way too high.

**Disclosure:** I am not a biotech analyst, I am just a retard with a Bloomberg terminal. NFA DYOR.

**Position:** JAN 80s

1ntofvm,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 13:34:11,JBS N.V. DD,"JBS: An Investment Thesis
The Bull Case (Pros)
The U.S. beef industry is a  case study in supply-side economics. The fundamental bull case for JBS is not about today's price, currently $14.65 at writing, but about the multi-year tailwinds that are set to drive profitability. Analysis shows that JBS is a long-term play.

1. Low herd count : A Long-Term Tailwind
The single most powerful catalyst is the U.S. cattle herd, which has shrunk to its lowest since the 1950s. This is a structural issue that will take years to resolve. While a tight supply of livestock is a headwind for JBS in the short term, it is a massive long-term benefit. The futures market for live cattle is already pricing this in, with contracts for April 2026 and beyond trading at a premium. This indicates the market believes we are in a seller's market and beef prices will persist, allowing JBS to command higher prices.

2. Diversification and a growing global market 
JBS's strength lies in its diversified portfolio. The company's U.S. beef business may be facing headwinds, but its other segments are thriving. The company's poultry (Pilgrim's Pride) and pork businesses in the U.S. and its international operations in Australia and Brazil are consistently delivering strong profits. 
This diversification acts as a crucial hedge against the volatility of the U.S. beef market, allowing the company to remain profitable even when its largest segment is facing negative margins. The company's ability to maintain profitability in a challenging environment is a testament to the resilience of its business model.


3. Strategic Investments and Growth Catalysts
JBS N.V. is not sitting back idly; it's actively investing in its future. The company is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to modernize its U.S. facilities, which will increase capacity and efficiency. The company is also making strategic acquisitions, such as its new plant in Iowa, to expand into higher-margin, value-added products like ready-to-eat bacon. The company's new dual listing on the NYSE under the ticker JBS is a major catalyst that will attract more institutional investors and increase the stock's liquidity and visibility.

4. Noticeable spike dates: 8/29, 9/2, 9/3
Current short position is 24 million shares representing 7% of the outstanding float. This represents a 24% increase from the prior month. 

The Bear Case (Cons)
While the long-term outlook for JBS is strong, investors must also be aware of the significant short-term risks and headwinds. The bearish case for JBS is not a bet against the long-term cycle, but a bet on the timing and the potential for new threats to emerge.

1. Narrow profit margin is real 
JBS's profitability is a major short-term concern. The company's North American beef division reported a negative EBITDA, a direct result of the high cost of livestock. While the company's other segments are profitable, the negative margins in its largest business segment are a significant headwind that could impact future earnings and dampen investor enthusiasm.

2. Regulatory and political uncertainty 
The U.S. beef industry is an oligopoly, and this market concentration has attracted the attention of regulators and politicians. The company faces the risk of antitrust lawsuits and new regulations that could impact its business model and profitability. While these risks are difficult to quantify, they are a significant factor in the company's valuation. The company also faces political risks from a potential U.S. tariff on Brazilian beef, which could affect its global supply chain.

3. The Risk of a slow recovery 
The bullish thesis on JBS is based on the idea that the U.S. cattle herd will begin rebuilding in late 2027. However, this timeline is not guaranteed. A sustained drought or other macroeconomic factors could delay the recovery, which would prolong the company's profitability struggles and erode the time value of a long-term call option.

4. The business model not without flaws
JBS's core business model is a low-margin, high-volume operation. The company is highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, and it has to pay for a massive supply chain, a significant cost. The company's focus on diversifying into new business segments is a sign that it is aware of these risks, pivoting to a higher-margin business is not guaranteed to be successful.

5. The Options market pricing 
An astute options trader would recognize that even though JBS's options were a good value when bought and better value now based on historical volatility and implied volatility. 
they are now trading at a premium. The market is now pricing in the very catalysts investors have been waiting for. A buyer of options at this point is paying a higher premium for the same potential reward. 
Peer  comparison  and conclusion
Peer Comparison: JBS vs the ""Big Four""
To truly understand JBS's valuation and strategic position, it is essential to compare it to its peers.
 * Tyson Foods (TSN): Tyson is JBS's direct competitor. both companies are facing headwinds in their beef segments, Tyson's greater vertical integration in its poultry business and its stronger brand recognition in prepared foods give it a slight advantage. However, JBS's global scale and direct exposure to the Brazilian and Australian beef markets make it a more direct play on the global beef cycle.
   * Stock Price: ~ $54.50
   * P/E Ratio: ~ 24x
 * JBS (JBS):
   * Stock Price: ~ $15.50
   * P/E Ratio: ~ 7.5x to 15x
The earnings multiplier (P/E ratio) shows that JBS is currently trading at a significant discount to its main publicly traded competitor, Tyson Foods. This suggests that the market is valuing JBS's stock at a lower multiple of its earnings, which could be an opportunity for a long-term investor who believes in the company's ability to return to higher profitability.
 * Cargill & National Beef: Two companies are privately held, which means their financial performance is not publicly disclosed. However, their presence is critical to understanding the oligopoly structure of the U.S. beef industry. The fact that the ""Big Four"" control 85% of the market is a key factor in JBS's long-term profitability.

Conclusion
The debate between the bull and bear case is a classic one. The optimal strategy is to synthesize both views and create a forward-looking plan that maximizes potential while mitigating risk. A recommended way forward is to:
Monitor the key catalyst 
A successful trade is based on a clear thesis and well-defined catalysts. The most important catalysts to monitor are:
 * The Cattle Herd: The USDA's forecasts for the US cattle herd are the most important metric to watch. A clear sign that the herd is beginning to grow would be a massive signal to the market.
 * The Global Business: Monitor the performance of JBS's other business segments. Continued profitability in poultry and pork would give confidence that the company can navigate the headwinds in its U.S. beef business.
 * Analyst Ratings: The recent ratings from JPMorgan and B of A  are pointing in the right direction. A sustained period of positive ratings and price targets would be a powerful signal that the market is finally coming around to a new way of thinking.
The Risk vs Reward
This trade is now a bet on a specific outcome, that the market will continue to re-rate JBS's stock to a valuation that is more in line with its long-term potential and peers

Forget Nvidia AI GPUs for a sec, I found the ultimate boomer stock with the most WSB energy imaginable: **Hillenbrand ($HI)**. Yeah, I know, sounds like a law firm or a casket company. Spoiler: it *was* a casket company. Now it makes boring plastic machines for Nestle and General Mills. Yup, exciting stuff.

So why should you care? Because some **private equity giga-chads (Apollo, Lone Star, Stellex)** are sniffing around like wolves at a nursing home buffet.

Here’s the kicker:

* EBITDA = \~$418M
* Normal boring industrial buyouts go for \~9–10× EBITDA
* Do the math: that’s a buyout price of \~$3.7–$4.0B EV → translates to about **$33–$36 per share**.
* Stock is sitting at $26.6. Bruh.

Now the fun part. Some **smart money lad yeeted $1.5M+ into $HI $30 calls expiring in November** right before close on Friday.

So we’ve got:

* Real buyers (Apollo don’t mess around).
* Real EBITDA math saying $33–36/share is the sweet spot.
* A PE bidding war.
* A random whale throwing $1.5M into illiquid calls like it’s a DraftKings parlay.

My dumb brain translation: either this dies in a ditch and we all lose money, or we get the juiciest $7–10/share tendie pop when a deal hits. My guess? **70% chance this goes through, 30% chance we’re bagholders crying into our Costco caskets**

So obivously, I YOLO'ed 50k into it. If you want exposure to *actual* smart money degeneracy instead of lotto scratchers on SPY weeklies, $HI might be the boomer rocket you never expected.

Based on my analysis target price: **$33–36**.  
Expiration date: **hopefully before our (at least mine) contracts do.**

TL;DR This company was killing it before tariff, still making a lot of things, all in the US of A. There's a bidding war and company will be acquired, I expect 7-8x EBITDA, so based on some sophisticated advanced complicated math, I think stocks will be at least $33 once it's announced or goes through.

Background: the stock selection is based on a multi factor model, and the option selection is even more complicated, but the spreads are simple vertical spreads so that if the stock is above the short strike the spread will be at max profit.

Tldr snap has begun and likely will continue to print.

I will be trading in and out for the next 6 months.





Adding dd here for context (dyor not financial advice etc etc)


Here's the thesis in short:

1. Snap went public at a 23 billion dollar valuation and had 404 million in revenue, now they are at a 14 billion dollar valuation and have 5.3 billion in revenue. 

2. They have a billion monthly active users, more than 12% of the world population.

3. They are making a push to permanent net profit, they launched a subscription model in 2022 (called Snapchat+), it's now at 700 million in revenue and grew 60% y/y in q1 2025 to 15 million users. Highly expect this to continue to grow at a tier 1 rate. (3 days ago they announced if you have more than 5gb of storage you'll pay $1.99 a month or can subscribe to snapchat+ for 3.99 a month, this should move the numbers too in a very strong way)

4. Evan wrote a letter to employees and shareholders a little while back, (I'm paraphrasing here) highlighting how he's not happy where the company is at, their competitors are all valued at 5x-100x them, and if they execute properly there could be startup like returns on their publicly traded stock

5. Their stock dropped at last earnings due to a technical one time error in their ad pricing software, this has been corrected and hasn't been priced into the stock. Stock is trading at a valuation that implies doom.


Oh and a Saudi prince buying up the company. (Now owns 2.5%)

1ns8te3,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 18:56:00,Follow up on my stock market journey,"Following up on my stock journey. About 6 months ago, I posted my portfolio gains at about 1200% in a little over 6-7 months. In about another 4-5 months time frame, I got the portfolio up to $80K and now back down to $74K.

Strategy is still the same and simple, buy low sell high. Obvious right?

Well, the biggest key strategy or let’s say mindset shift when I started winning is getting desensitized to money. Build a high conviction play, stick to it, DCA if it is lower and company stays the same, and don’t get stop lossed too early.

One of my biggest wins this year was UNH. It is a high value company, got some bad news and dropped like a rock. Market tends to OVERREACT ALWAYS and on either sides too. Bad news = overreact to the downside, then price rebounds to stabilize. Same way on the upside, good news = price surge overreaction and will correct to the range. I bought the dip at around $300 kept DCA to $290 and sold at $350. (I’m back in)

I also study macro trends, and market sentiment. Right now, market is ATH, overall sentiment is bullish HOWEVER, short term wise there is a lot of fear baked into the market. So, theoretically, if traders see big red candles, the downside pressure is higher. So I will be a bear and short most of the day if market is red, looks weak and I don’t see that V shape recovery that I usually see. (Indices did this past week)

I also study the price action, I don’t care about RSIs, MACD trends, etc those are all historical indicators. Nobody will know what the price will do next. But if you really take a look at the chart in one minute frame and study how it behaves: for example AMD, a lot of the time I noticed in the morning it shoots up 2-3%, market is not too bullish, I will scale in my puts because I know that there are no bullish news on AMD and that I notice that the price fades most of the time.

There are other strategies that I use, for example having QQQ SPY up with AMD, where QQQ will drop and AMD will drop in a delayed manner (30-60 seconds after) and might take advantage of that knowledge. A lot more to this, and can explain further.

Currently I am in BMNR and UNH as my two holdings, but unsure of market October. We were supposed to drop September and I feel as if market will drop October and rally into holiday season. But I don’t know that yet, need more data thus still in my positions long.

1nrvnxd,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 09:46:36,Upcoming OKLO Catalysts That Could Push It to $200+,"**TL;DR**: The biggest near-term catalysts for Oklo ($OKLO) are (1) Regulatory licensing filings with reduced fees now in effect, and (2) LOIs converting into binding PPAs with data centers/hyperscalers. DOE programs, insider alignment with Sam Altman/OpenAI, analyst coverage, and operational milestones round out the key drivers.

Disclaimer: This post is for informational purposes only and is not financial advice. It reflects analysis and opinions based on publicly available information, and any price targets or scenarios discussed are speculative. Investors should do their own research, consider their risk tolerance, and consult a licensed financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

⸻

**1. COL submission + reduced fees**:
The most important inflection would be Oklo submitting its Combined License (COL) or amendment under Part 52. A formal filing or acceptance letter moves the company onto a clear regulatory track toward construction/operation, reducing uncertainty and drawing institutional interest. Timing is favorable: as of Oct 1, the regulatory body lowered hourly rates for advanced reactor reviews, cutting licensing costs and making a filing even more attractive.

**2. LOIs → binding PPAs**:
Revenue visibility is the other big catalyst. Oklo already has public agreements and LOIs with data center operators (including a 12 GW framework with Switch). The next step is converting these into binding PPAs or project-level offtake contracts. If a hyperscaler or large operator signs a binding deal, it would instantly validate Oklo’s commercial model and likely re-rate the stock.

**3. DOE programs and pilot selection**:
Oklo has been selected under DOE pilot initiatives, and further DOE funding awards, pilot milestones, or fast-track inclusions would be visible de-risking events. Federal recognition both improves credibility and makes financing easier.

**4. Insider support (Sam Altman & OpenAI)**:
Filings show Sam Altman’s Hydrazine Capital still holds ~3.15M shares. Beyond that, Altman is also CEO of OpenAI, which has been clear about the massive energy requirements to scale AI compute. In a recent blog post, he said OpenAI will soon announce energy partnerships and new financing ideas. With his dual role and financial stake, Oklo is a logical partner candidate. Any announcement connecting the two would be a blockbuster catalyst.

**5. Analyst coverage shifts**:
Goldman Sachs recently initiated at $117 PT while others like Wedbush sit higher at $150+. Coverage from major desks matters because it shapes fund flows, especially if sentiment consolidates more bullish.

**6. Operational milestones**:
Incremental updates- site permits, readiness assessments, procurement contracts, or construction financing- are less flashy but reduce execution risk. Analysts track these closely, and they matter for building institutional confidence.

**7. Short-interest dynamics (secondary)**:
Borrow availability for OKLO has been tight at times, which means positive headlines can spark outsized moves. Serious investors usually don’t trade on this, but it helps explain volatility and is relevant for tactical positioning.

⸻

If Oklo successfully executes on its near-term milestones; including regulatory licensing, binding PPAs, and partnerships with entities like OpenAI- some analysts and investors suggest that a price target of **$200+** could be achievable, reflecting the company’s long-term growth potential in the nuclear energy sector.

[**Here’s**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/qp3BDzfZxs) my last post from 10 months ago, where I predicted that $OKLO would overtake $SMR in market capitalization.

1nrki5j,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 23:03:04,30k yolo call on OPEN,"I’ve got \~$30k in long calls on Opendoor ($OPEN). Here’s why I think this stock is positioned for both long-term growth and a potential market re-rating.

# 1. Undervalued Relative to Market

* **Market Cap:** \~$7B, which is tiny compared to the multi-trillion U.S. housing transaction market. Even a modest share of this market justifies a higher valuation.
* **Valuation:** Price-to-sales multiples remain compressed compared to other real estate tech players. If margins improve, OPEN has serious rerating potential.
* **Operations:** Risk management has improved, inventory exposure is down, and operating losses are narrowing. They’re not circling the drain - they’re stabilizing.

# 2. AI Integration Push

* CEO Kaz Nejatian recently sent out a company wide email regarding having employees have a more AI centric approach. (Can check his last X post)

* This suggests OPEN is evolving into a **data-driven housing platform**, not just a home-flipping company.
* Early adoption and daily AI use among employees show this is more than a PR move — it’s an operational shift.

# 3. Leadership Upgrade

* Kaz Nejatian is the new CEO, and this is a big deal. Before OPEN, he was COO at **Shopify**, where he played a key role in scaling one of the most successful e-commerce platforms of the past decade.
* Shopify stock went up around 600%+ during his time at Shopify.
* Strong, proven leadership is often overlooked in stock pricing but can dramatically improve execution and investor confidence.

# 4. Why Now

* **Technical Setup:** Chart has broken out of consolidation, with momentum building.
* **Macro:** Housing headwinds are well known and arguably priced in. Even stabilization could trigger sentiment reversal.
* **Catalysts:** New CEO narrative, AI integration, and upcoming earnings are all potential positive triggers.

**Conclusion:**  
$OPEN looks mispriced for what it’s becoming: a leaner, AI-powered housing platform with a strong CEO who has scaled complex businesses before. With improved operations and a push into tech-driven growth, this is a value play with real upside.

**TL;DR:**

* \~$7B market cap vs. multi-trillion housing market = undervalued.
* AI integration = real operational advantage compared to other real-estate companies.
* New CEO Kaz Nejatian (ex-Shopify COO) = strong leadership.
* Long-term bullish — I’m in with \~$30k calls.

About 3 weeks ago I made a play on $CRWV $105 calls when it was sitting around $98 and posted here about it. That move ended up being a 10 bagger when it shot up all the way to $120.

  
I see another huge opportunity on $CRWV now. This stock is one of the backbones of the AI cloud computing play. There was just a monster dip on literally zero news, so I'm betting hard on a rebound next week. 

  
They keep racking up monster deals with big players in the AI space, and spend on cloud compute isn't going anywhere anytime soon. I foresee a run to $135+ next week.

UiPath has been working on robotic process automation since 2021 and getting nowhere fast. Down \~80% and been there since 2022. Wrong product and wrong time.

Then they figured out that LLM's exist and made Maestro. Maestro will do what Palantir's Foundry does but for business admin people who are not SAP programming experts. Maestro is software that will automate Gen X's enterprise needs. Thrilling, I know. But they have a partnership with Microsoft, they beat earnings consistently. their YoY customer retention is great, and they say 'agentic ai' a lot. So calls obviously.

If you want more thorough DD, check out NYCandrun's post earlier this month. Revenue from Maestro most likely won't show up on their Q3 earnings, but in case it does I have January 2026 calls and January 2027 leaps.

And at that point I knew there was something up with the Nebius chart that I had to do DD on. 

And then I realized the it was like when Sword Art Online came out. It was off to a good start then fell off season 2, which is why the chart declined. 

Then we see star symbols of waifs. I can't read Japanese, but I know it's cute. So stock price went up. 

Then it got replaced when demon slayer came out. the movie was great. And that's when we get serious with the TA. Tanjiro's hairline is spotted on the 1 month chart. That means it does have something to do with Demon Slayer. And because if we analyze the macro environment of the spike of Nezuko Body pillows by 80% after the Demon Slayer movie, we should also see a 80% spike in WEebius group.

Tanjiro always gets up after he gets beaten up, which is just manic character anime plot armor. Even despite a drop today, NBIUS will keep getting back up and going up because it's overpowered. There might have been some resistance because of weed haters, but we should follow body pillow sales, not what other people think.

AI runs on GPUs, right? RIGHT?

The answer is it depends. And most people (including developers) don't know that, but they will know, eventually

Let's begin with memory bandwidth from now on BW

Each token generation requires accessing ALL model weights, that means for each output token you need to load the entire model so how fast you load that model in memory, for that bw was the major limitation of CPUs ultill the next gen

The current top xeon has 0.614TB/s which is a ton, and could be working on dual configuration with 6TB RAM at 1,7TB/s but Top GPUs like A100 have 2TB/s and H100 has 3TB/s, the next generation of Intel Xeon 18A is expected to have \~2TB/s. Positioning near A100.

BW tl;dr: \*\*Usually doubling bandwidth roughly doubles token generation speed  
BW deepdive:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is\_inferencing\_memory\_bandwidth\_limited/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is_inferencing_memory_bandwidth_limited/)



Let's keep going, usually big chunk papa models cannot and will not work on a CPU period, but advances in quantization(from now on Q\_) made possible to run big papa models like gpt-oss 120b run on a CPU with a loss in accuracy near to 2%

Usually models are based on 16B and Q\_ down to 8 or 4, each time you half the number of bits, it halves the model size. For example GPT-OSS could run Q\_8 with only 60GB what makes possible to run at any modern workstation CPU RAM. You have 2 modules of 32GB DDR5? Boom you can run Q\_ big papa models

Q\_ tl;dr: CPUs can run big models on RAM now

Q\_ deepdive: [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/)

[https:\/\/developer.nvidia.com\/blog\/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization\/](https://preview.redd.it/xjqr7wqojcrf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b50372aec5d17a684cfa3882534067d4bd58844)

Let's talk about money, while a GPU is the king and surpasses the CPU in every metric possible, CPUs are crazy energy efficient and versatile, but what does it mean? It means that server providers are more prone to buy a CPU because they have a wider set of applications, and not only inference so they can have less idle time and more money back from their chips, since we discussed earlier, not everyone needs the biggest model available and token generation speed in new Xeon processors with CPU tokens per second sucks vs GPU they are not even close, but! Look at performance:

[https:\/\/www.nscale.com\/blog\/cpu-inferencing-why-not](https://preview.redd.it/8h79t8kqjcrf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3f3f23a5491adf4064be81e5af3be9a53dd86c)

Oh boy, you can bet small to mid-sized businesses are going to notice this, since this graph is not suitable for large environments where inference is handled by a cluster using vLLM or other software that allows load distribution and pipeline parallelism.

And they are not only crazy efficient but Intel is positioning at the most competitive chips for LLM inference per dollar:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel\_6944p\_the\_most\_cost\_effective\_cpu\_solution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel_6944p_the_most_cost_effective_cpu_solution/)

Lastly, the necessity of private LLM execution for small and mid-sized businesses is a niche that perfectly meets CPU inference.

[https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/](https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/)

On top of all of this, Intel and NVIDIA reached an agreement which announcement literally says: ""For data centers, Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market.""  
[https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products](https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products)  
So you can bet every board in a data center that works with Nvidia will have an Intel-manufactured CPU, which means that NVIDIA could be one of the first clients of the new Foundries that could be followed by other manufacturers and fabless chip designers.

tl;dr: buy intel

I know this position is risky, I might roll but this is why I’m here:

The idea is simple: insiders are loading up right as the company locks in real LNG growth and heads into winter. In the last week directors filed multiple open-market buys: William Vrattos purchased 100,000 shares at a weighted average $6.864, Edward Andrew Scoggins Jr. bought 15,000 shares around $6.46, and a separate Form 4 shows director Jason Dillow’s purchase disclosed on Sept 18–19. These are actual “P” code buys, not grants, and total seven figures of fresh skin in the game.

Why now matters. On Sept 9 NextDecade reached positive FID and financial close on Rio Grande LNG Train 4, and management guided that Train 5’s FID is expected before Nov 15 after recently signing a 1.5 MTPA, 20 year SPA with EQT for Train 5 volumes. Winter gas demand historically tightens the LNG tape, and sector prints like Sempra’s Port Arthur Phase 2 FID this week underscore that U.S. LNG build-out is still accelerating into year end.

The setup is that real project de-risking plus visible commercial deals plus unusually large insider buying can force a rerate from distressed expectations. With shares around the mid-$7s today, the near-term upside case is straightforward: Train 5 financing headlines or additional SPAs into winter could be the next leg while insider conviction anchors the floor. Size it like a volatile mid-cap LNG developer and respect headline risk, but the combination of fresh director money, new FIDs, and contracted volumes is exactly the kind of catalyst stack that can keep propelling this higher.",573,184,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nptl01,new,DD,0.92

1npru94,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 19:48:15,"Is Gold Overbought Or Is There Still More Upside Left? Here's Our
Simple Technical Analysis and Thoughts.","Gold is now at $3760ish at the time of this post and holding, but is the momentum going to continue, or will we see a pause in the price movement upwards? Having been a Precious Metals Analyst since 2005, here are my thoughts...

I think this recent bull market in gold started once it cleared $2100 and broke out to the upside, which happened in March of 2024, mostly from Central Bank buying and investor demand. Since then, it's been on a gradual ascent upwards with some pauses and consolidations before making the next leg higher. At the beginning of this year, the US started bringing lots of gold from London (LBMA) and shipping it to the US, let's say at a price of about $2800-$3000. This is something I haven't seen in 20 years, so I think that puts a floor on the price of Gold at $3000, I don't think we will ever see gold under $3000 ever again, unless we get a MAJOR BlackSwan event and total all markets liquidation, and even then, that $3000 price of gold could hold as the floor.

So, currently at $3750, can gold continue higher to $4000? Yes, I think so. The rate drop cycle that has started in the US is one of the factors that caused gold to break out of the $3300-$3400 consolidation price range this summer. If we get more interest rate drops, I think Gold goes to $4000, based on this alone, but how much further it goes beyond that is yet to be seen. I would be happy with $4000 on gold in the next few months, or maybe into early next year.

There is a seasonality to gold price movements, but since the beginning of 2024, it hasn't followed the normal patterns, and I think that's because this new bull market started then, and probably has many more years ahead of us. But once the interest rate drop cycle ends, gold will have peaked out and may retrace back to major uptrend support lines, and consolidate for the next major move, up or down.

These are just some of my initial thoughts, and I will continue to pop in on this REDDIT once and awhile to share more thoughts and updates if people here are interested. ",0,43,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/dlg1dqxx87rf1.png,new,Discussion,0.37

1npnj6l,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 16:45:36,NVTS Navitas Semiconductor Run Incoming (NVDA Blackwell),"I’m picking NVTS for AI and Data Center Expansion. Basically this is a company specializing in next-generation power semiconductors, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) technologies. These are used in high-growth areas like AI data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), mobile charging, and renewable energy.

•  NVTS eyeing revival through NVIDIA AI synergies—volume’s solid, but P/E flags caution. Buybacks could turbocharge if fundamentals align; divested $100M+ last year signals pivot potential.

•  Risk-reward tightening.. Upside from scale-ups and partnerships; downside on costs/delays.

•  Pre-market buzz tied to EV/AI tailwinds—partnership expansions and earnings guidance in focus.

•  Shares breaking 50-day MA on volume—technical setup for extension if momentum holds.

•  Despite revenue dip, EV/semi growth narrative intact—optimism hinges on delivery.

Not financial advice, DYOR, but if AI infrastructure bottlenecks persist (hello, NVIDIA Blackwell), NVTS could be the under-the-radar winner. At the current price, I’d say the room to run is to $16 after $9 breaks. We saw this on APLD. This narrative is the play.

Q3 earnings Nov 3 could spotlight AI progress; ECCE and WiPDA conferences in Oct/Nov for tech showcases; CES 2026 prep might drop EV bombshells via VREMT. Recent manufacturing ramps and CEO shakeup already juiced the stock 40% on news. I’m in for 700 shares already. When I hit 10K it’ll be a YOLO.

This stock has been pumping harder than Elon at an earnings call, but every rocket runs out of fuel. Earnings + macro + overextension = setup for a rug pull.

If Tesla slides under $400, I print. If it nukes back to $372–$361 breakeven, I’m sure retiring with my tendies.

6 YEARSS OF PAIN AND MENTAL TORTURE.

Bought 100 contracts 130C on 8/12/24 with 12/19/25 Expiry. Sold before today’s pop :( and they’re worth $52ish last I checked but whatever.

Honestly I wish I never found this sub, I can’t remember the last time I didn’t file the 3k loss on my taxes. I just kept putting money into random options while scouring this sub.

At the worst point I had lost 120k of my own hard earned money. Throughout the years I had made the money back through some crazy WSB plays (GymeStonk, Iron net, etc) and within a couple days I’d be back to a huge loss. 

I finally started looking for value plays with LEAPS and my biggest option play were these BABA calls. I bought them with a year and a half DTE with half of my account value. For some reason I wanted to hold for at least a year because I had a feeling and here we are. It was hard to stomach the ups and down constantly but it paid off.
I think I’m done for a long time, I keep checking Robinhood for my next play out of habit but I think I’m going to delete the app after withdrawing it all. I put most of my BP in SGOV for now for dividends.

My advice: If you’re young and naive and lurking in this sub, don’t start trading options, I honestly got lucky. Maybe use a small percentage of your income for risky plays but not your entire investing budget like I did.

Thanks regards, I learned a lot from this sub and maybe I’ll be back in a couple of years but for now, goodbye and good luck.",627,67,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1npfnze,new,Gain,0.96

Since I posted my last bullish thesis some crazy stuff happened, notably the DoD discovered that they couldn’t solely rely on SpaceX and Elmo because when he’s on his periods dude just goes  nuts 🌰

This fact alone serves as an insurance policy for Neutron’s future, ensuring it becomes instantly essential for the DoD

But if this is not enough here is a list of catalysts coming Rocket Lab way by end of year, 

Possible wins over contracts : 

- SDA (different layers) worth $500M+
- Mars Telecom Orbiter worth $700M 
- Mars Sample Return worth $4B 
- Golden Dome contracts (total project will be $175B+) 

Company catalysts : 

- Neutron on the pad 
- New Neutron commercial contracts 
- Neutron launch 
- EBITDA > 0 

Neutron is a structural change within the company that will bring Billions in revenue over the years, couple it with the current market conditions and it gives you rocket fuel 🥁 for one of the best positioned company of the next 10+ years

1np10yv,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 22:47:55,Just bought TTD,"I saw a DD here on TTD a few days ago and decided to jump in. They are the market leader in what they do. Some will say it’s overvalued. Well, in my experience market doesn’t run on overvalued or undervalued, only on emotions. 
Price seems pretty low currently so I bought in.

The Trade Desk (TTD) continues to demonstrate its strength as a long-term investment in the evolving digital advertising space. The company’s robust demand-side platform enables advertisers to manage and optimize data-driven campaigns across various channels, including connected TV (CTV)—a segment growing rapidly as traditional TV declines. CEO Jeff Green has previously stated, “We process more transactions in one day than Visa does in a year,” underscoring the scale and efficiency of their real-time bidding architecture. TTD’s platform is built on transparency and independence, positioning it well against walled gardens like Google and Meta.

Institutional confidence in TTD is also rising. Notably, Intech Investment Management LLC boosted its stake by over 5,700%, Los Angeles Capital Management LLC initiated a $68.6 million position, and ARK Invest (Cathie Wood) recently added 210,664 shares (~$29.5M) to its ARKW fund. LaFleur & Godfrey LLC and several others have also increased exposure. These large bets from respected hedge funds signal strong conviction in TTD’s scalability and future cash flow.

Given its proven leadership, deep industry integration, and consistent innovation in programmatic ad tech, TTD is well-positioned for long-term growth—especially as advertisers shift more spend toward measurable, real-time channels like CTV.

Not a professional, and never made a DD before, but it still feels like space and Nuclear are on a roll of sorts, and have more to come in the future. Maybe buying into RYCEY right now is worth a shot?

\[FINAL UPDATE: Sold out for \~5% profit after 8 days\]

Options were kinda expensive on this one so I didn't think they were underpriced. Being said - lots of shit / potential catalysts around this one that I am unsure if market has priced in yet. Look at all NVDA's recent partnerships (OpenAI in particular - I'm looking at you). I believe micron provides the memory for nvidia GPU's and it may have potential to go brr. Dunno - it's an ER play. I actually don't really know what these guys do to be honest, just lots of chatter & I blindly trusted chat. I'm likely rotating out of micron within a week. These were bought this morning as I rotated out of $SNAP calls. I didn't like how options were priced on this one so monkeyed into shares instead.

It's already ran 40% last month, so high risk. I love buying the top.

Goodluck to all in the cino

\[Update\] Literally flat. Boring. My call about options being overpriced was correct, these are up \~0.5% if AH holds tomorrow. Glad I bought shares & didn't play options here. Theta gang printing tho. I'm up like 5-10k on the AH movement. Theta gang & shares won this one.

\[Update 2\] Might make like 1.5-2% on these tomorrow. Seems to be trending upwards. Lots of people bullish in the other threads - suggesting a hold is an alright bet. My read about overpriced vol seems to be correct tho - options are not the play on this one. I'll update chat when I exit. Goodluck to all.

1nolrsv,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 12:17:08,$SNAP - Final update. Rolled all options profits into shares (20k share freeroll),"Same shit I did on my other plays. I trade options which I believe are underpriced, tend to very quickly take profits (usually in < 2 weeks, despite the fact I'm trading leaps) and roll profits into the underlying. IE: $SNAP. IMO this one is likely to run over 10 after the next ER's (the drop was due to a bug in their advertising platform). I stand by my previous investment + DD.

My trading style involves using leaps / far expiration options for risk mitigation (ie: if my thesis is wrong - I can just keep holding / re-evaluate) & to leverage my bets. This one made me \~16-18% in a week, which is a fantastic return IMO. I got a 20k snap share freeroll out of it - which IMO should pay very well. I don't like following things long term with options, so just hold shares on things I previously followed.

For evidence of risk mitigation - look at my history for how I played GTLB. I bought before ER's and they ate a -12% overnight (while I was long OTM calls). I woke up to a \~25% unrealized loss. I held for 2 weeks and managed to sell for a \~5% profit - as I re-evaluated risk matrix after the drop & decided it was positive EV to continue to hold.

I only follow a few tickers at once & never went broke from taking profits. Rotating my trading capital elsewhere into another (imo) undervalued thing. There's a few on my radar.

Secretary of Defense, Hegseth’s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no brainer. 

The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies. It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports.

""While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,"" Hegseth said in the video online. ""Not anymore.""

The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by ""approving hundreds of American products"" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a ""variety of low-cost drones"" made by American engineers and AI experts.

The order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use.

""Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,"" the memo said.

Lastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars.

""Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,"" Hegseth wrote in the memo.

The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace.

As of their recent Town Hall announcement, RedCat has finally received the green light from the Army to announce LRIP (Low Rate Initial Production) portion of the SRR contract. Announcing 690 systems rather previous 550. Their guidance for fiscal year is 80-120M projected to hit 55M for Q3 this year. Today, they announced their first delivery of 45 systems for a total of $3.5M. We did the numbers and it took them approximately 3.4 days to deliver 45 drones, which indicates they can easily produce, deliver and execute. 

Following news today, RedCat’s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat’s drones. 

They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options

TLDR: Drone warfare is here. American drone dominance is here. Plan to outpace China which means $$$$$ for drone industry. RedCat won SRR contract beating 30+ competitors for it. Meeting the supply demand for the contract. 
Has connections to current administration. Approved for NATO.

Genius Sports (GENI) – Equity Research Report

Rating: Buy | Price Target: $40/share

Company Overview
Genius Sports is a leading provider of official sports data, video, and media technology services. It operates in three segments: Betting Technology & Services, Media Technology & Services, and Sports Technology & Services. Its core business revolves around delivering low-latency, official data feeds, integrity solutions, and media/ad-tech solutions to sportsbooks, leagues, and advertisers.

Industry Structure: The Duopoly
The global sports data industry has consolidated into a duopoly between Genius Sports and Sportradar. Most top-tier leagues have signed official rights contracts with one of these two players.
This grants both companies pricing power, sticky multi-year contracts, and significant barriers to entry. Sportradar's acquisition of IMG Arena and Genius Sports' extended NFL exclusive rights through 2030 reinforce this structure.

Catalyst: December 3, 2025 Investor Day
On December 3, 2025, Genius Sports will host its Investor Day in New York City. The company will demonstrate its product suite, growth strategy, and financial outlook. Investors are expected to gain a clearer understanding of the depth, breadth, and strength of Genius’ rapidly growing Media segment, guided to grow at least 60% YoY in 2H-2025. The Investor Day will likely highlight product demos, fan intelligence capabilities (via the Sports Innovation Lab acquisition), and advertising integrations, which may catalyze investor confidence and support valuation re-rating.

Media Business Growth
Genius’ Media business, driven by FANHub, ad-tech integrations, and fan intelligence tools, is the fastest-growing part of the company. With ~60% YoY growth guided for H2-2025, management aims to establish Media as a core driver of margin expansion. This segment is expected to mature into a higher-margin, software-like business, improving Genius’ overall profitability profile.

Why Genius Sports and Sportradar Are the Visa & Mastercard of Sports Betting
• Two-Sided Networks: They connect leagues (rights owners) with sportsbooks/media operators,similar to how Visa/Mastercard connect merchants and cardholders.
• Mission-Critical Infrastructure: Official live data feeds are indispensable for in-play betting, just as cardrails are essential for commerce.
• Duopoly Resilience: Like Visa and Mastercard, two scaled networks coexist globally, ensuringredundancy and pricing balance.
• Embedded Growth: Both are layering new services (media, AI, video) like Visa/Mastercard layeredfraud prevention, cross-border fees, and loyalty.
• High Switching Costs: Sportsbooks cannot risk losing official feeds, echoing merchants’ dependenceon card networks.
Path to $40/share
GENI trades around $12.79 today. To reach $40 (~$10B equity value), the company must scale revenue from ~$645M in 2025 to ~$1.2–1.3B by 2027–2028, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to 25–30% or more. That would yield ~$350–$400M EBITDA. At a premium 25x EV/EBITDA multiple, supported by duopoly economics and rapid Media growth, GENI’s valuation aligns with $40/share.

Exhibit: GENI Share Price Bridge to $40

Risks
• Rights renewal risk: leagues may demand higher economics or switch providers.
• Ad-market cyclicality could slow Media growth if brand budgets decline.
• Competitive pressure from Sportradar or new entrants in specific markets.
• Regulatory risks affecting betting, advertising, or data usage.
Conclusion
Genius Sports and Sportradar stand as the two strongest business models in the global sports betting industry, analogous to Visa and Mastercard in payments. Both firms benefit from scale, rights exclusivity, and embedded network effects. With rapid Media growth, a clear duopoly, and the upcoming December 2025 Investor Day as a catalyst, we see GENI’s path to $40/share as realistic within 2–3 years. We assign a Buy rating with a $40/share price target.",26,35,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/qa3n1w0nhuqf1.jpeg,new,YOLO,0.81

1nnr3mg,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 12:24:18,YOLO $600k+ speculation on MUX as Barrick M&A target,"Commodities like gold, silver, and uranium have the sex appeal for investors doing moon math on free cash flow from rising commodity prices. However, looking at the strategic focus of mining majors, they are in love with copper, especially supermassive, cheap copper porphyry deposits up in the Andes in newly liberalized Argentina. Case in point is the recent Teck+Anglo merger, a harbinger of M&A to come in the copper space.

Most of the juicy Andes copper deposits have been taken by the Lundin clan, but MUX has one remaining supermassive copper project in Los Azules. Doing napkin math on Los Azules economics at current copper prices gets a NPV that suggests MUX's Los Azules stake easily exceeds the enterprise value of MUX, not counting McEwen's substantial though mediocre gold mining operations.

https://preview.redd.it/fjp6nir5qqqf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb2c56e12b8146accf6099bcaa23e1c941cffa6

I see Barrick as most likely acquirer given their existing operations in the same San Juan province of Argentina, given their nearby Veladero JV with Shandong Gold. Most of their operational/regulatory know-how readily translates out to building Los Azules. In my eye, the Los Azules dream team would be Barrick as operator, and Shandong Gold/Rio Tinto/McEwen Mining as minority equity partners given operational, technological, and exploration expertise on the Los Azules geology. In my calculation, Barrick could plausibly build out Los Azules with fronting just a couple hundred million of project equity with these partners, writing a royalty to FNV/WPM, and taking reasonable levels of project debt.

The other potential operator is Rio Tinto who is already on the Los Azules cap table. While Rio has nearby Argentina operations, they are in the Salta province and their workforce/operational knowledge is less readily translatable to Los Azules.

MUX has a long-awaited technical report on Los Azules coming out next month. It has been delayed a couple times, and my read of the delays is that they are due to scope creep, i.e. positive surprises that necessitate further exploration/testing than originally envisioned. MUX has verbally indicated plans for an IPO of the stake and potentially building out the project themselves, but IMO this is just positioning/angling for stronger hand in M&A negotiations. Either way, once that technical report comes out, I believe the stock can move very quickly.

Wish me luck as I have a degenerately large portfolio fraction on this bet. I plan to hold options into year end and may trade in and out of shares.

**Disclaimer: This is purely my own speculation with no confirmations, my napkin math has been very wrong in the past. I am not an investment professional, this is not investment advice.**

* Skywater (SKYT) is a special company. It’s a US semiconductor manufacturer sitting at the intersection of two secular themes: (1) Domestic, trusted supply of US military chips, and (2) picks and shovels exposure to quantum computing.

**Core defense/specialty foundry (\~80% of revenue)**

* Skywater is one of 12 DMEA category 1-A trusted foundries certified to supply chips to the US DoD. For those of you too lazy to look up what that means, this is basically the Fort Knox of chip fabs, and it’s hard to get. Unlike peers embedded in large conglomerates (BAE, Raytheon, ON), **SKYT is one of the ONLY public pureplays on US military chip fabrication**.

**SKYT has two important facilities:**

* Florida advanced packaging: the DoD awarded SKYT $120mm (with options up to $190mm) to build this out. It is trusted & accredited and almost ready to start ramping. Outputs will be used in **drones, electronic warfare, guided munitions, and space avionics.**
* Austin fab: this was owned by Infineon and SKYT is acquiring it. It was not “trusted” before, but under Skywater, it will be. It previously specialized in industrial/auto end markets, but now will be eligible to supply chips for **drones, satellites, missiles, and comms gear.**

**Quantum & Photonics (\~20% of revenue)**

* Donald mentioned the word “quantum” 5 times in his speech with Starmer last week. The hype cycle is in full swing. And Skywater is the classic picks and shovels play.
* While every PhD with a powerpoint is burning through VC cash\*\*, Skywater is one of the only companies actually getting paid\*\*.  They provide essential foundry services and photonics platforms that quantum players need for their chips and devices. Management has called out double digit y/y growth, and if quantum really takes off, this business could hockey stick.

**Policy Tailwinds & Strategic Importance**

* The CEO, Thomas Sonderman, has been busy in Washington. Just earlier this month he was seen at the White House with top brass, including Michael Kratsios, the Chief Technology Officer of the United States. Kratsios is responsible for crafting the US quantum strategy (photos attached).
   * [Michael J.K Kratsios - Department of War Bio](https://www.war.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/2279091/michael-jk-kratsios/)
* SKYT is already in the club. They’re pre-vetted and pre-funded. Next up could be CHIPs grants, new DoD IDIQs/OTAs, and though a long shot, maybe even a direct government equity check.

**Why Now?**

* “Quantum” is getting publicity at the highest levels. Attention = budgets.
* SKYT’s Florida facility is nearly ready to ramp. This probably means some big DoD orders are on the way. They paid for it after all. 
* At today’s market cap, you’re buying a critical part of the US defense/quantum supply chain at a total bargain. 

**TLDR:** $SKYT is a tiny company with a license to print money from the Pentagon. They are one of the only pureplays building ""Made in the USA"" chips for the military. They are also the picks and shovels play for the quantum computing industry, collecting tolls from whoever wins. Technology. Skywater already has a seat at the table and is Chummy with DOD Pals.

**Position:** Nov/Dec/Jan $20 Call

1nmucye,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 11:05:40,The Federal Reserve’s Dual Mandate Is Outdated And The Data Used For Decisions Are Wrong. A Better Approach From Escorts.,"The Fed claims to balance price stability with maximum employment. In practice, both pillars are built on sand:

Job creation data is constantly revised downward... the latest BLS revision wiped out 911,000 jobs like a bad typo.

The unemployment rate is essentially fan fiction. It counts gig workers, Uber drivers, OnlyFans creators, and yes, technically even escorts, prostitutes, hookers, and strippers as “employed.”

Inflation at “3%” is a joke. My grocery bill, rent, and utilities all disagree.

The truth is, the economy runs on a far more honest set of forces: men’s disposable income to spend on sex work and women’s willingness to sell companionship.

So I propose a new, more accurate Dual Mandate for the Federal Reserve:

1. Balance the number of men who can still afford escorts, prostitutes, hookers, strippers, and sugar babies.

2. Balance the number of women entering sex work out of economic necessity.


Here’s the model:

Bad economy: More women enter the industry due to lack of alternatives while men cut back on spending

Good economy: Fewer women stay in sex work since they have better alternatives; men who can afford it spend more


Forget CPI. The true measure of inflation is the Escort Asking Rate Index (EARI™) a basket of advertised rates across cities. If her hourly goes up, it’s because her rent, groceries, and Uber rides went up. That’s a real-time, boots-on-the-ground measure of cost of living.

So if you want price stability and full employment? Look no further than the front page of Tryst and Seeking instead of opaque & confusing calculations done by economists

As a future Fed official, I’ll ensure every FOMC meeting includes a robust discussion of escort pricing trends before setting interest rates. Powell had his dot plot. I’ll have my thot plot.

1nm46mr,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 13:28:14,I learned my lesson,"For 16 months I ran after every shitty rumor. Lost money on every pump and dump. Put cash in companies that crashed 60–90% in days (sometimes minutes). Panic-sold. Always too late. Missed the big bull runs.

Then I thought: this can’t go on. I dumped the trash, even when losses were small (or rumors were intense) and gave some stupid hope. That freed up my margin. I threw all the capital into major companies. Not just M7, but well spread out. Caught the rebounds of CRWD and SNPS — made real wins. Sold covered calls that actually made sense: smaller premiums, way less risk. Grabbed puts to lock down my biggest plays.

Result: A few days later, +50%. Haven’t seen numbers like that in over a year.

1nm0a5q,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 10:54:22,Huge Micron Bet,"Hey everyone,

First time with a DD so forgive me if I sound regarded. 

This is the biggest trade I am set up for and wanted to share my thoughts. 

I believe we are going to see a huge run up next Tuesday with Microns earnings call. Current price is $162 with the pull back with Samsungs announcement spooking the market but I believe this won’t affect Microns future capabilities with HBM.  

So Micron Q4 earnings are coming up… and I’m bullish. I took up a huge position with the underlying prior to the pump on Thursday. 

Yesterday with the drop I loaded up at the bottom on 200 calls $175 expiring October 17. 

My logic is this. 

Seeing what happened with Oracle over their guidance gives me confident we may expect something crazy from Micron, especially when their customers Nvidia, Amd, Microsoft, Amazon, Google all had record years. All of them just crushed it on AI and cloud growth.

If they’re winning, Micron is too. Every GPU and every data center relies on Micron’s memory to run. While there are 2 main competitors in the memory landscape (Samsung and SK Hynix) I believe Micron is well positioned regardless. 

Last quarter: $9.3B in revenue with nearly 50% growth in high-bandwidth memory sales.

Next up: Management is guiding ~$10.7B for Q4 with stronger margins. I think they may beat expectations. 

In all of the last 5 reported fiscal quarters listed above, Micron has beaten EPS expectations.  ￼

The beat amounts range from ~+$0.13 to ~+$0.34 in recent quarters.

The most recent (Q3 FY2025) was the largest beat in that sample, +$0.34

However with this upcoming Q4 FY 2025, EPS consensus estimates are around $2.78-$2.86 per share. Year-over-year that’s a big jump from ~$1.18 in Q4 FY2024.  ￼
	
Gross margin expectations have been revised up, reflecting tight supply + improved pricing (especially DRAM).

Analyst Quotes & Price Targets

Wedbush (Matt Bryson) – PT $200

“Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson raised the firm’s price target on Micron Technology to $200 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm notes that demand from cloud service providers has come in stronger than expected, which could significantly boost Micron’s future sales and pricing power. Wedbush believes that the ongoing AI build-out is creating a structural uplift in demand for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory that will continue through 2026.” 【Barron’s】

Barclays – PT $175

“Barclays analysts raised their Micron target price to $175 from about $140, while maintaining an Overweight rating. The analysts acknowledged that some of the recent NAND chip orders coming out of Silicon Valley may be short-term in nature, but they believe Micron will likely exceed its current guidance. They also expect the company to offer a strong forward outlook as hyperscaler spending on AI infrastructure continues at an aggressive pace.” 【Barron’s】

Deutsche Bank (Melissa Weathers) – PT $175

“Deutsche Bank analyst Melissa Weathers lifted her price target on Micron shares from $155 to $175, reiterating a Buy rating. She noted that favorable market conditions for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory, particularly products tied to artificial intelligence data centers, are a major driver of upside. Weathers added that DRAM pricing has remained firm, supply is constrained, and demand for HBM in GPUs and servers is accelerating faster than the Street had anticipated.” 【Investors.com】

Mizuho (Vijay Rakesh) – PT $182

“Mizuho Securities raised its price target on Micron to $182 and kept a Buy rating. Analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote that momentum around artificial intelligence and strong demand for high-bandwidth memory should continue to drive Micron’s results higher. He cited tight supply in both DRAM and NAND, with pricing moving upward, as well as Micron’s increasing share of AI-focused products. Rakesh emphasized that Micron is one of the few companies positioned to deliver both volume growth and margin expansion in this environment.” 【MarketWatch】

UBS (Timothy Arcuri) – PT $185

“UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised Micron’s price target to $185 and reiterated a Buy rating. Arcuri pointed to confidence in DRAM and HBM supply tightness and sustained AI-related growth as the core reasons for the higher target. He noted that Micron’s technology roadmap has been executing well and that the company is positioned to capture outsized share of the high-performance memory demand wave driven by Nvidia, AMD, and hyperscalers.” 【PriceTargets.com】

Susquehanna – PT $200

“Susquehanna Financial upgraded its Micron target to $200, keeping a Positive rating. Analysts cited tightening DRAM and NAND supply, improving average selling prices across memory, and accelerating AI adoption as reasons to expect Micron’s earnings power to surprise to the upside. The firm believes current Street estimates remain too low given the structural tailwinds in AI-centric workloads.” 【PriceTargets.com】

JPMorgan (Harlan Sur) – PT $185

“JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised Micron’s price target to $185 from $160 and kept an Overweight rating. Sur highlighted upside to revenue, gross margin, and earnings in the near term, driven by better-than-expected pricing across multiple end-markets including AI data centers, smartphones, and personal computers. He said the company is likely to announce November-quarter guidance that comes in solidly ahead of consensus expectations. JPMorgan believes Micron’s HBM3E ramp and DRAM cost reductions are ahead of schedule, which will further support earnings acceleration.” 【Benzinga】

Rosenblatt Securities (Kevin Cassidy) – PT $200

“Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy reaffirmed a Buy rating on Micron and boosted the firm’s target to $200. Cassidy wrote that Micron could report a modest beat to its preannounced results, but the real story will be the outlook. He expects Micron’s November-quarter guidance may come in much higher than consensus estimates of $11.8 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.00. Cassidy emphasized that constrained DRAM and NAND Flash wafer supply through at least 2026, alongside accelerating demand from AI workloads, positions Micron for outsized profitability.” 【Benzinga】

Zacks Investment Research – Avg PT $155.59 (Range $75–$200)

“Zacks recently upgraded Micron from Hold to Strong Buy, giving the stock a Zacks Rank #1. Their analysts cite accelerating demand for DRAM and NAND, stronger-than-expected revenue in AI/data center markets, and consistent earnings surprises as the drivers. Zacks’ consensus 12-month price target from ~34 analysts is $155.59, with estimates ranging from as low as $75 to as high as $200. They highlight Micron’s strong Growth and Momentum scores, though its Value score is weaker given the higher multiples.” 【Zacks / MarketBeat】

Micron Management Quotes & Context

“Micron’s strong competitive position and solid execution delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, with revenue, gross margin and EPS all exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges.” — Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO.  ￼

“Data center revenue more than doubled year over year and reached a record level, and consumer-oriented markets had strong sequential growth.” — Mehrotra.  ￼
	
“We generated substantial free cash flow in the quarter, even as we continue to make strategic investments critical to sustain long term growth.” — Mehrotra.  ￼
	
“Micron delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, driven by all-time-high DRAM revenue including nearly 50% sequential growth in HBM revenue.” — Mehrotra.  ￼

“We are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025, while we invest to build on our leadership to address growing AI-driven memory demand.” — Mehrotra.  ￼

“Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $7.1 billion, up 51% year over year, and represented 76% of total revenue. Sequentially, DRAM revenue increased 15%, with bit shipments increasing over 20% and prices decreasing in the low single-digit percentage range, primarily due to a higher consumer-oriented revenue mix.” — Mark Murphy, CFO.  ￼

“NAND revenue was $2.2 billion … Sequentially, NAND revenue increased 16%, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-20s percentage range and prices decreasing in the high single-digit percentage range.” — Murphy.  ￼

“Gross margin … was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better prices for both DRAM and NAND, partially offset by a higher consumer-oriented mix.” — CFO Murphy.  ￼
	
“Ending inventory for fiscal Q3 was $8.7 billion, or 139 days. Inventory was down $280 million sequentially, and inventory days were down 19 days sequentially, driven by strong sequential bit shipment growth in both DRAM and NAND.” — Murphy.  ￼
	
Guidance for Q4:
“We expect revenue of $10.7 billion ± $300 million; gross margin non-GAAP of ~42% ± 1%; operating expenses approx $1.2 billion ± $20 million; non-GAAP EPS of ~$2.50 ± $0.15 per share.” — Micron management.  ￼

“With another quarter of shipment growth forecasted in fiscal Q4, we expect to exit fiscal 2025 with tight DRAM inventories, significantly reduced NAND inventories and overall company DIO near our target levels. With low inventories on hand and a constructive demand environment, we will continue to focus on improving pricing and further strengthening our product mix.” — Management.  ￼

TLDR

Best Case (Bullish)

Revenue: ~$11.2B+ (above top of guidance)

EPS: $2.90+ (beats revised $2.85 guide)

Gross Margin: 45%+ (tight supply + strong DRAM/HBM pricing)

Guidance: Raised again for FY2026, pointing to sustained AI/cloud demand
	
Stock Impact: Could rally +20–30%, pushing toward $180–$200 as analysts hike targets

Worst Case (Bearish)

Revenue: < $11.0B (below guide midpoint)

EPS: < $2.70 (miss vs Street ~$2.78–$2.85)

Margins: Slip toward 42–43% (pricing softness, higher costs)

Guidance: Conservative, signaling slower demand or inventory concerns

Stock Impact: Could drop −10–25%, retracing toward $120–$130

The biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up, I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular. 

Right now PE is ~24-25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit $10-12 for FY 2026, and PE drops to 18-20 we are still looking at $200+ price target. I believe $175-185 is a lower range.

Of course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise. 

Good luck 🙏",228,169,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nm0a5q,new,DD,0.96

>EDIT:   
  
  
After Paramount CEO David Ellison's ""presumptive all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery,"" Puck's Dylan Byers has followed up to reveal that ""a well-placed Hollywood source called to suggest \[...\] that Netflix was also considering a bid for David Zaslav's \[WBD CEO and president\] assets.""

>Byers acknowledges that this scenario was once ""implausible,"" but that ""Ellison's seemingly limitless cash and ambition have accelerated Hollywood's consolidation process, and his decision to bid for all of WBD now—in an attempt to preempt potential rivals—is forcing nearly everyone to dust off their models.""

>These potential bids are coming after Warner Bros.' historic summer with a streak of successful movies at the box office. However, Puck reports that Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo ""does not expect WBD stock price to move much beyond $19 a share"" and that ""neither Apple nor Amazon will go for all of WBD.""

>Thinking along the lines that Netflix would be interested only in Warner Bros.' studio and streaming operations, Byers says: ""\[...\] as I discussed on Sunday, Zaz would need to convince his board and WBD shareholders that there would be more value coming from the split than from the Ellisons—that two in the bush is worth more than a bird in hand.""

>As far as what Paramount's possibly buying Warner Bros. means, the merging of two of Hollywood's oldest studios could result in a powerful new institution in the industry. Ellison seemingly wants to go all in on this idea, as his goal is to buy all of Warner Bros.' assets, including games, comics, and more. Netflix's offer might mean splitting up parts of the company.

TL:DR - they probably want to spin-off parts of WBD which may be a tougher sell to their shareholders than a huge bag of $ from the Ellisons for the whole thing.

Seems like Netflix is trying to take a final stab at grabbing part of WBD before they sell to PSKY. Ellisons offered $22-24/share, think some analysts were calling 21/share bullish so my take away is that the Ellisons seem likely to get this done.",299,96,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nlw4qk/netflix_to_bid_on_wbd/,new,News,0.9

1nl8km0,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 12:39:52,Duolingo DD," Dear, Ladies, gentleman and degenerate market regards

I’ve been doing a deep dive into one particular public company called Duolingo. You might be saying “wtf the language learning app?”. Yes correct, that app with the green owl. A company can be selling dog food for all I care, but if the numbers and the narrative are good, I'm buying. That being said, Duolingo ($DUOL) is slowly presenting an amazing opportunity as the stock price continues to fall. Opportunities like this is how life changing wealth is made. When everyone is betting on the downfall, you take the other side of that trade and bet against them all. The risk to reward ratio on this is too good to ignore.

Would also like to mention, if you’re an ape who has been buying into the hype of palantir with a disgusting 600 PE ratio, so high that you might as well buy your local pizza shop thats makes 100k a year for 50 million, then duolingo should not be a problem for you to take a chance on.

**The Narrative**

The bubble has officially popped on Duolingo due to rising fears of competitors entering the market. The two main competitors as of right now are OPENAI, and the tech giant GOOGLE. People are discovering through OpenAi that you can create your own language learning game and are rumoring that people will no longer need duolingo. Google had also announced that they will be entering the language learning app space with google translator utilizing ai for live language conversion. Duolingo did also damage their PR by announcing they would be utilizing AI as well, which the public did not take lightly as they misunderstood it for replacing their employees with AI. Users also had reason to believe that AI will create poor quality content in comparison to having humans manually make the courses which may be true; however, if other companies are in the race utilizing AI for language learning, then Duolingo must compete. Those 3 narratives were enough to pop the bubble of duolingo as it has fallen from $542 to $282 as of today. Can the stock fall further? Yes it can, but it's one of those scenarios where you want it to.

The P/E ratio of Duolingo was over 300 at its peak on May 15th 2025. Yes the company was way overvalued at the time for a growth company, (a fair valuation for growth companies range between (40-80) however the company is consistently beating earnings expectations and their free cash flow continues to rise higher and higher. Today that P/E ratio has dropped to 122 and its price to sales ratio has dropped to 15:1. Yes those numbers still do seem high, but 

as their free cash flow continues to rise, that P/E ratio will drop into fair valuations. Understand that this company is growing on average 40% year over year. For those who don't understand, markets are always forward looking. The institutions and retail investors who are buying into this company are betting on the fact that the over valuation numbers will drop as they consistently report good earnings, revenue and forward guidance.

**The Bull Thesis**

So before being able to predict the future, you first need to look into the past where history doesn't always repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. Take a look at the success of Netflix. Even when Amazon, Apple, Disney and Google (youtube) entered the space of video streaming, people thought Netflix would be in serious trouble. In 2011, Amazon announced that they would offer Amazon prime video for free with their subscription; while at the same time Netflix decided to increase their prices by 60%. 

Customers were furious and Netflix lost over 800 000 subscribers in 1 quarter. This resulted in their Free cash flow dropping from 59 million in quarter 2 of 2011, to 15 million in quarter 3 of 2011. Eventually their free cash flow did fall into the negatives and recovered in 2013 (you can see how the stock follows that on the charts).

**The Moat**

There is no moat. Just branding. “How is this bullish?” Well lets think, what’s Spotify's moat? What about Netflix? Literally just branding is the moat, so people who think duolingo’s demise is due to a lack of a business moat are delusional. It’s like saying in the year 2000, “why would anyone buy into amazon when anyone can make a website and sell books?” fucking regards. 

**User Experience**

When you look at music streaming services, spotify ($SPOT) was the first to the game publicly. Eventually, Apple, Google (youtube), Amazon and about 20 other music streaming platforms nobody gives a fuck about had entered the game. Yet to this day, spotify is what’s most popular among them all taking 36% of the music streaming market. Why? User experience is the answer. The spotify platform itself is what carries them and separates them from the rest for both artists and customers. 

**The Brand**

The infamous green owl logo is famous across the world. Duolingo is a world wide icon for language learning. When people hear that “ding\* sound completing a duolingo game, everyone knows instantly that it's duolingo. When people ask about learning another language, they instantly point people in the direction of duolingo. It's literally the rank #13 app on the app store for apple and on the front page of “essential apps.”

	When people talk to each other about music they ask “what's you’re spotify?” Nobody asks whats your “apple music, amazon music or youtube music”

	When your wife’s boyfriend is asking her to come over and watch a movie, he says “netflix and chill” NOT “amazon prime, disney, or apple tv and chill?” the fuck?

I'm listing these examples, because they all have a subscription business model just like duolingo. That being said, duolingo’s subscription model is actually better than theirs.

**Business Model**

Ad revenue and subscriptions, that's it. People pay a yearly subscription for their ability to learn new languages which has been proven to be more effective and enjoyable than any other method through gamification. You got kids who are using this damn app in school, recommended by their teachers and you have parents buying it for their kids. Lets not forget that this company is now going to expand out of just language learning as they have included learning subjects like music, math and chess. 

Wait? Chess? Wtf? 

Yes that's exactly what I'm thinking, but if you look beyond that, Duolingo is expanding to hit the whole education market. Why pay for chess lessons from elsewhere when you can get it on duolingo with 100+ additional learning courses. Ideally, duolingo is expanding into a whole education platform, more directed towards the youth for everything. I wouldn't be surprised if they included courses like science, finance, health etc…

	They have utilized AI in addition to help the teachers/course makers create new courses at a very accelerated pace. Their first 100 courses took them 12 years. Now with AI, they are generating 153 new courses in 1 year.

	There is NO FRICTION.

* No governments/regulations trying to stop this
* No maintenance on their assets (courses)
* No real competition in user experience

All they have to do is create a great product (a course), add it into their catalog of other courses that comes with the subscription. The more they add, the more incentive there is to go with duolingo instead of buying learning programs elsewhere.

**The Bear Thesis**

Go fuck yourself?

On a serious note, looking at Google live translation app which they offer for free; it does seem to be very reliable, but strictly for translating. They claim to be offering language learning practice tools on their google translate app which would be free. Not to mention, there are already over 1 billion downloads of google translate. Comparing it to Duolingo, yes both of them are free, however; google has not announced whether they would  put a pay wall behind learning/using their practice tool. However what google is missing in comparison to Duolingo secret formula of success would be gamification. 

If the companies continues to show slower growth, or continues to show a decline in active user for the few quarters; well then, we’re fucked. But as of right now, the decline in free cash flow from last quarter to this isn’t ""catastrophic,"" but rather a typical overreaction to the narrative. 

**External Risks**

Rising interest rates. Lets be real, trump is calling for lower interest rates but obviously Jerome Powell doesn't want to follow through with it. In the long term event that they can’t afford to lower rates but rather might  increase rates; the broad market does face the risk of a downturn just like in 2022-2023, which of course would most likely add more downward pressure to the stock and market as a whole.

Another external risk that may present itself is a massive bull market in gold, and extreme volatility in government bond markets, more specifically the 10 year yield bonds. For those who don't understand, a massive bull market in gold has always signaled warning signs that something is about to break in the financial system, because gold has always been considered the safe haven asset. Extreme volatility in bond markets signal panic when the yields spread too far apart from the benchmark rate of the federal reserve, which stands at 4.25 as of right now.

Cash from Operations

Free cash flow = cash from operations - capital expenditures.

Notice how their free cash flow keeps on rising? Notice how free cash flow has dropped in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025? That small decline in free cash flow, paired with the narrative of the company's demise in the future has resulted in a crash from $542 to $282. Let me tell you right now, if this company reports an increase in free cash flow in the next few earnings calls; Not only can the narrative change from negative to positive, this stock can very well turn around and go bullish very fast. 

**The Numbers (QUARTER OVER QUARTER) (2024/2025)**

**Shares outstanding**: 45.6 million (Plenty of room for future stock splits)

**Beta(TTM)**: 1.7 (over the past trailing twelve months, the company moves 1.7x more volatile than the Nasdaq)

**Subscription growth QoQ**: 46%

|Free cash flow|$53.7|$86.3|**61%**|
|Free cash flow margin|30.1%|34.2%|\~4 pts|

The stock price of Duolingo hovering at $270 is basically assuming the company’s growth over the next 5 years would only be at about 25%. If you take a look at the numbers above, the only thing that's under 25% are the monthly active users. The Company is projecting on its forward guidance about 35% YoY growth; which means the stock price is falling towards undervalued territory. The company has been growing at about 45% annually over the past 5 years, so yes a 35% growth on forward guidance does signal a decline in growth. But if you want to take the contrarian approach to the company, believing that AI will accelerate the growth of the company and Google means fuck all; this would be an amazing buying opportunity. 

P.S -This is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor. This is just my opinion on my projections of this company's stock price. If you buy high, panic, then sell low, too bad, sucks for you. Would recommend buying and holding the stock as we don't know how long this negative narrative will play out. (maybe **WRITING** covered calls OTM for a passive income) If you're a regard and you choose to gamble your life savings **Buying** OTM call options, good luck.

The DOE argues that current project development is moving too slowly to meet the demands of reindustrialization and the growing manufacturing base, as well as the surging load from artificial intelligence and data centers. By working with stakeholders, the department aims to identify projects that can deliver power reliably while addressing the challenges of today’s grid.*

*Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will need much more energy in the years ahead and emphasized that, under President Trump’s leadership, the DOE intends to ensure this demand can be met with affordable, reliable, and secure energy. The Speed to Power initiative is designed to harness private-sector expertise and expand the use of all viable energy sources so the United States can remain competitive in the global AI race.*

*The first step is a request for information to collect input on large-scale projects, including both generation and transmission. The program builds on Trump’s first-day executive order declaring a National Energy Emergency, which called for an urgent expansion of energy infrastructure to strengthen both national and economic security.*

*In connection with that order, the DOE released a report on grid reliability and security that sets a standard methodology to identify regions most at risk and guide interventions. The report warns that if firm, reliable sources are not added as older capacity retires, blackouts could rise one hundredfold by 2030.*

*The Speed to Power initiative is aligned with the administration’s executive orders on unleashing U.S. energy and boosting American leadership in AI, directing federal resources toward removing barriers and ensuring grid infrastructure keeps pace with demand. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are viewed as an important part of this broader effort, offering new firm nuclear capacity that can be deployed more quickly and flexibly than traditional large-scale plants, helping to reinforce reliability while meeting growing power needs.*",255,151,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-doe-launches-speed-power-110343255.html,new,News,0.95
1nl4g6m,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 10:03:11,$TTD DD: The Tendie Desk,"If you’ve seen my last couple posts I’ve been pretty good at picking stocks near the bottom before a bull run. CRDO, NBIS, ENTG, GLXY and most recently MNDY which I did a DD on. The problem is I’m a regard and mismanaged all of them for a loss except MNDY, but I’m rolling those gains into what I present before you today: $TTD. 

TTD is an ad tech company that has received a series of aggressive prison beatings in the market on its way to becoming S&P 500’s worst performing stock of 2025. They act as the Don Draper of advertising, so if you’re a company that wants to advertise on platforms outside of the walled gardens you don’t call each company individually you call TTD and they help you find the best spots for your money across the channels they have access to. Most of TTD’s slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn’t have access to youtube, prime video and ig.

[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)

They aren’t taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying “we’re undervalued” or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don’t care either way because I think they’ll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. 

The DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said “TTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market”. Well I’m putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green’s imaginings. 

[Got flamed last time for posting after my position was already up so this is hot off the press.](https://preview.redd.it/m6lu0fd3o4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d54a33d6a6fbefca78b474a478c3e828bb6b776)

Final considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix. 

Also incredibly small flyer chance TikTok’s walled garden is opened up in the US acquisition giving TTD further opportunity.",99,65,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nl4g6m/ttd_dd_the_tendie_desk/,new,DD,0.95

1nkow7c,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 20:19:37,[GAP]PING UP,"Alright, listen up you degenerates - while everyone is fomo-ing over AI, Semiconductors, Opendoor & New/Old-age tech memes - there's some real $$ to be made on some lesser focused, social arbitrage, value plays that have real potential to make 20, 30, 40%+ moves. I don't know where the rest of them are, but I'm talking about $GAP. This is a weird one but hear me out and look at my dd and let me know if I'm regarded.  
  
So why **$GAP?** I first thought about $GAP after $AEO's most recent earnings, where they shot up 40%+ after hours on results. This got me interested because the headlines for the earnings move were ""Sydney Sweeney"" related and the controversy her campaign generated, which translated into billions of impressions and many new customers. For anyone not on social media, $GAP capitalized on $AEO's controversy with their own denim ad in collaboration with KATSEYE - a global girl group which had recently been gaining insane traction with their own Netflix show, performances, and viral songs (Gnarly, Gabriela, etc.). The $GAP Denim ad went mega-viral across all social media and spawned videos everywhere of everyone replicating the dance in Denim - free advertising for $GAP. At this point, it's just an idea - so let's do some digging:  
  
**WHY DID AEO SURGE AFTER EARNINGS?**

To better understand the potential value $GAP - I wanted to better understand what made $AEO move so much after earnings. Here's what I found:

* Better than expected earnings, EPS $0.45 v $0.20 – 125% surprise beat and 15% YoY increase. They were beaten down after pulling their initial guidance, causing major uncertainty amongst investors.

* Revenue at $1.28B – beat expectations by 4.07%. Revenue was flat compared to prior year but still beat expectations and profitability surprise drove the run-up.

* Share buyback program YTD has reduced outstanding diluted shares by 10%, which contributed to increased EPS.

* Successful Marketing campaign wins in collaboration with Sydney Sweeney & Travis Kelce. According to the earnings call – 40 billion impressions, 700k new customer count, selling out of Sydney’s labeled AE products.

* Cost control which contributed to surprise EPS beat – SG&A down from last year & lower promotional activity.

* Optimistic commentary from management – they noted that they saw “nice upticks” in the AE business in Q3 – signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook – coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline). The revenues remained flat this quarter, which was surprising from how they talked about the success of their campaign, but this was explained by some of their core products being laggers (shorts). The lag was offset by the influx of new customers via the Sydney Sweeney ads.

* They noted that they saw “nice upticks” in the AE business in Q3 – signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook – coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline) 

They were also at a depressed valuation, especially after their poor Q1 Results, with P/E hovering between 9x-11x months after their Q1 earnings and before Q2 earnings. Understandable as the CEO also pulled their guidance for the year, which was a big red flag.

They are now trading at a TTM P/E of 18, and forward earnings above 14+ (I keep getting different estimate numbers, but it seems estimates are being repriced). A bit high in my opinion for a retail brand that hasn't shown stable, consistent growth - *but also not entirely unreasonable* \- and they are coming in with a more positive outlook. The markets are hungry for equities and multiples on average are higher.

They did also have relatively high short interest at \~18% before earnings, which likely also contributed to the sustained price movement upwards with shorts covering their positions. The last short interest data I looked at was on Fintel from 8/29/25 - right before their earnings. Once 9/15/25 data comes out, could validate this assumption.

Overall, the huge run-up doesn't seem to be completely ridiculous. The stock was at depressed valuations with a lot of negativity priced in. Earnings came at a huge beat, hugely successful ad campaign, and upbeat outlook from management. The price is now at an elevated multiple (maybe a little higher than it deserves, but only time will tell), but is not out of the normal for where AEO has traded historically and is not absolutely farfetched (look below:)

https://preview.redd.it/n7w09xaxk0qf1.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=359535c2340cbffd059ce947d3cf5aca44b39d02

**NOW THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY AEO MOVED THE WAY IT DID, WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT GAP?**  
  
First - I looked more into $GAP as a business. They’re much larger than AEO, generating nearly 3-4x their revenues. They also have a larger reach globally – operating in 40 + countries. They also include multiple brands under their umbrella – GAP, Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta. The big driver for GAP is their attempt to reinvigorate their brand, which has been showing slightly positive results in 3/4 brands over the past few quarters.  
  
I wouldn’t say their plan has yielded anything overly positive - UNTIL their most recent KATSEYE ad. For those of you that are unaware, it has gone insanely viral – similarly to the Sydney Sweeney ad, which is when I began looking into the stock for a potential beat / revised outlook on the brand. GAP collaborated with KATSEYE, which is a multicultural POP girl group that has been growing significantly in popularity with the younger demographic.

Their collab has already reached over 100M views on tiktok – just the main video alone (when I first checked, it was at 90M - then 2 days later, it was over 100M). People have been remaking, stitching, re-uploading the ad and those videos have also hit many millions of views (some individual video remakes have hit 40M+ views themselves, and I’m sure I probably haven’t seen all of them). IG has over 60M views ,Youtube has over 20M+ views, the shorts video has 5M+ views.

If we compare that to $AEO's Sweeny campaign, GAP has vastly outperformed in viewership (and probably engagement) across all platforms. $AEO also did pull the main ad off their social media and the supporting ads are also in the multi-millions of views, but they still don't compare to what $GAP has done in a shorter period of time.

\***Note: I did this research last week so the numbers may have shifted higher. Just checking tiktok & IG alone - the main video alone is now at 133M views on TT and \~70M views on IG.**

GAP's vids on tiktok previously were only hitting anywhere between 10-100k views. I think the more recent ones that were towards the top left gained traction as they were closer to the actual ad debut - being brought up by the launch of the ad itself. When a video goes mega viral on a page, it typically lifts the views of the other videos as well.

https://preview.redd.it/ayoqszi0l0qf1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc89f30dfe141cd7109bac05ab4ba2d82f7acb5c

There are also endless video remakes tagging $GAP & Katseye hitting insane numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/jogcin72l0qf1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2504e259f6010f5ea29b1ba1dea4d7cad3572cc6

The ad became the most searched query on tiktok and was also mentioned on GAP’s earnings in late August. The CEO stated they reached over 8 billion impressions, which I believe was probably **understated** as it was likely gathered before the actual date of the earnings for the CEO's interview on Mad Money.

***NOTE - earnings came out 9 days after the ad was released and the Q2 earnings were reporting figures from August 2nd, 2025 - before the ad was released.***

**GAP HAD AN AMAZING AD, WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GAP'S UPCOMING NUMBERS?**

If we look at total sales as of FY 2024, GAP was about 22% of their sales (3.3b/15.1b). I couldn’t find the sales mix numbers on how much Denim they sell annually, but according to ChatGPT – the expectation is that they sell between 10-20% of their revenues in Jeans. At a midpoint, we can extrapolate that GAP sells approximately $400-$500M annually in denim – which I think is reasonable assumption.

Retail typically does not perfectly sell through all of their items, and GAP is not to be excluded from this observation. They'll likely have much more denim to sell beyond what they typically do, and in preparation for a large ad campaign - retailers often adjust inventory for this.

Since it's not easy to find concrete figures online about sales mix - let's use $AEO's earnings as an example to potentially gauge the impact the Katseye ad will have on $GAP. Quote from the earnings transcript ***""Sweeny Signature jeans sold out within a week and some products within 1 day. Demand for her curated online shop of Syd's Picks has been very strong.""***

Prior to their Q2 Earnings - Zacks' consensus estimate for AEO's earnings was $1.23b (about a 5-6% decline from the prior year), while their actual revenue was $1.28b (representing a \~1% decline YoY). This was a beat on revenue expectations of \~$50M. The decline expectations seemed in line with their Q1 report, which was quite depressing. The CEO spoke of all the new customers / eyeballs they got, how they plan on retaining and converting more of these new customers, and had an upbeat outlook going into the second half of the year.

So how can we think about this with GAP? The Ads are clearly different, but I believe GAP's strategic timing and content leveraged the controversy AEO created to boost their own campaign - **and it worked amazingly**. Aside from the screenshots shown above, IG has over 60M views, YouTube has over 20M views, and 5M views on YouTube Shorts - all platforms the Katseye GAP campaign has garnered more views & engagement while being up for a shorter duration of time.

According to GAP’s earnings call, their outlook is to grow Q3 at 1.5-2.5%. At 2%, this would mean an increase in sales of \~$72 million from Q3 2024. GAP had been teetering between decline and flat revenues in the past few years but has seen slight improvements in revenue growth due to their “reinvigoration” efforts **BEFORE the KATSEYE ad** brought on an insane number of impressions to their business.  
  
Now after the Ad, it's blown any of their campaigns thus far out of the water - with reception from the Ad being overwhelmingly positive and garnered even more support as it’s been touted as “the right way” to do an Ad in comparison to AEO’s campaign. The ad itself is just much easier to talk about and spread in younger circles - what kids / young adults are going to be talking about Sydney's AE monologue over the dance and catchy song from GAP?

I believe their outlook (1.5-2.5% Q3 revenue growth) **does not meaningfully include the impact from the campaign becoming mega viral** as GAP had already been growing at similar rates in other quarters (2% increase YoY last Q3 and beat expectations by 2.5%, and similar to the past few quarters). This makes sense to me as well since the campaign launched only a week before the Earnings call.

From glancing at their website and using LLMs – their denim products seem to average near $60 (they run sales / promotions often). Assume they sell $450M annually at an average $60 price point per item - that’s about 625,000 pieces of denim they sell monthly on a regular basis.  
  
Knowing they typically have excess inventory and that this was a large campaign, let's assume a similar number of new customers come to GAP as AEO (personally, I think GAP's campaign will probably be more effective, but won't know 'til Q3). On 700,000 new customers, I think it's a conservative guess to say a million additional items will be sold (about 1.4\~items per new customer), which would translate to about $60M in additional revenue. That alone would be about an additional 1% of revenue. If we assume less conservatively, we could see an additional 1.5-3% beat on top line revenue on their Q3 estimates.

Here are a few reasons why I think they may sell more than a million additional pieces:

* A segment of shoppers that will have purchased additional items outside of the KATSEYE specific products just from browsing the page / walking through the store and seeing other things they may like.

* Shoppers that bought multiple pieces / whole outfit sets – we can see this just scrolling through something like Tiktok.

* The KATSEYE ad being on trend with younger consumers (catchy song, lyrics that are directly comparing themselves to AE and using it to their favor, easy to learn dance) and women/girls – who are the primary target demographic, and this influencing them towards a brand. Even sororities are using it for rush videos, doing the dance in Denim, gaining tens of millions of views, and tagging GAP.

* The videos seemingly performing better in a shorter time frame. In the past 2 days I’ve checked (These are not the latest numbers, I checked a few days ago, they are likely higher now): \*\***NOTE - this is from last week and checking today on 9/18 on just TT & IG quickly, the views have continued to ramp up**

   * Tiktok’s original GAP ad has already gained +10M views, reaching over 100M views now. AE’s main ad was pulled from their pages, but the remaining ads have around 2-8M views. GAP has supporting ads that have outperformed AE’s best ads.

   * Instagram’s original GAP ad gained +5M views, with over 60M views now. AE’s main ad was pulled, and the top residual ad has 12M views.

   * Youtube’s Video is at 20M views, shorts at 5M views. AE’s remaining ad has 8.8M views and 2.4M views on shorts.

* Q3-Q4 is historically stronger for GAP and retail overall

I also went on GAP and clicked into some of their Denim items and put in a Manhattan (10002) / California Zip code (90001), which gave me 40 GAP locations each, both areas were **out of stock for the products in store.** Earlier in the week, the shipping was **also out of stock**, but it seems it is once again available. I tried clicking multiple sizes, colors, and fit combinations – and they all showed up as sold out in store. A lot of them were still not available online, though it does look like they restocked a bit. I also checked other zip codes like 73301 (Texas) and 60007 (Chicago). I did not have the patience to check all the products / zip codes in the world, but I saw enough that convinced me they are likely selling through the KATSEYE collab items. The first ones I found that were in stock was a “Crop Tank Top”, which you’d have to scroll down to find – but seems like the denim items have been majorly successful.

With a potential revenue beat, and similar renewed optimistic outlook off the back of a wildly successful ad campaign that's even being studied in college marketing classes - it's a recipe for a nice turnaround retail story - the one GAP's been trying to tell for the past few quarters.

**GAP'S VALUATION & PRICE TARGET**

Like AEO before the Sweeney pump - GAP is trading under a 10 P/E and forward earnings of under \~11.5. This gives them **room to move** from both an EPS beat, and a multiple re-rating (similar to what we saw with AEO).

GAP has consistently beat EPS (past 10 or so quarters), meaning management has been diligent about costs / been much more conservative in their guidance.

Based on the current TTM earnings (2.34), a 12x P/E ratio would bring GAP stock up to \~$28. Average analysts forward estimates (\~2.07), a 12x P/E ratio would bring it to $24.84.  
  
Now this is not much upside on the stock, but as we have seen before - GAP has been consistently **beat** earnings expectations and being roughly on target with revenue expectations. **With the ad campaign, I'm expecting a revenue beat, which should help with an earnings beat** **(which I would have expected regardless of the ad campaign as stated above), meaning the $24.84 price target is unlikely and is not my target for the stock.**  
  
Then, if we consider that the stock may rerate based on a more positive outlook and that the P/E is already very low - we could very reasonably see a 13-15x P/E.

* At a 2.34 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $30.42 and 15x P/E would be $35.1

* At a 2.07 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $26.91 and 15x P/E would be $31.05

* Assume the forward earnings estimate beat by 5% (conservative beat) - that's a 2.17 EPS, a 13x P/E is **$28.21** and 15x P/E would be **$32.55**

I'm not delusional - I understand that this is a retail company that's been stagnant over the years - but stocks move when the future of a company looks better than expected. The valuation is low, expectations aren't out of the world, & a decent amount of shares short which may have to cover - which is great for a potential beat and subsequent stock price move.

**If sales and overall outlook improve off the KATSEYE campaign and they continue to beat EPS estimates like they have (boosted by an increase in sales) I would say a $28 price target is realistically achievable and good odds landing somewhere between $30-32.**

*TLDR:*

*- $GAP is trading at low valuations with low expectations and decent short interest, leaving less room for downside and more room for upside.*

*- They have an insanely successful ad campaign running currently for Q3, which has arguably outperformed $AEO's campaign. $AEO's campaign contributed to the stock moving 40% after earnings and had a similar valuation / expectation as $GAP now.*

My current position - may add more leaps:

* Lenders (Truist Bank and Omega) agreed to forbearance instead of forcing default. That usually means lenders think there’s value to preserve. Default was from technicality (PACS triggered “technical defaults” because of problems tied to its warrants and its compliance certificates to lenders, the warrant certificates provided to lenders were deemed “defective” or “incorrect"" most likely due to the audit progress), not because they are out of money or something.
* Stock is trading around $12 while analyst price targets are $30+. If filings get cleared, re-rate potential is big.
* Upside play is a recovery to $20–30 if they get current on filings. Minimum. **ATH was $43 in Q3 2024** before the Hindenburg short report which has not been proven right to this day. Was easily on track for $50/share+ by end of 2024, after IPO in April for $21 a share.
* Additionally, **the NYSE has also been repeatedly granting them extensions**, up until the final, November 19th 2025 deadline. This is **bullish** because the exchange would've frozen/kicked them out long ago if they were not showing reasonable progress on filing the delinquent filings.

We look forward to the Audit Committee completing its investigation as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities ahead to accelerate growth and drive value creation for all stakeholders.”*
* Their VERY SIMILAR competitor, who is slightly bigger, $ENSG, is trading at $160+ per share. This is incredibly undervalued, think of it as a very discounted version of $ENSG.

**What this boomer factory actually does**

PACS is a holding company investing in post-acute healthcare. Operations are decentralized: independent subsidiaries run the facilities day-to-day; corporate allocates capital, growth, and ops support. Current footprint: \~315 post-acute facilities across 17 states serving nearly 30k patients daily. The demand driver is demographics and acuity, not vibes.

Stock has been hammered and down since November 2024 where they were accused of fraud by a Hindenburg short report. Allegations have not been proven true to this day thus far. Company has been working with their independent auditors and possibly the government behind-the-scenes since then.

**NEW, latest updates in the past week with actual information:**

* Final NYSE extension granted for all delinquent filings, due November 19th 2025.
* Chief Financial Officer resigned (due to an investigation where he accepted high-value items from business partners), interim Chief Financial Officer appointed, Mark H. who is a co-founder and was previously the Chief Financial Officer from 2013 to Jan 1st. 2024.
* PACS announced in a [press release last week](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/pacs-group-announces-nyse-listing-extension-and-provides-select-preliminary-interim-operating-metrics) preliminary operating metrics
   * Portfolio size: As of June 30, 2025, PACS operates **316 health care facilities** in **17 states**, with **32,208 skilled nursing beds** and **2,419 assisted living beds**. That’s up by 96 facilities since Q2 2024, most added in second half of last year. [PACS Group, Inc.](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/pacs-group-announces-nyse-listing-extension-and-provides-select-preliminary-interim-operating-metrics)
   * CMS Rating Quality: 179 of their skilled nursing facilities (about **64.6%**) have earned a **4 or 5 Star CMS QM rating**. That’s a decent signal on quality. [PACS Group, Inc.](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/pacs-group-announces-nyse-listing-extension-and-provides-select-preliminary-interim-operating-metrics)
   * Occupancy: Total facility occupancy is **88.9%**, well above the industry average (\~78%). Breaking that out:
   * Ramping facilities are at **86.3%**
   * Mature facilities are at **95.1%** [PACS Group, Inc.](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/pacs-group-announces-nyse-listing-extension-and-provides-select-preliminary-interim-operating-metrics)
   * Skilled Mix: The percent of care that comes from skilled services (which generally pay better / drive margins) is \~**23.3%** in ramping facilities, \~**34.1%** in mature ones. [PACS Group, Inc.](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/pacs-group-announces-nyse-listing-extension-and-provides-select-preliminary-interim-operating-metrics)
   * Cash Position: PACS had **$294.2 million** in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025, up from **$157.7 million** on December 31, 2024. That gives them breathing room, assuming burn + capital needs are managed. [PACS Group, Inc.](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/pacs-group-announces-nyse-listing-extension-and-provides-select-preliminary-interim-operating-metrics)
* **Interim Chief Compliance Officer, Kathy Lauer**, recently hired gun who has a decorated career in the field of healthcare compliance, regulations, and working out deals with the government: *“I am deeply impressed by the urgency and commitment of the PACS team in its efforts to enhance compliance processes for the Company’s current phase of growth and development,” said Kathy Lauer, PACS’s Interim Chief Compliance Officer. “For many years, I have worked with highly regulated healthcare companies to improve their compliance and controls. I am confident that the PACS team is taking the right steps to best position the Company for the benefit of all stakeholders.”*

It's becoming increasingly clear that they intend to file and they have been operating their business successfully during this long independent audit journey, along with implementing new safeguards and processes so that there are no issues going forward. Market seems to like this, the stock has been climbing up daily since these recent statements, after reaching it's all-time low.

It's not too late to hop on board the spaceship. Not financial advice. I don’t know you, your account size, or your pain tolerance. Read the filings, watch the calendar, check EDGAR for official filings of delinquent earnings ahead of the November 19th deadline.

The company priced its shares to raise about $908 million, reflecting strong investor appetite for cloud security as enterprises continue shifting workloads away from traditional data centers.

Founded in 2012, Netskope built its reputation in cloud security, secure access service edge (SASE), and zero trust, markets forecasted to grow rapidly as businesses adapt to hybrid work and remote-first models. The IPO positions Netskope among top public cybersecurity players like Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks.

The public debut is seen as both a validation of Netskope’s technology and a broader signal that investor confidence in cybersecurity remains strong despite volatility in tech IPO markets. Analysts note that Netskope will now face the challenge of balancing rapid growth with public market scrutiny.

\---

I bought 1k leaps yesterday, upped to 3k after high level interactions with chat, and today rolled half my 7c's into 10c's. This one is incredibly undervalued imo. Some rough numbers

\---

\- 480,000,000 daily active users & \~932,000,000 monthly active users

\- 7% growth in MAU since last year

\- **over 5 billion Snaps are created every day** as of late 2024. IE: the average DAU sends off more than 10 snaps every day.

\- Many users have streaks exceeding 1000 days, users are sticky

\- The target audience is mostly teenagers. As per GPT: ""The platform is particularly popular with younger demographics, reaching about 90% of 13- to 24-year-olds""

\- Still super relevant, mostly seemed ignored / not on anyones radar (literally 5% of people on earth use it daily tho). I suspect this is because the primary users are the younger demographic -- ie: most people 30+ I know are not using it.

\- Valued \~$20 - 30 / daily active user.

\- With a streak of 1000+ days, if each \*DAILY\* user is worth 2c / day, it's undervalued on that alone. That's like a single ad. As per above each daily user sends on average 10 snaps a day. I'm sure they can figure out a way to make more than 2c from this. You can probably get \~2 targeted ads be per person per day, assuming 10 snaps. I think it's gotta be worth more than 2c

\- Valued at $10 two months ago and was trading over $12 earlier this year.

\- Price dumped due to bug in advertising platform last quarter. It made all the revenues look \*really\* bad, so everyone dumped / panicked without looking at larger picture.

\- Positive feedback from advertisers (ie: they enjoy the experience / working with snap): https://parameter.io/snap-stock-rises-3-following-tiktok-ban-delay-and-positive-advertiser-reviews/)

\- Reinvesting heavily into their own business & still growing

\- Trading at an all time low despite all the rest

\- Some more due diligence in my other post from yesterday:

\---

Chat - why is this regarded? Why am I regarded? IMO this is easily over $10 by EOY. Change my view. DYOR

\---

Update:

To everyone saying ""SNAP IS DEAD""... you are so incredibly wrong. Snap is growing - quite quickly. It's actually (quite literally) \~20-30m DAU's from passing insta's DAU's. Users spend \~80b hours on the app per annum, vs \~100b hours on insta. To everyone saying they have never been able to make a profit & never will be able to - people said the same thing about reddit. Then they changed how ads are in the platform and it rocketed straight up. Snap has a ton of potential IMO -- they already solved the hard problems (make an app people / especially teenagers actually want to use)

1nkats2,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 11:07:19,YOLO into $UAMY monopoly,"I have never been confident enough in a stock to publish it like this, but based on the market UAMY has cornered, it's underpriced as fuck. Here's my shot at DD:

China cut off all antimony flows — first with September ’24 export controls and then a full ban to the US on Dec 3, 2024 — which choked supply to the West and prices soared. Europe has seen shipments freeze, and buyers are scrambling for non-China supply. It's important for ammo, solar glass, batteries, and IR/defense gear, and right now there is little supply for the West. 

That’s where $UAMY comes in. The only primary/significant antimony smelter in the US. It's processed in Thompson Falls, Montana, and the US is still \~80% import-reliant for antimony. Now that China’s sale to the US is gone, the domestic smelter has a US-processing monopoly. 

The kicker: antimony often rides shotgun with gold (stibnite). Perpetua’s Stibnite Gold Project in Idaho has \~148M pounds of antimony reserves and says it could cover \~35% of US demand in its early years — and DoD just threw more money at building a fully domestic antimony trisulfide supply chain. Perpetua and UAMY are working together on metallogical testing, setting up the “gold mine byproduct to U.S. smelter” pipeline the Pentagon wants. If that matures, UAMY owns the furnace.

1nk9po1,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 10:24:28,Just hit £500k - ALL IN ON HUT 8,"**Short background on my investing journey**

Started investing June 2020 with £15k. Through pure dumb luck I’ve turned it into £500k. Started off just copy trading anything that was pumping on here. First big score was $NIO at $11, sold at $50. Then followed a popular poster in here at the time, SirJackalot into a certain banned meme stock and came out with £300k.

Thought I was a genius, made life changing money doing all the wrong things, so I proceeded to nearly throw it all away losing money on every garbage piece of shit you guys shilled me. Wish, Baba, RKT, Palantir (yeah I even managed to lose on PLTR), CLF, every weed stock, you name it, I bag held it.

Went all in AMD (Hence the name) for 2 years of sideways pain, finally sold with a tiny gain. Which leads me to my current play HUT 8. Loaded up when market cap dropped below their BTC holdings after a short report in early 2024.

**HUT 8**

**AI/HPC Pivot**

Bitcoin mining is a dying business. Due to the halving, profits are halved every 4 years. Many bitcoin miners are pivoting to hosting AI HPC data centres, which provide more reliable sources of revenue. Even miners like Cleanspark who marketed themselves as 'The last pure play bitcoin miner' are discussing pivoting. These miners have been quietly scooping up cheap power for years and I believe this is not fully priced in and there is a lot of money to be made.

HUT 8 recently announced plans to develop four new sites across the US. Including a 1000MW data centre in Texas and a 300 MW called RiverBend in Louisiana which will be upgrading to 1000MW. Stage 1 for the Riverbend site is expected to be completed by Q4 2025. Therefore I believe an announcement for a deal with a hyper scaler is imminent.

HUT has a huge power pipeline of 10,800MW with 3100 MW capacity under exclusivity and 7700 Capacity under diligence.

**Bitcoin mining carveout (Creation of American Bitcoin)**

HUT 8 has gone into partnership with the Trump brothers Eric and Don Jr to create American Bitcoin ($ABTC). HUT 8 gave away all of their miners for an 80% stake in the company. HUT 8 has pretty much given away 20% of its miners for the Trump brand. Why would they do this? Like it or not the Trump name carries premium. The most expensive stock on the market is $DJT. $DJT is sitting at a $5B market cap despite only doing $1.3m in revenue so far this year. This is by far the most overvalued company on the stock market IMO. ABTC did a private raise worth $220m bringing in the Winklevoss twins which diluted HUT 8's share from 80% to 64% which puts the value at the time of the private raise just north of $1B. They then used the cash raised to upgrade their EH/s from 10 to 24.2.

ABTC has currently been public 2 weeks and as I currently sit here $ABTC is currently trading at $7.82 which puts the market cap at $7.1B and values HUT 8's 64% share at $4.5B despite HUT 8's Market cap being $4B itself while also holding 10k Bitcoin worth $1.2B on the balance sheet.

1nk5cl8,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 07:10:18,HUGE Deal Between $INTC and $NVDA,"NVIDIA and Intel announced a multi-generation collaboration across PC and datacenter and NVIDIA will invest $5B in Intel at $23.28 per share. The joint solution will be a tight coupling Intel x86 CPUs and NVIDIA RTX GPUs over NVLink for PCs and data-center platforms. Timeframe are TBD and current roadmaps with arm will not change, per sources, meaning NVIDIA will offer both.
 
Overall
 
•PCs: Intel will build and sell x86 SoCs integrating NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets
•Data center: Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA integrates into its AI platforms
•Financial: NVIDIA is committing $5B to Intel equity at $23.28/share
•Scope: Product collaboration—not a foundry manufacturing deal
 
Why it matters
 
•Windows/x86 PCs: Higher-bandwidth, lower-latency CPU-GPU coupling should lift AI inference and pro-app and gaming performance versus discrete PCIe designs. Data center: NVIDIA gains an x86 option alongside ARM; Intel attaches CPUs into NVIDIA’s fastest-growing AI platforms.
 
What we don’t know yet
 
•Ship timing, ramp cadence, and how many generations.
•NVLink specifics (bandwidth, flavor, coherence) and CPU-DRAM/GPU-HBM memory topology.
•Process nodes and packaging (EMIB/Foveros) for the PC SoC and the custom DC CPU.
•PC SoC scope (NPU, power targets, die/chiplet counts) and NVIDIA rack-level designs.
•Software stack details (CUDA/driver model on Windows/x86; Linux support).
•Commercial mechanics of RTX chiplets inside an Intel-sold SoC and CPU attach accounting on NVIDIA platforms",1366,209,0,wallstreetbets,reddit,https://i.redd.it/y0btounwowpf1.jpeg,new,News,0.98

1njyqge,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 00:22:34,Blow-off top signals by Prominent Financial Strategists,"You can clearly see that almost all calls were premature (made when the S&P was much lower than it is today), and the anticipated crash still hasn’t arrived.

Blue line → Approximate S&P 500 path.

	•	Red shaded zones → Time windows when each strategist expected the crash to unfold.

	•	X markers + labels → When they made their big calls.



You can see how almost every shaded “crash window” (Dent 2024, Burry 2023, Hussman/Grantham early 2022–24, etc.) has already passed without the predicted collapse. Spitznagel’s window (2024–26) is still ongoing, so his call is the only one not yet “invalidated.”


Bottom line: as of 2025, none have been “right” in calling both the blow-off top and the subsequent crash. The blow-off part (late-cycle mania, AI surge) looks validated. The crash has not yet happened.

**$NUVB (Nuvation Bio)** was founded in 2018 by **David T. Hung, M.D. Oncology biotech** developing next-generation **kinase inhibitors** for genetically defined cancers. In certain cancers, aberrant kinase signaling is **constitutively active (“always on”)**, driving uncontrolled cell growth (tumors).

**Leadership** (see [here](https://nuvationbio.com/board-of-directors/))

* \~**70–80% technical/scientific** (MDs/PhDs in clinical, R&D, operations) vs. **20–30% commercial/operational** (finance, BD, legal).
* top education for all the technical people, past record of leading end to end pharmaceutical development
* James Bond villain Dr Sauvage is here.

Fun fact:

* past success: David founded Medivation, they worked on a drug called **Xtandi** and was acquired by Pfizer for \~$14B (2016).
* failure: David had a setback leading **Axovant** amid Alzheimer’s trial failures
* that failure is often not mentioned and is also part of the bear argument.

**Financial state of affairs**

statements are pretty clear in that regard:

* good cash reserve (already the case before commercialization).
* conservative estimates, taking out exceptional R&D acquisition, they can hold for 2-3 years without any dilution in the radar. they historically burns \~$40–50M per quarter so that's in line with what i am seeing on nasdaq
* confirmed by David during the few conferences in september and his CFO.

**If I say biotech you scream? “Pipeline”**

Pipeline as seen on their [website](https://nuvationbio.com/pipeline/):

https://preview.redd.it/2a0ybu4k0tpf1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeda40b14157044bed2bb0b9f551277829e04754

The dream scenario: Good Safusidenib clinical results

* promising data with a strong clinical study as released during the HC conference (see data)
* q[2 earning report](https://investors.nuvationbio.com/news/news-details/2025/Nuvation-Bio-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com): “*Discussions with the FDA regarding registration-enabling trials of safusidenib are ongoing, and the Company plans to provide additional updates in the second half of 2025.*”
* during HC, David **claim** that they are in discussion with the FDA to go for a Head-to-Head trial against **vorasidenib**
   * Clear intention of showing safusidenib superiority
   * They could capture a \~6B market if doing so moving their valuation by a whole bunch.

at this time, **i'll only care about Taletrectinib** (commercial name IBTROZI) for this analysis.

**taletrectinib** (the grim reality):

* **oral ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)**, FDA approved since June 2025.
* [In June 20](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuvation-bio-nuvb-taletrectinib-selected-104653135.html), IBTROZI (commercial name for Taletrectinib) received “Preferred Option” in updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC).
* August earnings have shown a different [story](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nuvb-sales-jump-1043-drug-launch): “…. driving $4.8 million in GAAP revenue, well above GAAP revenue estimates.”
* Not only that: “*According to the company, IBTROZI product revenue (GAAP) reached $1.2 million i****n just 13 U.S. business days after approval***\*, reflecting channel stocking and new patient start\*”
* \~$3.5M analyst’s revenu estimates.
* Long term data shows impressive improved PFS:
   * Patient who used IBTROZI saw better results especially when they haven't been exposed to other drugs.
   * Mild side-effects, pretty much whatever you see in all the medecines you probably have taken in your life.
* Competition:
   * [Nuvalent](https://investors.nuvalent.com/nuvalent-presents-pivotal-data-from-arros-1)’s rolling NDA (Sept 2025) approval **could** be **2026** (priority review) or later
   * When prompt about Nuvalent data, David debunked their studies: “*putting 100 robots, letting them loose on a football pitch and watching just 3 of them cross the 22 yard mark and then claiming 22 as their median.*”

**Some math** (can skip this section if lazy or go straight to conclusion)

Simple revenue model for Q3. I like to be very very conservative. I want to estimate **Q3 revenue** for IBTROZI under **worst-case** adoption, without using early launch spikes (channel stocking, free trials) and **ignoring churn** (only next quarter).

* Let **r = paid starts per U.S. business day over Q3** (**D business days**).
* If starts are uniformly distributed across Aug–Oct, average contribution within Q3 is 2 patient-months per start (way below the current 13 on purpose)
* PM = 2 \* S = 2 \* r\* D
* **Q3 revenue** is then: *R = PM/Price = 2 \* r D \* Price*\*

Using:

* Price ≈ $19.2k net/month (65% of the listed price)
* Three conservative adoption ceilings (the variable r): r = 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 **paid starts per business day**.

**Conclusion**:

* in the worst-case where we avoid early launch distortions and yield a conservative Q3 revenue range of **\~$1.15M–$3.83M (gross)**.
* intentionally, below \~$3.5M analyst’s estimates.
* analysts considered the worst case scenario without considering revenue outside the US.

**The bears 🐻🌈**

the classical ones that you would see in pretty much every biotech company:

* **Commercialization risk**: management have no proven track record **launching an oncology drug at scale** in the U.S. (yes they did Medivation but it seems that success was too long ago for our lovely bear).
* Competition risk from NUVL, Pfizer etc. (imo this can be debunked as long as IBTROZI is *best in class*, granted this could change at any point in time)
* Pipeline uncertainty: unfortunately a very good argument. it is insanely hard to be approved, hence why my analysis is only on IBTROZI

in my quest for value, i am always on the lookout for additional insider activity.

**The bet**

* currently above and analyst estimates are not considering the market outside of the US (they get some juicy royalties in China).
* possible commercial distribution of IBTROZI in japan makes it attractive, in fact Sauvage current stock price is also not considering forward looking statements made by David during the HC Wainwright conference,
* in fact none of the news article even mentioned what he said.

you can check it [here](https://journey.ct.events/view/ea2e92e3-d524-423c-a68a-fe84140ac942).

David mentioned a few points of interests:

* forward looking statements like “looking forward to the Q3 earnings”.
* (random, totally bs 2cts) hearing him talk during previous earning calls he has historically been very conservative in his statements.
* Nuvalent study being bogus and not statistically accurate
* Going on a head-to-head trial

volume is somehow low (possible quick jump in price)

**fair value of this stock: 5-10$ easily**

my 6th sense when it comes to gambling my hard earned money, the competence of the management as well as the conferences makes me think that they will beat some kind of expectations.

especially as far as patient adoption is concerned and revenu estimation.

David, you know, could you go on an other buying spree like you did pre-FDA approval? that would be highly appreciated.

Boolish!,"Opened last week at \~$2.89, controlling almost .2 percent of all shares outstanding in anticipation of bullish price compression that can potentially lead to a breakout as shorts cover. I'm personally not in it for overnight gains and think owning a piece of North America's largest lithium mine is actually very cool.

So far up $175k. But I'm not selling anytime soon.

What do you guys think? Lithium the next power play considering electrification?

Lithium Americas is the ONLY mine that has been approved in more than 60 years. Seems like they're the sweethearts of the administrations.

Let's see how this goes.

\---

Paperhands pick of the day. Really that simple chat - seeings a lot of this one and no bers. I do no research, I blindly follow the crowd. Buy now, DD later. Why is this a bad investment? Tell me it's horrible. Charts look like good entrance after a dip, 470m daily active users, 13b market cap, was trading over $10 literally 2 months ago. With tik tok rumors / stuff, perhaps this one has some upside too. No idea, I monkeyed in and am doing my dd later.

\---

Update: Tripled down today after posting + doing some DD with chat. As per GPT: ""A recent Snapchat advertising bug in Q2 2025 allowed some ads to be sold at significantly discounted rates, impacting the company's revenue growth and causing its stock price to fall"". Popular with the younger generation and revenue is going up (ie: growing).

Chat told me bug was fixed, it's popular with young generation & just saw a massive dip. I blindly trusted chat. 3k leaps. Max risk exposure for me.

\---

Update #2 (more DD): ""I coach a 13-18yr old basketball team at my ymca and every single kid uses Snapchat exclusively as their primary messaging app. No instagram or X. (In Texas)"". All the young people love / still use this one. More bullish than ever. This one is gonna have a meta moment.

\---

Update #3 (more DD / some handwaved numbers): Valued at like $20 / DAILY user and all users are teenagers. That's undervalued on that alone. I'm sure they can figure out a way to extract more than $20 in revenue from that market. Lots of people have streaks exceeding 1000 days. You just gotta make (quite literally) 2cents off a DAILY user a day to justify it. That's like a single ad. This one is hella underpriced

$SNAP about to have a meta moment. Paperhands 1m long on leaps.

1njcfnv,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 08:57:42,GOOG ONE-TRICK FREE MONEY BULL CASE,"Jpow might fuck us today so let me give you a generational buy opp. I've been picking up goog $GOOG on every dip, and i'm here to tell you why this shit is literally free money.

**POSITION: 75% OF MY PORT.**

# THE CORE

* **SEARCH & ADS (NOT A MONOPOLY KEK).**  This is the free-money printer.
* **THE WAR CHEST (CASH AND BUYBACKS)** They're sitting on **$100B+ IN CASH** making billions in interest. AND they're pumping their own stock with a **$70B BUYBACK** program.

# THE HYPER-GROWTH

* **GEMINI: #1 APP ON THE APPLE STORE.** Their model is already the best. Rumor is **Gemini 3.0 is going to eat even more ass**. They have the best photo editing, best video generation, and just bought windsurf. They are winning the AI race right now, and it's not even close. GPT5 worse than Gemini pro v2.5 lmaoooo.  Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
* **TPUs.** This is the hardware *literally built for LLMs* (which is half the stock market now).  They can start selling the shovels in a 20-trillion-dollar gold rush.
   * ""Google was using its own large-scale, custom AI hardware for two full years before its main competitor""
* **AI INCREASING MARGIN**  They're plugging this LLMS *directly into the ad engine* and this means higher margins on their main money-printer. They're using AI to make the printer go *faster*.
* **CLOUD** \- GCP is growing at **30%+ YOY** and is ripping market share straight from AWS and Azure. This is the growth engine.

# THE MOAT

* **YOUTUBE.** This is video, streaming, TV, *everything*. It's the most-watched platform in the world, and Shorts is knee-capping TikTok BY ORACLE
* **ANDROID + PLAY STORE :** hey own the OS for **70%+ of all phones on earth**. Every app, every in-game purchase Google gets a cut. Bless apple
* \*\*CHROME .\*\*They own the browser that literally everyone uses.  They literally PAY firefox to exist.
* **GOOGLE MAPS:** It's a monopoly. Every other app (Uber, Zillow) pays Google to use their maps. Plus, it's the front door for all local ads. They own navigation.
* **WORKSPACE (Gmail/Drive)** They own the productivity suite for half the planet, and now they're plugging Gemini right into it.
* **SEARCH-DATA:** Yes they know everything about you.  Yes they have the most data in the world

# THE MOONSHOTS

* **GOOGLE VENTURES (The In-House Degen Fund)**  Did you know Google is basically a VC fund?
   * **14% of ANTHROPIC** (Valuation $200B 🚀)
   * **8% of SPACEX** (Valuation $400B 🚀)
   * ...plus they free-rolled into **UBER** and **SLACK**.
* **WAYMO:** Self-driving cars. The private market says this bet has **4x'd since last year**. This is the future of transport.
* **DEEPMIND & ISOMORPHIC LABS:** This is the AlphaFold shit. They are using AI to discover new drugs and cure diseases. This alone is a multi-trillion-dollar lotto ticket.
* **VERILY** The life-sciences bet. This shit already raised **$3.5 BILLION**. It's only going up.
* **QUANTUM** This is the long-term bet. If this pays off, they win....and they will.

# THE ""OH YEAH, THEY OWN THAT TOO"" LIST

* **HARDWARE (Pixel, Nest, Home)**
* **INFRASTRUCTURE (Google Fiber, Voice)**
* **REAL ESTATE (The Landlord)** They own infinite prime-ass real estate. Chelsea Market in NYC? That's theirs.
* **CRYPTO:** Yes. They're building a L1.

TABLE GENERATED WITH GEMINI

    **Hypothetical Google (GOOGL) Price at Other Mag 7 P/E Ratios**
    *(Based on GOOGL TTM EPS of ~$9.48)*

1niqztt,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 15:20:43,DD - CVNA and COF are overvalued,"TLDR: CVNA (Carvana) 300Put Jan2026, Jun2026 + COF (Capital One Financial) 200 Put Jun2026

Won't go much into CVNA as its been heavily discussed before, along with the much more comprehensive deep dive into their financials since a while back by [Hindenburg Research.](https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/) But I believe that while their books are cooked, the financial pressure will be too much to hide soon.

To preface this, I understand that during economic (non-market) downturns, stocks that deal with poor financial decisions like credit cards and used cars might seem like good investment, but the current situation is different than that of 2008 or 2020. Biggest reason being, [for the first time since 1960'](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/immigrant-population-shrinking-trump-administration-rcna225881)s  US population is shrinking due to the new immigration policies.

These ""recession-proof stocks"" are at very big risk simply because they finance lower income, and often time immigrants, with little to no requirements. They do not care if you're an ""illegal"" immigrant (as long as you have an ITIN), they do not care if you have no/bad credit history, and they do not check if you have the ability to pay them back. Normally this would be fine as even if you default on the loan/debt they will claw much of it back because people usually do not file for bankruptcy and tend to make the minimum payments or work with them for a new payment plan. They can also garnish your wage or seize assets if you declare bankruptcy.

Well then you might ask, how can they fail?

**COF (Capital One Financial)**

Many of the immigrants that are being deported or are self deporting, simply max out their credit before leaving. In fact, during the six month period of January to June 2025, [US immigrant population has shrunk by 1.4 million](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/08/21/key-findings-about-us-immigrants/). Growing up as an immigrant child, this was always something that I saw first hand many times in both the Hispanic and Asian communities. When people were giving up on the American dream, they would often live to their fullest applying for and maxing out as many credit cards as possible, often sending money and gifts back to their home country before leaving.

Capital One (and their recently acquired Discover) is the industry leader in offering credit to people with bad to no credit history. Their application process is very easy and often no question asked where you just claim what your income is, and they'll approve you up to $2-3k per card. Applying for many credit card at once will often be a red flag, but usually the people who are doing this have already have been living in the U.S for a while with existing credit cards. Often they'll just apply for 3-4 more cards to max out before leaving, usually totaling to around $20-30k.

https://preview.redd.it/x5czfktaukpf1.png?width=1530&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb3bffb2eb74ed2ec58f453fe0f9f3fbede42f0e

Their exposure to credit card loans has gone up significantly, over 60%, after merging with Discover, but meanwhile their consumer deposits have only increased about 30%. They are also calculating the new credit card loans acquired at a lower default rate, when in reality the allowance for bad debt should be much higher.

Meanwhile, their stock has gone up to record highs due to the seemingly increase in customer, more cards issued, and volume in transactions. When comparing to industry average, their stock price seems reasonable and correlate strongly to one another.  But in reality, COF is significantly worse than due to their high exposure to credit loans and significantly less deposits.

For Example:  
[Wells Fargo](https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/earnings/second-quarter-2025-earnings-supplement.pdf): Credit Loans \~$50 Billions. Total Deposits \~$780 Billion

[Citi Group](https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/2025fsqtr2rslt.pdf): Credit Loans \~$110 Billion, Total Deposits \~$1.3 Trillion

[JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/quarterly-earnings/2025/2nd-quarter/ac6f00d5-6753-403a-94ca-87a0296fc28b.pdf): Credit Loans \~$390 Billion, Total Deposits \~$2.5 Trillion.

[American Express](https://s26.q4cdn.com/747928648/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-2025-Earnings-Tables.pdf): Credit Loans \~$133 Billion, Total Deposit \~$146 Billion (But their clientele is much lower default rate, and often do not use them for banking)

Even FDIC believes their loans are higher risk than stated: [link](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/capital-one-sues-fdic-overcharge-related-two-bank-failures-2025-09-11/)

and just today, they've adjusted their delinquency rate and charge offs. [link](https://ir-capitalone.gcs-web.com/static-files/e68bf5bc-6f01-4cff-8bfc-67aa1f087232)

**CVNA (Carvana)**

While Carvana has been a long discussed stock here, and with significant amount of people getting burned trying to short this stock this year, I believe the financial pressure will finally be catching up to them.

The first half of this year, Carvana benefitted significantly from Trump's tariff war as people chose to buy cheaper second hand cars as opposed to the higher tariffed costs of new cars.  However, in the second half of next year, I believe this will change as well.

First reason being the immigration issue I previously discussed. Immigrants are often the main purchasers of use cars. Carvana does not care if you are an ""illegal"" immigrant, they will sell you a car regardless. These cars are often sold to them with high interest, financed by Carvana themselves, making their business model seem highly profitable. But these cars are often used for high mileage purposes like delivery services, often depreciating the vehicles much faster than Carvana expects. With significantly lower demand, higher delinquency on payments that are backed by a vehicle significantly more worn than expected, and their ever growing inventory size, Carvana is a ready to explode.

Second reason for Carvana's downfall is lower interest rates (soon) and the deductions new vehicle gets under Trump's new tax code. Used vehicles are not eligible for interest deduction, and lower interest rates means people are more incentivized and more likely to qualify for new vehicles.

Lastly, Carvana's competition is not only CarMax. Car buying/selling has never been easier with sites like Kelly Blue Book. They link you to your local dealership, often times getting a much better value due to lower overhead costs these dealership faces. They've also announced heavy ad spending last earnings (seems desperate and goes against their cost cutting to manage profitability motto).

All in all, I believe they are facing much bigger headwinds than just cooking their books can put off.

First time really posting here, and honestly pretty new to options. Previously I gambled on INTC when new CEO fired a bunch of people and wrote down their asset value, I assume the overstated balance and obsolete assets would be written off ASAP after a new CEO so any further decline can be blamed on previous CEO, thus their balance sheet was actually understated if anything, and bought INTC 20 Jan26 calls when it was @ $19. Open to feedback and discussion, maybe I am just gambling, maybe its an investment.

1niobby,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 13:43:04,$MSTR: Setup for a Pop Tomorrow,"
I’m eyeing MicroStrategy ($MSTR) hard right now and loaded up on some calls ahead of tomorrow’s Fed decision (September 17, 2025). Stock’s at $331 after pulling back from $457 highs, but with their 639,000 BTC stash worth $70B+ at $115K per coin, this thing’s basically a turbocharged Bitcoin play trading at 1.2x its holdings. Q2 crushed with $32.60 EPS, and targets are $540-$700 easy if BTC holds steady.
Fed’s slamming through a 25 bps cut with 96% odds, and if Powell hints at more easing, BTC should run while stocks might dip on jitters. $MSTR loves that setup, lower rates make Saylor’s debt buys cheaper, and it’s got 2-3x leverage to BTC moves. Last year’s cut? $MSTR jumped 12% in a week.

Big catalysts stacking: It’s heavily shorted (15%+ of float, all-time highs in Q2), shorts are bleeding from past rallies, and whales are piling in, grabbing BTC and $MSTR options like it’s on sale. On-chain shows whale inflows spiking, MicroStrategy just added 525 BTC last week. This screams gamma squeeze potential, especially with options flow heavy on calls (2.21 ratio) and triple witching Friday. Break $350, and it could rip to $375 quick.

Plus, Saylor’s in DC today pushing the Bitcoin treasury bill with lawmakers, aiming for the US to stock up 1M BTC over five years as a strategic reserve. If that gains traction, it’s rocket fuel for $MSTR as the poster child.
Chart’s coiling at $328-$334 support, RSI oversold, volume building. Risks if Powell’s hawkish, but jobs data’s weak, so I like the odds. Not advice, just why I’m bullish tomorrow.

\----

I don't understand the risks involved on LDI - so I can't price risk well but still wanted exposure. Chat didn't convince me price action on my options were safe from rate cuts, but I wasn't convinced they were going to drop either. So risks were high. Unlikely I follow LDI any longer past this unless it dips a lot -- I try to identify underpriced risk, which when these options were bought last week was good value. Time to find the next play. $LDI did 100b in loans a few years ago and likely to fly longer term on rate cuts / cycle. I'm unsure how long that takes / where this goes (but wanted investments still) - so deleveraged. I liked what I found, but risks are high. I \*trade\* options and invest in shares. DYOR.

I've made it very clear to chat several times that I use options to leverage my bets & take gains very quickly. I take gains out all the time. These were higher yesterday - todays timing and rate cuts coming make the risk on these higher. Longer term likely a good bet - so still invested quite heavily (50k shares). My strategy is really is this simple: buy the dip, sell the run. These were bought on the dip last week, and if it dips again I may look for another options play on them again.

My risk on these is now 0, so I don't have to follow in depth anymore. I only follow a few tickers at once. I papered out at the bottom this morning, it's up \~4% since I did this.

\[THE NEWS BELOW WAS FALSE / SPREAD BY BEARS FOR A BEAR RAID. SEE UPDATE 2\]

Update: Bought puts at EOD to hedge share risk (not posted). CEO sold all his shares today, saw this at \~4pm today (IE: AH, markets closed). That's all the bearish confirmation I need.  I'm fully out tomorrow / potentially short / puts. Goodluck chat

Well $PSKY has had an active week. A little faster than I had originally expected, but hopefully many of you were able to trail my initial position posted last week to make some money.

* [PART 1: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nedg0a/the_larry_play_paramount_skydance_psky/)

**I figure with all the recent excitement this is grounds for a Part 2:**

1. **$WBD Deal**
   * PSKY is planning a majority-cash, Ellison-backed bid for ALL of Warner Bros Discovery. For those paying attention, WBD planned to spinoff its assets into two separate cos in 2026: one was to be studios and streaming, the other was going to be networks. There was undoubtedly going to be a bidding war for the streaming assets. By getting out ahead of the spinoff and buying the assets before the others could, Larry is boxing out the competition. We have no clue how this is going to be structured. We only know that it’s Larry-backed. That said, we can obviously expect a sweetheart deal for PSKY that totally de-risks any funding concerns.
2. **Oracle/TikTok**
   * CBS reported that Oracle is leading a consortium for TikTok’s US assets. If you think Larry’s not going to use this distribution channel to pump PSKY’s content library, you’ve got your head in the sand. There are 170 million TikTok US users (NFLX has 90 million paid US Subscribers) and 40% of Zoomers’ screentime is spent on TikTok. The conversion metrics could be huge here.
3. **Value Dispersion**
   * NFLX has a market cap of $500B. It lost like $25B in value after the PSKY/WBD deal was announced.
   *  PSKY’s market cap is $20B. It gained only \~$4B in value since the announcement.
   * Even shitty HULU is valued at nearly $30B on Disney’s balance sheet.

**I’m no mathematician, but there seems to be a mismatch here. You can buy what may become the primary NFLX competitor for a fraction of the price.**



**TLDR:** $PSKY.... HIGHER. 

  
**Position**: December/Jan Calls (Supporting Image attached)

1nhzrer,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 18:09:49,Nobody watching APLD,"Nobody on here is really talking about Applied Digital (APLD) and I think it has serious potential. The stock is sitting around 19.50 right now and it has already run over 70 percent in the last three months. What makes it interesting is not just the chart but the actual business story.

APLD is building out high performance data centers specifically designed for AI workloads. They already signed hosting contracts worth over 11 billion dollars, mostly with CoreWeave, which is one of the fastest growing names in the AI compute space. These are not small speculative deals either. They are long term leases that give APLD revenue visibility for years.

The company has about 200 megawatts of capacity now and plans to reach 400 to 500 megawatts by 2026. Each 100 megawatts can generate around 300 to 400 million in annual revenue. Analysts are projecting revenue to grow from about 450 million in fiscal 2024 to over 1.2 billion by fiscal 2026. That type of growth would support a market cap in the 3 to 4 billion range compared to about 2 billion today.

If AI demand stays hot and they continue hitting build out milestones, I think a reasonable short term price target is 25 to 27 by the end of this year. If momentum really catches on and retail wakes up to this play, I could see it testing 30. The risk is execution and concentration with a few clients, but the math lines up.

There is a play for those who are too afraid to take a position. I'm usually not a fan, but considering how fake the actual economy is versus the numbers it is about the safest play and history dictates that rate cuts drive the price up of the underlying asset.

Gold, go buy GLD shares or calls. 

These days even Bitcoin seems to sway with the market, gold is the only one that is mostly independent.

I picked up my calls last week, and doing pretty good so far. It is admittedly a small bet so normally it wouldn't be worth posting, but given the uncertainty this week may be helpful for some.

Paperhands buys first, does his DD later via shitposting in the daily. Here's some very high level due diligence. This company did \~30b in loans last year. It did \~100b in loans in 2020. It's a legitimate company and a large refinancer. The reason for the drop wasn't a failing business, it was due to rising interest rates. They refinance homes / mortgages. In rising rates - nobody does that so business looks bad. Interest rates are cyclic -- they will eventually come back down. When they do (not just 1 cut, but looking several ahead) these guys business booms as everyone wants cheaper mortgages. This can be doubly advantageous - lower rates (people remortgage) + potentially higher margins on the loans (depends how competitive they price things / where interest rates go). I chatted with a few people who have used them and they said they enjoyed the experience / using loandepots products. They advertise themselves as low friction, very quick with competitive rates. They operate in 20 countries, have \~5000 employees & a \~2b market cap. It was trading above $30 in the low interest rate environment circa 2021.

Lots of people worried about insider selling. It's a no story. CEO's compensation is primarily in shares and they jumped massively. I don't blame him for taking profits or derisking. We don't know why he sold. People said the same thing about OPEN (I was a bear also -- because insiders sold sub $1 and they tend to know stuff) -- and look where it went. Insider ownership is \~85% on LDI.

With not much additional DD, I bought more this morning. I haven't look at the finance sheet, etc - as it tends not to matter for my investment style. This is my largest position & max risk tolerances for me. I'll let chat know if positions change.
