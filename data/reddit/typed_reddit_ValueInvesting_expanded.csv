1jw7m3i,2025-04-10,2025-04-10 16:15:48,Warren Buffett On If Japan Divested from US Bonds (1998),"Someone once asked Warren Buffett about the threat of Japan selling their US bonds. Somewhat relevant here:

WARREN BUFFETT: I was busy chewing here and —

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Japan is a major holder of U.S. Treasurys. Given the troubled Japanese economy, do you foresee Japan cashing in their U.S. investments to bail themselves out? Why or why not?

WARREN BUFFETT: The problems with the Japanese economy and does that mean that — are you thinking particularly about them dumping Treasurys or something of the sort?

CHARLIE MUNGER: That’s exactly what she’s —

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. (Laughter)

Well, you know, it’s very interesting. All the questions about what so-called foreigners do with investments.

Let’s just assume the Japanese, or any other country, decides to sell some U.S. government holdings that they have. If they sell them to U.S. corporations or citizens or anything, what do they receive in exchange? They receive U.S. dollars. What do they do with the U.S. dollars? You know, I mean they can’t get out of the system.

If they sell them to the French, you know, the French give them something in return. Now the French own the government securities.

But really as long as we, the United States, run a deficit — a big deficit — a trade deficit — we are accepting goods and giving something in exchange to foreigners. I mean when they send us whatever it may be — and on balance they send us more of that then we send over there — we give them something in exchange.

We give them — we may give them an IOU. We may give them a government bond. But we may give them an investment they make in the United States.

But they have to be net investors in this country as long as we’re net consumers of their goods. It’s a tautology.

So I don’t even know quite how a foreign government dumps its government bonds without getting some other type of asset in exchange that may have an effect on a different market.

The one question you always want to ask in economics is — and not a bad idea elsewhere, too — but is, “And then what?” Because there’s always a second side to a transaction.

And just ask yourself, if you are a Japanese bank and you sell a billion dollars’ worth of government bonds — U.S. government bonds — what do you receive in exchange, and what do you do with it? And if you follow that through, I don’t think you’ll be worried about foreign governments selling U.S. bonds. It is not a threat.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: If I owned Japan, I would want a large holding of U.S. Treasurys. You’re on an island nation without much in the way of natural resources. I think their policy is quite intelligent for Japan, and I’d be very surprised if they dumped all their Treasurys.

WARREN BUFFETT: If they’re a net exporter to us, though, what choice do they have? When you think about it.

If they send over more goods to us than we send to them — which has been the case — they have to get something in exchange. Now for a while they were taking movie studios in exchange, you know — (Laughter)

They were taking New York real estate in exchange.

I mean they’ve got a choice of assets, but they don’t have a choice as to whether — if they send us more than they get from us — whether they get some investment asset in return.

I mean it’s amazing to me how little discussion there is about the fact that there’s two sides to an equation. But it makes for better headlines, I guess, when read the other way.

1k6qy5m,2025-04-24,2025-04-24 08:28:18,Sex Workers Already Predicted There's A Recession Coming — Here's How They Know,"

While some people anxiously watch the stock market for signs of a recession, others look for more subtle cues that the economy is in trouble.

One of them is Catherine De Noire, a manager of a legal brothel, a Ph.D. candidate in organizational psychology and an influencer. When business at her brothel unexpectedly dips, De Noire takes it as a sign that the economy is in trouble.

Although De Noire is based in Europe, she believes that economic upheaval in the United States “triggers huge uncertainty” across the pond because of America’s global influence. De Noire first noticed a decline in business right after Donald Trump was elected in November 2024, as Americans and the rest of the world anticipated upheaval.

Strippers in the U.S. are also feeling the pinch. Dancer and influencer Vulgar Vanity said that when she first started dancing in 2022, she could earn six figures just by dancing during a handful of big events in Austin, such as the Formula 1 Grand Prix and South by Southwest music festival. This year is different.

“I didn’t even bother working South by Southwest because the first Friday night I attempted to work, I walked into a completely empty club and didn’t make any money at all,” she said.

Vanity also says that many of her regular customers aren’t tipping at all or tipping less than half of what they used to. She is quick to point out that she is just one dancer and “obviously not an economist,” but she notes that other dancers and tipped workers are also hurting. Her theory is that her customers are no longer tipping as generously because of rising costs and economic uncertainty. Vanity is worried that this means we are on the verge of a recession or full-blown depression.

The theory behind the ""lipstick index"" is that when money is tight, consumers substitute costly purchases with cheap luxuries like lipstick.


Are these astute women onto something? Indicators like a decline in business at brothels, lower tips for strippers and other nontraditional measures of economic health “have a measure of validity but may be more coincident indicators than leading ones,” said Marta Norton, a chief investment strategist at Empower. While Norton finds this type of anecdotal evidence interesting, she says she looks at more traditional sources of data, especially corporate earnings and the stock market, to predict if a recession is in our future. 

By those traditional measures, “We may be slowing, but we aren’t facing a looming recession. Yet,” she said. De Noire believes that the tariffs Trump announced on what he called “Liberation Day” will “definitely contribute to a further decline and recession.”

Nevertheless, the past has shown that nontraditional measures can tell us a lot about the economy’s health. Here are some of the anecdotal indicators of the economy about whether a recession is likely.

The Brothel Index

According to De Noire, business at her brothel usually picks up in the spring once people give up on their New Year’s resolutions and recover from holiday spending. But this year, business is down. She attributes the “huge dip” in earnings at her brothel to customers feeling insecure about the economy.

“There are significantly fewer clients coming in, and the sex workers are reporting noticeably lower earnings,” she said. Although De Noire emphasizes that the top sex workers at her brothel are still earning more compared to the general population, she said some of the highest earners at her brothel are earning about half of what they did during the same time last year.

“We’re seeing clients come in less often, try to negotiate lower prices or stop visiting altogether. We’re also hearing from our workers that more clients are going for the cheapest possible service,” she said.

According to De Noire, this suggests that people are saving money or reallocating their spending toward things they see as more essential, likely because they’re preparing for challenging times ahead.

Legal brothels in the U.S. are seeing a similar trend, according to Andrew Lokenauth, a data analyst and founder of BeFluentInFinance.com. He explains that revenue at legal brothels in Nevada is down roughly 20% since last quarter. “My research shows this correlates strongly with discretionary spending trends,” indicating a recession is likely.

The Stripper Index

Strippers are often the first ones to notice a downturn in the economy. Dancers are “obviously not a priority or household necessity” and “are the first to feel it because we’re the first ones tossed aside,” Vanity said.

“The ‘stripper index’ is one of those odd but oddly effective indicators” of economic health, said David Kindness, a certified public accountant and finance expert. It tracks how much strippers are earning and how often customers are going to strip clubs, he explained.

“When tips slow down and foot traffic thins out, it often means people are holding onto their extra cash,” Kindness explained. According to Lokenauth, Vanity isn’t the only dancer feeling the squeeze, and that’s not a good sign. “Strip club revenue in Vegas is down about 12%,” which could indicate we are headed for a recession, Lokenauth said.

The Beer Index

What type of beer people drink is a “pretty good indicator” of whether a recession is on the horizon, said Jack Buffington, an assistant professor of supply chain management at the Daniels College of Business at the University of Denver.

“Beer is a discretionary spend and a social spend,” so people cut back on how much they spend on beer when they are worried about the economy, he explained. Since it’s much less expensive to pick up a six-pack than to go out for draft beers, how much money people are spending on draft beer, and pricey craft beers in particular, is a harbinger of a recession.

“Craft beer sales are way down,” potentially indicating a recession is likely, Buffington said.

The Men’s Underwear Index

In 2008, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan observed that declining sales of men’s underwear likely meant we were headed for a recession. “There’s a concerning trend. Sales dropped roughly 6% over these past months,” Lokenauth says. “Guys only skip replacing underwear when they’re worried about money,” so we may be in trouble, he says.

The Lipstick Index

The “lipstick index” “illustrates a seemingly contradictory consumer pattern during economic recessions,” explains Kevin Shahnazari, a data analyst and co-founder of FinlyWealth.

The Lipstick Index doesn’t just apply to lipstick. The theory behind the Lipstick Index is that when money is tight, consumers substitute costly purchases with cheap luxuries like lipstick.

“In the 2008 recession, cosmetics sales increased, showing that even in tough times, individuals crave tiny comfort purchases that give psychological boosts without a hefty financial outlay,” Shahnazari explained.

For example, someone might skip a costly facial but buy a $10 lipstick. Or they might skip an expensive dinner out but still buy a $6 latte or a box of expensive chocolates.

Today, cosmetics sales are strong. “MAC and Sephora sales are up about 15%, not a great sign for the broader economy,” Lokenauth said. Moreover, there “is a quiet trend towards lower-cost, no-frills beauty,” and cosmetic sales in drugstores have risen over the past few months, Shahnazari said. This could be a sign we are headed for a recession.

The Online Dating Index

How people date can also indicate whether or not we are headed for a recession. Paid subscriptions for online dating services have fallen, even though the total number of users has risen, Shahnazari said. “Free and lower-tier use of dating apps has risen by about 12%, indicating social and financial stress,” he explained.

Additionally, increased use of online dating apps can be a sign that people are looking for “cheaper entertainment and companionship instead of expensive nights out,” Lokenauth said. “I’ve tracked this metric for years, and it’s scarily accurate,” he added.

The Hemline Index

Hemlines “rise with optimism, fall with doubt,” Shahnazari said. “Although absurd, this psychological anomaly quantifies consumer confidence and social mood,” he explained. Historically, shorter hemlines meant economic optimism, and longer hemlines signaled economic trouble. For example, the happy-go-lucky flappers in the Roaring Twenties wore short dresses, but hemlines got longer during the Great Depression in the 1930s.

Currently, the Hemline Index is sending mixed signals because recent designer collections are featuring both long and short hems, Lokenauth said. Thanks to fast fashion, hemlines aren’t as clear an indicator as they once were, he explains. However, given the accuracy of the Hemline Index in the past, he thinks it’s worth keeping an eye on the runways next season.

**The Brunette Index**

If you notice fewer blond hairdos, it could be a sign a recession is looming. “Stylists are often the first to notice economic shifts, and lately, many have mentioned clients asking for easier and cheaper options,” Kindness said.

Clients may shift from high-maintenance hairstyles to lower-maintenance natural looks as a way to save money, Kindness explained. There are signs spending at salons is down. If you see formerly blond “recession brunettes” out and about, it might be a sign a recession is coming, he said.",3033,209,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-recession-is-coming-sex-workers_n_67eaa67fe4b008c5a2ecc0bc,all,Basics / Getting Started,0.96
1jaeywd,2025-03-13,2025-03-13 11:43:04,Remembering the stock market crash of 2022,"It’s easy to forget how short the market’s memory is. I think this community understands it better than anyone else, but it's still worth re-visiting from time to time.

I still remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.

Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.

Meta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren’t making money. Zuckerberg was ""burning billions"" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.

It wasn’t just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google’s ad revenue shrank. Microsoft’s growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.

And then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.

Meta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.

When markets are crashing, it feels like they’ll never go up again. When they’re at all-time highs, it feels like they’ll never go down. Neither is true. So just be calm and hold tight. And if you can, keep buying.

1ki81ib,2025-05-08,2025-05-08 22:36:48,Buffett’s Farm Analogy Is Still the Clearest Way to Think About Valuation,"Buffett once explained business valuation using something as simple as a farm — and honestly, it cuts through all the noise.

Imagine you’re looking at a farm 30 miles out. You figure out how many bushels of corn and soybeans it produces per acre, what fertilizer and labor cost, and what you’re left with .. say, $70 per acre in profit.

Then you ask a simple question:  
*How much would I pay to earn $70 a year forever?*

If you want a 7% return, you’d pay $1,000. If the farm is going for $900, it’s a buy. If it’s $1,200, you pass.

That’s it. No drama, no daily price tracking, no CNBC.

Buffett says investing is just that ,,,,figuring out how much cash a business can produce over time, and what you’re paying for it. That’s intrinsic value.

And you don’t need to have an opinion on every stock. Most go into what he calls the “too hard” pile. The goal isn’t to be right about everything  it’s to wait for the few things that are easy to understand and priced right.

You don’t need to jump seven-foot bars. Just step over the one-foot ones.

1k2dlk8,2025-04-18,2025-04-18 15:37:17,Buffett's alternative to tariffs is seriously brilliant (Import Certificates),"I'm honestly not sure how this hasn't been brought up more, but Buffett actually has a beautifully elegant alternative to tariffs that solves for the trade deficit (which is a very real problem, he said in 2006.... ""The U.S. trade deficit is a bigger threat to the domestic economy than either the federal budget deficit or consumer debt and could lead to political turmoil..."")

Here's how Import Certificates work...

* Every time a U.S. company exports goods, it receives ""Import Certificates"" equal to the dollar amount exported.
* Foreign companies wanting to import into the U.S. must purchase these certificates from U.S. exporters.
* These certificates trade freely in an open market, benefiting U.S. exporters with an extra revenue stream, and gently nudging up the price of imports.

The brilliance is that trade automatically balances itself out—exports must match imports. No government bureaucracy, no targeted trade wars, no crony capitalism, and no heavy-handed tariffs.

Buffett was upfront: Import Certificates aren't perfect. Imported goods would become slightly pricier for American consumers, at least initially. But tariffs have that same drawback, with even more negative consequences like trade wars and global instability.

The clear advantages:

* **Automatic balance:** Exports and imports stay equal, reducing America's dangerous trade deficit.
* **More competitive exports:** U.S. businesses get a direct benefit, making them stronger in global markets.
* **Job creation:** Higher exports mean more domestic production and, consequently, more American jobs.
* **Market-driven:** No new bureaucracy or complex regulation—just supply and demand at work.

I honestly don't know how this isn't being talked about more! Hell, we could rename them Trump Certificates if we need to, but I think this policy needs to get up to policymakers ASAP haha.

Edit: removed ‘no new Bureaucracy’ as an explanation for market driven. It def does increase gov overhead, thanks for pointing that out!

Pullbacks are always something we say we want, particularly as value investors, but they usually come when things are scary. Financial crisis, global pandemics, policy shocks… the discount never shows up gift-wrapped.

Yesterday’s tariff news felt like one of those moments. It’s vague, feels arbitrary, and creates a lot of uncertainty. It feels scary. And yet, that’s exactly the environment where opportunities show up.

I’ll admit it, days like today make me uneasy. But as an investor, I remind myself that underneath the noise, what’s really happening stocks are getting cheaper.

And that’s what we’ve been waiting for.

Buffett was asked if he's worried about “NASDAQ stocks trading at 30x revenues instead of 10x earnings.” His answer?

“We don’t care. There’s always a part of the market that’s nuts.”

They tried shorting hype stocks once when they were younger. Were right. Still lost money.

Also, they don’t chase international stocks *just* because they’re cheap. But if a $5B+ business outside the U.S. meets their standards? Game on. Geography isn’t the filter — durability is.

My favorite part though?

“We don’t have to predict the future. We buy businesses where chewing gum is still chewing gum in 20 years.”

Now  I know some folks will ask for tickers. I get it.  
But the real flex isn’t copying someone’s stock list , it’s knowing **what return** ***you*** **need** and then working backwards to figure out if the valuation gives it to you.

If that resonates, you might want to scroll back on my profile where I broke it down using Buffett’s **farm analogy**. (Hint: the price you pay only makes sense when you know what kind of yield you’re happy waking up to every year.)

Honestly thought it was his least interesting move. Boy was I wrong.

Had this lightbulb moment reading about their float growth - $39M in 1970 to $169B today. That's not just growth, that's basically getting handed a massive investment fund where your ""lenders"" (policyholders) pay YOU upfront and don't charge interest. Meanwhile, I'm over here scraping together cash to buy individual stocks or considering margin loans that cost me 8%+ annually.

The more I think about it, the more brilliant it seems. While most of us value investors are sitting on sidelines waiting for crashes with our limited cash, Buffett's got this perpetual money machine funding his patient approach. He literally gets paid to wait for Mr. Market's mood swings.

Makes me wonder if I've been looking at insurance stocks all wrong. I used to avoid them thinking they're too complex and regulatory-heavy, but maybe that's exactly why they can be such great value plays when nobody wants to understand them.

 “Buy the dip!”  “Be greedy when others are fearful!” Lmao 

Did you really think you’d be the one who wasn’t fearful? Especially when all the smart people around you are being fearful?

“Buy great companies at good prices.”  Lmao.  Did you think you’d find a company with perfect fundamentals that just HAPPENED to be priced poorly?  

I think people misunderstand the cliches.  
In order to get a good price on something, it REQUIRES either poor macroeconomic circumstances or poor management.  In order to get a GREAT price, it requires both at the same time.

GEICO was arguably Buffet’s best investment from 1965 to 2025.


In 1975-76, when Buffet bought it, it was near bankruptcy, hemorrhaging losses, and trading under $3/share.   From 1976 to 1986, GEICO delivered 50% CAGR.


All investors could see was wreckage. Geico was expanding coverage into risky areas at ridiculously low premiums.  Inflation hit and boom… their claim costs suuurrrrrged.


They took on huge underwriting losses.  Claims ballooned, especially from urban drivers and their young policyholders.

They were so focused on growth that they forgot about making sure they had adequate reserves.   

This js why Buffet is absolutely GOATED.  On paper, EVERYTHING about Geico looked horrible.  At least to my accounting eyes.  Hindsight makes some of the turnaround signs seem obvious, but they really weren’t quantifiable via something like a dcf. 


- claim rates are surging
- claim costs are surging
- claim fraud is surging
- inadequate cash reserves
- governments block insurance price increases right when Geico wanted to increase premiums
- too many employees and regional offices.
- management just accelerated the losses to force revenue growth

- double digit inflation…
- interest rate hikes to over 13%
- recession
- oil crisis
- stock market crashes 50%

- then all of a sudden this all adds up to a $126million loss and bankruptcy was on the table…


…. Enter Warren Buffett. Absolutel animal.  Looks at all this and decides “This is a wonderful company.”

Everyone was fearful for very good reasons.  If Reddit were around back then, every single valueinvestor user would be shit talking Geico.

Buffet just decided, meh… the business model is good, liquidity is high enough to avoid bankruptcy for a few more years, and Geico is a good brand.  What more do you need for a thesis? 


+20 bagger for Buffet.


Whenever you see **truly discounted prices**, the backdrop always looks fucking brutal.

- Earnings are collapsing.
- Management seems clueless.
- The economy feels like it’s in freefall.
- Financial news is a parade of panic.

Blah blah blah. 

But are these not the exact conditions that allow us to buy quality assets at deep discounts?

Prices always reflect a reasonably justified fear.
Good prices come from bad news. But the bad news doesn’t last forever.

$61 to $2 is what happened to Geico’s stock.  It fell for 4-5 years straight.   

…Imagine negative trends in earnings, debt growth , asset contraction, cash burn, and margin contraction all holding for that long, but you manage to look at it and see it as a winner.

Copied from here: https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kheec2/the_ultimate_fundamentals_guide_on_what_you_need/

This is going to be the ultimate guide on ***what*** you should learn first starting from knowing absolutely nothing about investing to becoming an investor who can beat the market indexes. It doesn't matter if you invest in penny stocks or blue chips. The principles are all the same.

This is an opinionated guide. If you just want a resource unopinionated guide then check out this github:

[https://github.com/2007selvam/stock-market-toolkit](https://github.com/2007selvam/stock-market-toolkit)


# Prerequisites

\- There are no capital requirements to investing. In fact you should start learning as soon as possible because it takes time to become proficient at investing.

\- This guide is only for fundamentals as I specialize in fundamentals and not day trading, technical charting, cryptocurrencies or forex trading.

\- This guide is tailored towards people who want to individually pick stocks, if you solely do ETF's or index investing this guide is still useful to you but not aimed at you.

\- Investing should be done with disposable income. NOT with income you need such as rent money.

\- If you aren't willing to put in the time and effort that investing requires to beat the market indexes then you should stick to passive investing and just buy an index fund and forget about it for 20 years. This requires 0 effort but you will never beat 8% a year on average and you because you lack experience you may panic and sell at times when you shouldn't.

# 1. Getting Started

To start off I would recommend watching this overview video, it quickly goes over the main stuff by legend investor Bill Ackman:

[Bill Ackman: Everything You Need to Know About Stocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEDIj9JBTC8)

Then you should start reading, lots of reading and no big amounts of investing. You have to read books from other fundamental investors to have an idea of how they did it and the decades of accumulated experience of investing they have poured into that book. It's important to read the right books from authors who have a track record of beating the market, not just anybody. I have ordered this list in terms of ease of reading for newbie investors as well as priority:

1. [Peter Lynch - One Up On Wall Street](https://www.amazon.co.uk/One-Up-Wall-Street-Fireside/dp/0743200403)
2. [Peter Lynch - Beating the Street](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beating-Street-Peter-Lynch/dp/0671891634)
3. [Joel Greenblatt - The Little Book That Beats the Market](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Beats-Market-Books-Profits-ebook/dp/B000YIUWFQ)

These 3 are all easy books for a beginner to get their feet wet and start off with some solid fundamentals. The harder books will come later.

# 2. Reading Financial Statements

Investing is all about reading financial statements and understanding how to read them such as the 10-k, 10-Q etc. Pick any company, it doesn't matter which one but I recommend that you pick a simple company that you already use and know.

**Income Statement**

* [Session 2: The Income Statement (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8wKr1QDSwg)

**Statement of Cash Flows**

* [Session 4: The Statement of Cash Flows (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XobT12fvkXc&t=1s)

**The Balance Sheet**

* [The Balance Sheet (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSuc2HHQpxc&t=1s)

&#x200B;

**Official RNS Reporting Sites**

Companies are required to file official reports with their countries regulator, in the U.S this is the SEC (apart from small companies that trade Over The Counter).A list of the most popular official sites, you can search for your company on here:

\- [SEC - United States Listed Stocks](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

\- [OTC - United States OTC (Penny) stocks](https://www.otcmarkets.com/)

\- [LSE - UK Stocks](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/)

\- [ASX - Australian Stocks](https://www2.asx.com.au/)

\- [NZX - New Zealand Stocks](https://www.nzx.com/)

\- [TSX - Canadian Stocks](https://www.tsx.com/)

\- [CSE - Canadian Alternative Stocks](https://www.thecse.com/)

\- [EURONEXT - France, Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Norway, Alt UK](https://www.euronext.com/en)

\- [GPW - Polish Stocks](https://www.gpw.pl/en-home)

\- [BOERSE FRANKFURT - German Stocks](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en)

Filings dump: [https://github.com/2007selvam/stock-market-toolkit#filings](https://github.com/2007selvam/stock-market-toolkit#filings)

It makes no sense to limit yourself to investing in one country only. A lot of bargains lay in other countries and you should expand your horizons to them and not just U.S stocks on Robinhood. So I added international links above too.

A lot of the above sites also have email signups so you can be notified **instantly** when a companies publish a new report.

# 3. Intrinsic Valuations

The most important part of this section in my opinion. If you understand how to intrinsically value a company then you understand when to buy and when to sell a company based on it's real value.

These differ from relative valuations such as the ratio's (PEG, PE etc) because here we are trying to find the intrinsic value to a company and NOT the relative value compared to it's peers. This is an important difference, for example in the 2001 dot com bubble you could have valued an insanely overvalued internet stock with a relative ratio such as Price-Operating-Cash-Flow and you may have found it to be better than it's peers. Just because it's better relatively than it's peers in it's industry does not mean a company is fair value.

**Discounted Cash Flows Models**

The reason a lot of people do not like DCF's is because:

1. They do not understand how to do them properly.
2. The resources online are absolutely terrible for DCF's, most use CAPM (in my opinion, a completely flawed way to calculate your WACC).
3. The templates are confusing.

I felt the same way until I watched Aswath Damoradan's course on corporate finance.

Here's the short course with 15 min long videos each:

[Short Course on Valuation (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znmQ7oMiQrM&list=PLUkh9m2BorqnKWu0g5ZUps_CbQ-JGtbI9)

However I highly recommend you do the entire university course (for free) because it's invaluable to understanding how to intrinsically value companies:

[2019 Full MBA Valuation Course (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMw4AuMRlE&list=PLUkh9m2Borqkr0lxe9WjH7cDBi4ZnZPOx)

There is a lot of cross-over between the above two playlists so once you do one course you can cherry pick videos from the other course.

Here are some resources on how to do your own DCF's:

[Covid DCF Template Excel Spreadsheet (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9GfXJ-IrSA&list=PLUkh9m2Borqnk6tJUpGzN4RcDUBAjovqN&index=4)

[NYU - All Valuation Spreadsheets (Free)](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/)

The reason why I like these DCF models are because they are easy to use (Aswath explains how to use the excel template it in his video) and it does not use the flawed CAPM model for calculating the WACC.

**Dividend Discount Models**

An alternative way of getting the intrinsic value of a company. I do these very rarely so I'm no expert on them. I hope to up date this section in the future with more details.

# 4. Relative Valuation Ratio's & Technical Terms

There are **a ton** of financial terms and ratio's to learn such as PE, PEG, ROIC etc. The way to go about this is to learn these ratio's as you go when you encounter them in a book or your valuation and not just all at once. Investopedia usually has good explanations and videos of every term.

\- [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/)

The most important ratio's and relative valuations in my opinion are:

\- [Revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp)

\- [Operating Margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingmargin.asp)

\- [Operating Income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp)

\- [ROIC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestmentcapital.asp)

\- [WACC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) (not the CAPM Version)

\- [Price-to-operating Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-cash-flowratio.asp#:~:text=The%20price%2Dto%2Dcash%20flow%20(P%2FCF),and%20amortization%20to%20net%20income)

\- [Price-to-free Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetofreecashflow.asp)

\- [Price-to-owner-earnings](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/p2Owner_Earnings/PLA/Price-to-Owner-Earnings/)

\- [Debt-to-Equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp)

\- [Interest Coverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestcoverageratio.asp)

\- [PEG](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp)

The most useless financial metric by far that way too many people use is the [PE ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp), it is easily manipulated by accounting shenanigans, fluctuations in short term reporting and reinvesting companies such as Amazon. The PEG ratio also suffers from this but is better as it factors in growth.

Here's an intro to relative valuations by Aswath Damoradan:

# 5. Psychology of Investing

You should work on your own psychology to investing as soon as possible when you start investing. This will allow you to not panic sell during dips and crashes or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) during market rallies.

This is perhaps the most overlooked section, most investors never bother to get their psych in order which is a big mistake usually because of overconfidence of their own abilities.

# 6. Screeners

You should learn how to use screeners to narrow down stocks within your circle of competence and to the ratio's that you learned about in section 2. You want to screen for stocks that have below a certain threshold in x ratio, for example \`PEG < 1\` which will screen all stocks for you that have a PEG of less than 1 (A PEG of < 1 is theoretically undervalued...sometimes). It's best to combine multiple ratio's together to really narrow down to a select few companies to look at. This saves a bunch of time in finding potentially good companies.

The ratio's I like to use were all mentioned in section 2.

# 7. Value Investing

The easiest way to make money long term in the stock market is to simple buy undervalued stocks, this ties into value investing. It's a simple concept where if you buy something undervalued then sooner or later the market will realize it's undervalued and correct accordingly (most times, sometimes it can stay undervalued forever). A lot of people mistake value investing for price to book ratio or some trash ratio like that, value investing is simply the concept of buying a stock for less than its intrinsic worth (i.e a margin of safety).

You **must** read the following books:

1. [Benjamin Graham - Intelligent Investor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Practical/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=intelligent+investor+edition&qid=1608384157&sr=8-3)
2. [Benjamin Graham - Security Analysis, Sixth Edition](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Security-Analysis-Foreword-Buffett-Editions/dp/0071592539)

These are the staples of value investing and what Warren Buffet read multiple times. They are difficult and long books to understand at first which is why I have put them in the 6th section so don't worry if you don't understand everything at first.

# 8. Accounting

To be able to read Financial Statement numbers you really need to know how accounting works, both for GAAP (U.S) and IFRS (Most of Rest of World).

The reason why you should know accounting is not only to spot red flags in financial statements but also to understand the downsides of accounting. For example, only recently in 2018 were companies required to include Capital Leases in their balance sheets liabilities. Before then, companies could hide it in Off-Balance sheet statements that few people looked at, grossly inflating the viability of some businesses with heavy lease requirements.

* [Howard Schilit - Financial Shenanigans, How to Detect Accounting Gimmicks & Fraud in Financial Reports](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Financial-Shenanigans-Accounting-Gimmicks-Reports/dp/0071703071)

David Krug's courses are an in depth full courses on accounting. You may not have the time to learn accounting in full though so if you do not then I would recommend the Accounting 101 course which fast tracks you to learn only what you need for our purposes.

Howard Schilit's book will give you a good overview into the most common financial accounting tricks that you can try and spot.

# 9. Monte Carlo Simulations & Data/Statistics

This section is completely optional and not necessary but allows you to fine tune your assumptions.

So monte-carlo simulations are simulations that run thousands of times on your valuation models (such as your DCF model) to simulate multiple cases in your models. So instead of just doing a bear case and a bull case in your DCF model you can run a monte-carlo simulation and give your boundaries for your inputs (e.g 25% with a std. deviation of +/- 5%) and you will get a range of different outputs, in our case estimated prices per share and then you can use the mean price as your estimated price per share.

# 10. Useful DD's and Blogs
One of the ways I find new stocks to look into is by reading blogs and posts about undervalued stocks. Here's a couple that I like:

- [DK Value Investing Stocks](https://dkvalue.blogspot.com/)
- [Aswath Damodaran Blog](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/)
- [Stock Chartist](https://thestockchartist.com/pages/value-investment-strategy)
- [Macro ops Research](https://macro-ops.com/research/)
- [UK Progressive Research](https://www.progressive-research.com/research-centre/)


Well... if you've made it this far then congratz. It's a lot to learn, basically a full time job to learn all of it. And that's the point, if it was easy everyone would be rich.

A final point is that a lot of the above links are from prof. Aswath Damoradan. The reason is that I have found him to be the absolute best source of information in regards to valuation ever and everything he publishes is completely free.

1gqy05k,2024-11-14,2024-11-14 00:41:07,A few observations on Mr Market from an Old Timer,"I'm 57 and long retired.  I've been in the markets for almost thirty years, twenty of those years as a professional (hedge funds, PE and a bit of investment banking).  I've always had a value mindset and thus I've been skeptical of growth-related hype.  So a few observations... worth exactly what you're paying for them.

At the peak of the 2000 internet bubble the top-10 companies (by market cap) in the S&P were worth 10.1% of then-global GDP.  Which was an outrageous valuation at the time.  Well, today that same figure is almost 17%.  Yup, almost 70% higher.  What does it mean?  I don't know.  But it probably means something.

I've witnessed three huge bubbles during my career: the Internet Bubble, the Everything Bubble I (prior to the Financial Crisis), and now the Everything Bubble II.  I have never seen anything like the current bubble - bullishness in all sectors just off the charts.  Caution trading at the biggest discount I can ever remember.  What does it mean?  I don't know.  But it probably means something.

My two biggest concerns with current market conditions are: (1) so much of the current conditions has been monetary driven - between the Fed, fiscal stimulus, and the other Central Banks' stimulus, there's just so much cash sloshing around the global jello bowl that it all has to go somewhere (and that somewhere has clearly been financial assets), and (2) the folks setting the prices in the most speculative assets don't appear to own the instruments they're trading in - they're just tossing them around hoping the ""number go up"" paradigm will never capitulate.  The only conviction is that someone will pay more for it tomorrow.  This has always been a feature of markets, of course.  But now it appears to be the *only* feature where a lot of the most prominent assets are concerned: Nvidia, Tesla, Bitcoin, etc.  (Tesla's entire market cap, for example, turns over every 30 trading days on average.)  What does it mean?  I don't know.  But it probably means something.

I've seen some crazy market conditions.  But this takes the cake.  If worldly wisdom teaches one anything,  however, it's that things can always get crazier.  We live in interesting times.

1d4t8x1,2024-05-31,2024-05-31 07:22:36,How I made 52% over the last year with stock picks in my Roth,"My strategy (it's not very deep):

1. I look for well-established stocks that have been suffering lately. Ideally, said stocks should have a solid history of consistent, if choppy, growth on the 5-year chart and maybe further.
2. I consider whether the stock is truly undervalued. I do some research on the industry, read up on some news about the company. I have two main checks. First, I imagine the likelihood of the company falling apart within a year or a few, absent of something extremely upredictable. If that thought is laughable, I then see if there is substantially negative news with lasting repurcussions to justify a sustained drop. If I see the business sticking around, with no news of the sort I mentioned, I go to the next step.
3. IMO, technical analysis is a weird self-fulfilling prophecy. Whether or not it makes sense, enough people trade off of it that it can be accurate, particularly with supports and resistances. So, I check if the stock price has consolidated or slightly rebounded from a support. If the stock has already tanked, but hasn't hit the next lowest support, I don't buy. I'll wait until it hits, and see if it stops dropping once it does.
4. Finally, I will monitor the stock after buying it, with alerts if it drops below the support I initially referenced. I'll sell if the support is broken and watch the stock when it hits the next-lowest one. That's how I dodged the last LULU drop and bought back in at $300. We'll see how that pans out with earnings coming up.

Stocks I recently bought: ULTA, SBUX, HSY, SHOP, CVS, NKE, LULU.

*Disclaimer: I've only been investing seriously for near two years, so we'll see if my strategy holds up in the long-run or if it's a load of bullshit. I usually hold my picks until it goes below the support, like I mentioned, or until it has gone up a few dozen percent at the least. I also make the occasional regard play, like a small bet on \*bank stock that shall not be named\* recovering after all the bank stuff last year. Spoiler alert, it didn't. My latest regard bet is ASTS at $7, so we'll see if that one pays off.*

1nblsgb,2025-09-08,2025-09-08 08:00:40,"The S&P500 is still underwater YTD, adjusted for currency depreciation","I am not trying to make any predictions here, but after the ""great crash"" of 2025 a few months ago, many people jumped the gun in saying: ""you see? it's all panic, stocks only go up"". I am heavily invested in Europe since last year and I have been warning that Trump would not be good for the US stock market. People did not believe me back then and do not believe me now. YTD, the S&P500 is up 9.7%. At the same time, the USD vs EUR is down -11%. If we add in inflation, it's even worse.

Right now, this bull market is sustained only by AI hype and not much else, with the mega caps outperforming the rest of the index, while recent job reports now suggest that the economy is going worse, hitting highest youth unemployment since May 2021. Perhaps the stock market will continue to go up, because higher unemployment means lower rates, but it also means inflation will probably be higher. If Trump gets want he wants with rates, turkey-style hyperinflation is not impossible. Given that the US government debt relative to GDP continues to compound, either the dollar goes down in value, or taxes need to go up, at some point. 

Damaging diplomatic relationships and putting in question the independence of the FED and meddling with the private sector (I am pointing at Trump saying that Intel's CEO should be fired, his decision to stop near-completed wind turbine projects being built in the US by Danish companies, his relationship with musk, saying he wants to lower the value of the dollar to make exports competitive....) is the worst thing he can do, since US bonds and stocks is one of the biggest exports that the US has. This is justified by the ""US exceptionalism"". But if this exceptionalism is put into question, that will have huge consequences. 

Regardless, what the FED does or does not do should not influence us as value investors, but my point remains: US exceptionalism is more than priced in already, and at current multiples, it is justified by AI, recency bias, and a tendency of investors to chase returns.

lbqzep,2021-02-03,2021-02-03 11:10:47,Michael Burry's Investment Strategy,"This will be long....Sorry in advance. I decided I'd like to research Michael Burry since I've seen so many people talking about him on here and this is just what I've discovered about him and his methods.

**Quick Facts:**

* Founder of hedge fund Scion Capital 2000-2008. Closed to focus on personal investments
* Best known for seeing the subprime mortgage crisis (2007-2010) and profiting from it
* Investment style is built upon Benjamin Graham and David Dodd’s 1934 book Security Analysis: ""All my stock picking is 100% based on the concept of a margin of safety.""

**Strategy:**

* Michael Burry's strategy as he states is not very complex. He tries to buy shares of unpopular companies when the look like roadkill, and sell them when they've been cleaned up a bit. Lets take a look at his Q2 2020 Positions, top buys, and top sells. There are a few that are not big surprises but check it out.

|Stock|Shares|Market Value|% of Portfolio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|GOOG / Alphabet Inc Class C (CALL)|80,000	| $113,089,000 | 35.87 |
| FB / Facebook Inc (CALL) | 93,200 | $21,163,000 | 6.71 |
| BKNG / Booking Holdings Inc (CALL) | 11,600 | $18,471,000 | 5.86 |
| GS / Goldman Sachs Group (CALL) | 73,600 | $14,545,000 | 4.61 |
| GME / Gamestop Corp | 2,750,000 | $11,935,000 | 3.79 |
| WDC / Western Digital Inc (CALL) | 270,000 | $11,921,000 | 3.78 |
| BBBY / Bed Bath & Beyond Inc | 1,000,000 | $10,600,000 | 3.36 |
| DISCA / Discovery Inc | 500,000 | $10,550,000 | 3.35 |
| TCOM / Trip.com Inc | 325,000 | $8,424,000 | 2.67 |
| QRVO / Qorvo Inc | 75,000 | $8,290,000 | 2.63 |

* **Top Buys**
   * GOOG / Alphabet Inc Class C (CALL)
   * FB / Facebook Inc (CALL)
   * BKNG / Booking Holdings Inc (CALL)
   * GS / Goldman Sachs Group (CALL)
   * WDC / Western Digital Inc (CALL)
* **Top Sells**
   * Jack / Jack In The Box Inc
   * FB / Facebook Inc
   * BA / Boeing Inc
   * MAXR / Maxar Technologies Ltd
   * QRVO / Qorvo Inc

Mr. Burry's weapon of choice is his **research** and that it's critical for him to understand a company's value before laying down a dime and that 100% of his stock picking is based on the concept of margin of safety introduced in the book ""Security Analysis"" which I am reading through right now and dang is it huge lol. He also states that he has his own version of their technique, but that the net is that he wants to protect his downside to prevent permanent loss of capital. Specific, known catalyst are not necessary. Sheer, outrageous value is enough.

He cares little about the level of the general market and puts few restrictions on potential investments. They can be large-cap stocks, small cap, mid cap, micro cap, tech or non-tech and finds out-of-favor industries a particularly fertile ground for best-of-breed shares at **steep discounts**.

**How does he determine the discount?**

* Focuses on free cash flow and enterprise value (Market capitalization less cash plus debt)
* Screen companies by look at enterprise value/EBITDA ratio. Accepted ratio varies with the industry and it position in the economic cycle
* If stock passes loose screen, looks harder to determine specific price and value of a company
   * Takes into account off-balance sheet items and true free cash flow
   * Ignores price-earning ratios
   * Return of equity is deceptive and dangerous
   * Prefers minimal debt
   * Adjust book value to a realistic number
* Invest in rare birds - asset plays, and to a lesser extent, arbitrage opportunities and companies selling at less than two-thirds of net value
* Will mix in with companies favored by Warren Buffet **IF** they become available at good prices. Deserving of longer holding periods.

**How many Stocks does he hold?**

* Likes to hold 12 to 18 stocks diversified among various depressed industries, and tends to be fully invested. Provides enough room for his best ideas and helps with volatility.
* Feels volatility is no relation to risk.

**Tax Implications**

* Not concerned much about tax. Know his portfolio turnover will generally exceed 50% annually, and at 20% the long-term tax benefits of low-turnover pretty much disappear.

**When he buys**

* He mixes barebones technical analysis into his strategy. 
* Prefers to buy within 10% to 15% of a 52-week low that has shown itself to offer some price support. If a stock other than a rare bird breaks a new low, in most cases he cuts the loss.
   * Balances the fact that he is turning his back on potentially greater value with the fact that since implementing this rule he hasn't had a single misfortunate blow up his entire portfolio

&#x200B;

>In the end, investing is neither a science nor an art - it is a scientific art.

These are the 2 months returns.","I'm more on the momentum/growth and generally the higher beta side of investment. After doing some reading and listening to many Youtube videos about value investing. And especially after knowing the one of the richest men in the planet got so rich by value investing. I decided that I need to test it.

The first problem is that I have never done it before and I just can't dump cash into a strategy I have never tested. And the second problem was that it's not easy for me to find and read multiple DDs about hundreds of companies in order to find which ones fall into the value investing category.

So I made a web application that does just that. It goes through the SP500 companies and finds which ones are undervalued, mostly stable and profitable. I want to share with you the stocks that it picked for me. In which I invested in a paper account. And the return on the demo investment since the first of July 2025. (2 Months)

|Ticker|Return (2 Months)|
|:-|:-|
|UAL|27.96%|
|APA|25.86%|
|DHI|24.29%|
|BLDR|19.56%|
|BKR|18.36%|

|ADSK|2.01%|
|F|0.09%|
|ACGL|0.03%|
|COR|\-3.03%|
|CMCSA|\-5.16%|

Given that the portfolio is equal weight, the 2 months performance is **+10.89%**

If I had done some DD. I would've probably allocated more cash to some of the stocks.

And the best thing is that my demo portfolio was mostly on the green most days. Sometimes even on day where both \^SPX and \^NDX were in the red.

Reality is an actual dip, like this one, is scary. The same thing happened during the Covid crash, 2008, etc. It’s not just a dip. People expected many businesses would go under. And many did.

So the next time you try to be smart in a bull rush taking all about buying the dip - remember it’s not so easy afterall… The dip is usually there for a very good reason. 

My advice? Wait it out a few weeks and look for stocks taking a heft beating that may not be so impacted by tariffs as one could expect.

And remember - trump has repealed many tariffs in the past.

You will end up writing pages of DD and doing fancy DCF valuations and it will be completey wrong because you just don't understand the future of the industry and business well enough

1lo4kq2,2025-06-30,2025-06-30 07:00:12,Top 10 things to do while the market is at all time high.,"
1. **Ignore the market.**

Value investors are bottom-up stock pickers. We buy undervalued stocks of companies. Not undervalued markets.

2. **Sharpen the saw** 

Read a book, learn about business models, competitive advantage, and how to value a company.

Eg. Learn how to DCF. This is a great time to learn how to do excel by creating your very own DCF. Remember, the value of a company is the sum of the future cash flows it produces discounted to the present. 

3. **Start an investment diary.**

Write down what you bought, sold, and also the why, and what will make you sell. 

4. **Learn other ways to value a company besides DCF.**

Like Relative Valuation. Like IRR method. Like Dividend Discount Model. 

5. **Sign-up with your local library.**

 And download the Libby app to read or to stream the digital audio book, Buffett’s Early Investment by Brett Gardner.

6. **Great time to tinker with screeners.**

Try something different this time, screen for quality instead of value. Or screen for value for international stocks.

7. **Watch your favourite Wall Street movies and laugh at the inconsistencies.**

Wall Street.    
Quick Silver.   
Trading Places.   
Bonfire of the Vanities.  
The big short.   
Barbarians at the Gate     
Wolf of Wall Street.  

8. **Pick up a cheap HP 12c calculator** and learn how to do NPV and do financial maths in reverse polish notion. 

9. **Go and investigate why are there at least three versions of EPS** by financial websites and which is the one that you trust. Here are three you check that are almost definitely different: market screener, yahoo finance and Market Watch. 

10. **Check the Barron’s or WSJ websites for stocks selling at 52-week lows.**

Eg from last Friday’s trading: 

Molson Coors,     
Campbell,     
Kraft Heinz,   
Conagra Brands,   
are all trading at one year lows.

It might be a good idea to keep a big cash position. The following catalysts are hurting US  stocks:

1.	⁠⁠Weak / unpredictable / volatile dollar 
2.	⁠⁠Cancellation of inflation reduction act
3.	⁠⁠Stubborn inflation (dovish Fed)
4.	⁠⁠Increased unemployment
5.	⁠⁠Trade / tariff war
6.	⁠⁠US reputation in the world is declining

Europe and China are better places to invest right now.

There are no positive catalysts for US stocks at this point. Most US companies will not be in a better place 3-4 years from now.

There have been times… well initially I had 70, several times I had 75% of my net worth in one situation.

There are situations you will see over a long period of time… I mean you will see things that it would be a mistake if you’re working with smaller sums, it would be a mistake not to have half your net worth in.

I mean you really do sometimes in securities see things that are lead pipe cinches and you’re not going to see them often, and they’re not going to be talking about them on television or anything of the sort, but there will be some extraordinary things happen in a lifetime where you can put 75% of your net worth or something like that in a given situation.

1id54hz,2025-01-29,2025-01-29 16:27:23,"Are you an expert in your field of work? If so, which stocks in that sector are you bullish on?","Hey! Occasional forum lurker, but first post here.

Warren Buffet said he only invests in companies he understands. But the world is becoming more global, interconnected and specialized - I think most people would agree it's easier to understand what Coca-Cola or Starbucks do than what eg. Broadcom does. We also don't have access to our own research teams like professional investors do. What we do have, however, is communities like this where the sum of our combined knowledge is enormous. So I thought of a concept (sorry if it's been posted before) - if you are an expert in your field, share with us any stock(s) you are bullish on and think will beat the S&P500 over the next 5+ years. Preferably outline why you think so, ie. elaborating on its bull case/moat and potential risks, while considering the current valuation.

I'll start. I work as an endocrinologist in Europe. That is, a medical doctor specialized in hormonal and metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity. I'm bullish on Novo Nordisk. Here's why.

The new class of GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs are the closest thing we currently have to miracle drugs, without wanting to sound sensational (consult your own doctor before starting it lol). There are currently only two players in the town: Novo Nordisk with its Semaglutide, and Eli Lilly with its Tirzepatide. Let's look at what these drugs do: Semaglutide reduces HbA1c (long term blood sugar) by around 1,7 % in type 2 diabetes which is amazing, vs. Tirzepatide's 2,1 %. Weight loss is around 15 vs 21 % after around 1,5 years - although recently NVO did a study on 3x the current approved upper dose of Semaglutide showing 20 % weight loss. Both drugs have studies proving effect on heart failure, chronic kidney disease (Tirzepatide only through other studies, not a study designed to look at this specifically although it is under way) and metabolic fatty liver disease, although I don't know the exact effect sizes here. Only Tirzepatide has study data on obstructive sleep apnea (also NVO's old Liraglutide), but this should be a class effect secondary to the weight loss. Only Semaglutide has a large study demonstrating a reduction of cardiovascular events like stroke and heart attack (the SELECT study), which was large, independent of the weight loss effect and rather sensational when it came out. LLY's study on this, SURPASS, is currently underway and I'd guess this is also a class effect. Semaglutide has shown promise on alcohol and drug use disorders and studies are underway. Preliminary data implies that the GLP1 class can also reduce the risk of dementia, at least in diabetics (which tbh is expected when you lower the blood sugar and might not be a specific effect of GLP1s). As you can tell by the aforementioned, the market is f\*cking huge for these things, and far from being saturated. Diabetes type 2 has a prevalence of 5-10 % in most populations, and obesity >25 % in many countries. On these 2 indications alone, which they currently have official indications for in Europe (only recently Sema and Tirze got FDA approval for chronic kidney disease and sleep apnea respectively), they have struggled to meet demand. Tirzepatide only came to Europe some months ago as LLY have struggled to supply its domestic market, while there have been shortages of Semaglutide for over a year in Europe. This is also while many countries, at least in Europe (idk how Medicare works lol) have not covered Semaglutide for obesity, due to the huge costs it would be for the governments (remember most countries outside US have universal health care afaik). A month's worth of Semaglutide in my country is about $250, which many people won't pay for themselves, thus limiting demand. These drugs also stop working when you stop taking them, causing the weight to be regained over time, which obviously is a huge plus to the pharma companies.

Okay, so an enormous market that's far from being saturated. There's clearly room for both these two players, and it doesn't matter that Tirzepatide appears to be slightly better if it's unavailable either due to demand exceeding supply or due to higher pricing. So what about up and coming drugs? LLY's Retatrutide shows weight loss in the region of 25 % which is amazing, whereas CagriSema (Semaglutide + an amylin agonist called Cagrilintide) showed a ""disappointing"" 22 % weight loss after a company had predicted over 25 %. This caused the stock to plump over 20 % before New years, which I think is such an overreaction based on the aforementioned stuff. Also, the study did only have 57 % of the participants on the max dose at the end. This might be a concern if indicates more side effects, but another possibility is because the study was designed to be like real life where if a patient gets adverse effects the clinicians are lenient to let them lower the dose - many people can in real life not tolerate the highest doses. If so, very ethical and nice of the company, but bad for shareholders since it might have costed them the 25 %. Anyway, the stock rebounded by around 10 % last week when their latest drug, Amycretin, showed around 20 % weight loss after only around 30 weeks, which is probably even better than Retatrutide. All in all, I'd hold Lilly slightly ahead of Novo right now as a company alone, but not by much. Let's look at the valuations then. Revenue is about the same, but LLY has a market cap thats about twice as large. In other words, almost twice the P/S (10 vs 18). NVO has significantly better margins, which means that P/E is even more discrepant (28 and 22 forward vs 86 and 35 respectively). NVO has much more cash and free cash flow, while only sligthly more debt. Looking at the valuations and putting it together with the products, I think NVO is a way better pick than LLY. Non-GLP1-portifolios are, I think, rather similar between the companies. NVO has the better long acting insulin in degludec, their rapid acting insulins are about the same in Fiasp and Lyumjev, Lilly has more non-diabetes stuff that I'm not familiar with, while NVO has in very preliminary animal studies made a ""smart insulin"" that only works when the blood sugar is high and is ""switched off"" when it becomes normal/low. Absolutely huge if it can work in humans, but extremely early, so not attributing this too much value atm.

So what about the bear case? In the absence of the scenario where data in 5-10 years show increased cancer risk from GLP-1 agonists (cancer takes like 20-30 years to develop so getting this data would take time), which I think is unlikely based on animal studies, it's mainly about the competition. Many other pharma companies want a piece of the cake and are close to releasing their own GLP-1s, like Boehringer Ingelheim, Amgen, Pfizer and some Chinese company. These show about 20 % weight loss, so probably good stuff, but at the time they will be released both LLY and NVO will probably have superior products in Retratrutide and Cagrisema. But even more importantly, they will probably have a way larger production capacity due to their head start. On this matter, NVO is expanding its US production so I'm not worried about potential tariffs.

For these reasons I think NVO will continue to have immense revenue and profits from these products for at least 5 years, and probably much longer since they're also ahead in the R&D department. Based on history, I also have faith in NVO continuing to innovate beyond Amycretin. They invest huge amounts in research.

I was lucky to buy the dip before the Amycretin data made it pop 10 % last week, but I'd still say this company is rock solid and a good buy at this valuation. It probably won't be a 5- or 10-bagger, but I'm confident it'll beat the S&P500 over the next 5 years. Do your own DD and remember to diversify, I'm not a financial advisor and anything can happen in the market.

* Minimal attention to actual cash flows

But the mechanics of how this company operates have some concerning similarities, and I can't shake the feeling that it's a massive house of cards.

I was so curious that I decided to research it and make a post about it, here are the main points from that post that I found out:

* **Their actual business is basically irrelevant.** MicroStrategy is a software company, but its revenue from that has been flat or declining for years. The entire bull case is 100% about Bitcoin, which means the company itself doesn't actually *create* any value. It's just a container for a single asset.
* **It's a ""Perpetual Dilution Machine.""** They use debt and continuously sell new MSTR shares to buy more Bitcoin. Because the stock trades at a massive premium to the Bitcoin it holds, they're essentially using new investors' money (who are paying a premium) to increase the Bitcoin-per-share for existing holders. It's a cycle that only works as long as new buyers keep piling in at inflated prices.
* **You're paying an insane premium for BTC.** When you buy $MSTR, you're not just buying Bitcoin. You're paying a huge markup. People have calculated it to be a 2x premium or even more at times. Why would anyone do that when you can just buy a Bitcoin ETF (even a leveraged one) for a fraction of the cost and get more direct exposure? It makes no sense.
* **The whole thing relies on Michael Saylor's salesmanship.** Michael is a charismatic speaker, but he has a history (look up their stock in the dot-com bust of 2000) of leading investors off a cliff with big promises. It feels like the entire valuation is propped up by his cult of personality and the belief that ""number go up,"" rather than any sound financial reasoning.

This is just a summary to save time, but if you are interested in the full analysis I'll link the post and 40 minute podcast here: [https://tscsw.substack.com/p/dont-buy-microstrategy-inc-mathematically](https://tscsw.substack.com/p/dont-buy-microstrategy-inc-mathematically)

It just feels like this entire operation is designed to enrich early shareholders at the expense of everyone who buys in later. The structure is unsustainable and seems designed to collapse spectacularly once the hype dies down or Bitcoin has a serious correction.

The legendary investor, 94, opens up about his decision to hand the top job to Greg Abel; ‘How do you know the day that you become old?’

By 
Karen Langley

May 14, 2025 at 3:24 pm ET

Warren Buffett can’t put his finger on exactly when he decided to hand over the reins of Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B -1.66%decrease; red down pointing triangle to Greg Abel.  

But in recent years Buffett observed just how much energy his appointed successor brought to each working day. And how his own days had slowed. The two men were operating at different speeds—increasingly so.  

“There was no magic moment,” Buffett, now 94, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. “How do you know the day that you become old?”

Berkshire shareholders and onlookers have long wondered how anyone could replace Buffett, for decades a towering figure in American business and finance. But as he passed his 90th birthday, Buffett began to experience something most people come to accept much earlier in life: his age.

1fgtqj2,2024-09-14,2024-09-14 15:21:36,What I learned about AI Over the Last Year,"For about a year now I've been trying to learn more about what AI can really offer to the economy.  I don't have a tech or engineering background.  In conversation with tech guys, I'd get met with, ""WHAT?  HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE THE VALUE OF NVIDIA'S GPUS???""  There is never an explanation of what AI is supposed to do for company ABC and why its stock should trade at a multiple of 80 for it.

In the past year of my research work, I learned quite a few key points that I thought I would share in one spot today, stuff about the AI economy and what role different companies play:

**Semiconductors**

GPUs are better for AI than CPUs.  While invented for the toll of processing visuals in video games, the GPU's general feature is being able to process parallel tasks.  CPU processing is more like a straight line.  AI runs better on a GPU because of that difference.

Even among GPUs, there are differences.  For AI purposes, their are two basic processes: 

1. Training: Essentially the ""deep learning"" part, where AI is fed data or trial-and-error to build its model.

2. Inferencing: Where AI, equipped with a model, assesses situations and applies it in real-time.

Nvidia's chips are much better for training, but AMD's are better for inferencing.  While trends and cycles for AI are not yet clear, the consequence for investors is that NVDA and AMD may rise and fall on the same cycles.

Intel essentially has almost no way to compete with this, but they continue produce most of the semiconductors out there for everything else we still use.  Because they had fallen behind, Pat Gelsinger came into try and turn Intel around, mainly by building up its foundry business.

**Foundries**

On that note, NVDA and AMD do not manufacture the entire chip, just their proprietary components, as do other businesses.  The silicon wafers that go into the chips are manufactured at a foundry.  Intel has its own vertically integrated foundries, but NVDA and AMD do not, making them ""fabless.""  Taiwan Semiconductor Company is the global leader in this spot, as a foundry pure play.  They control roughly 60% of the global market.  Companies like ASML, meanwhile, design and manufacture the machines that are used at foundries.

Intel hopes to develop its foundries beyond its own capacity and to sell this service to fabless makers, which includes folks like Nvidia and AMD.  Many doubt how consistently they would be willing to do business with a major competitor, so now there is talk that the Intel foundry business might be spun off into a separate entity.

The foundry-level stuff is more capital intensive, and this is why NVDA and AMD have seen much more appreciation and higher multiples.  They have no capex committed to the foundries and can increase volume at margins that feel like printing money.  Foundry-level companies still enjoy high volume, but their tighter margins have generally led to less of a premium than the likes of NVDA or AMD.

**General Businesses**

That's just the semiconductor side.  Why does AI make them money?  They answer is that most business can shave millions off of the operating expenses or increase volume with AI.  AI can speed up repetitive tasks or can find data trends in their business that were previously not possible, thereby improving a company's strategy.

So almost every sales team for every industry can get more bookings.  Almost every shipping route and warehouse will move goods more efficiently.  Of course, entirely new software services will be able to exist too.

**Data Centers and Cloud**

Whether these companies use cloud services or their own internal systems, this means data centers are being built and scaled up like never before to support the processing these GPUs will do.  Companies like Dell and HP can offer server products to this end.  Oracle offers cloud services that are ideal for training.  Even electric companies have a role to play in supplying these data centers with energy, 24/7.  Some nuclear companies are being considered as a green alternative, as solar and wind are not constantly available.

**Data and Analytics**

Lastly, there's stuff to consider on the data side, both collection and analytics.  Palantir has led the way in analytics for 20 years, and they are positioned to perfect their own art with the enhancements of AI.  Other businesses with proprietary data or means of harvesting them now have a more valuable product to sell for AI-training.  A good example are satellite companies that gather data from orbit.

Almost none of this I learned from a tech dude who had bought NVDA or AMD and was ""right"" about it.  I learned this by reading 10Ks, 10Qs, listening to conference calls, investor slideshows, and other sources.  This is a rough summary of a very layered topic, but I hope some of you find it helpful in your investing journeys.",421,63,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fgtqj2/what_i_learned_about_ai_over_the_last_year/,all,Investing Tools,0.98

17iswi3,2023-10-28,2023-10-28 22:05:53,Is passive investing causing a massive bubble?,"With the current performance gap between the magnificent 7 and the rest of the market, I've been reading about passive investing and the problems that this investment strategy might be creating for the broader market.

Michael Burry has long been a critic of passive investing:

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/04/the-big-shorts-michael-burry-says-he-has-found-the-next-market-bubble.html

> Passive investments such as index funds and exchange-traded funds are inflating stock and bond prices in a similar way that collateralized debt obligations did for subprime mortgages more than 10 years ago, Burry told Bloomberg News in an email. When the massive inflows into passive vehicles reverse, ""it will be ugly,"" he said.

> ""Trillions of dollars in assets globally are indexed to these stocks,"" Burry said. ""The theater keeps getting more crowded, but the exit door is the same as it always was. All this gets worse as you get into even less liquid equity and bond markets globally.""

This article discusses some more issues on passive investing in relation to an academic paper (linked at the end) that Burry has mentioned before:

https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/why-are-financial-markets-so-volatile

> The conventional wisdom, embodied in the efficient-market hypothesis, holds that market prices reflect the fundamental value of the underlying asset. But increasingly, research is identifying another force as being important: investor demand that may or may not be informed.

> At the heart of their argument is a new description of the stock market, which has been transformed over the past few decades by the rise of index funds and other large, slow-moving investors.

>  In the inelastic markets hypothesis, money that flows into the stock market leads to stronger price effects because there are essentially a set number of available shares, and many of those are not being actively traded. Pairing their theory with an empirical analysis, the researchers estimate that every $1 put into the market pushes up aggregate prices by $5.

> The inelastic markets hypothesis raises questions, one of which is: If flows have a larger impact on prices than standard theories allow, how many of those flows are still made on the basis of fundamentals?

All this to say, passive investing might be causing some issues in the market that are not necessarily good, especially for those that try to invest based on fundamentals. With the current valuations and size of the magnificent 7, future returns could end up being much lower than the indices have historically been known for. Small caps and value stocks are at risk of being ignored due to their low weightings in funds and less capital being devoted to active investing compared to passive flows. As passive investing continues to grow, fund flows will go to overvalued companies not based on fundamentals, but because of large market cap weightings.

1h28d43,2024-11-28,2024-11-28 18:20:07,The TRUTH I learnt from Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger,"# 1. The system is rigged

The financial industry thrives on overcomplicating things to justify fees.

As Charlie Munger said:*""The whole damn system is corrupt... everyone wants easy money, fast. And that requires a big fee.""*

Think about it: there’s **$2 trillion** locked in mutual funds charging **2% fees** while underperforming cheap index funds like the S&P 500. Who’s really winning here? Hint: it’s not us.



# 2. Temperament beats intelligence

Investing isn’t about being the smartest—it’s about controlling your emotions.

* Warren Buffett: *""The most important quality is temperament, not intellect.""*
* I read a study of a fund that averaged an **18% annual return**, but the **average investor in that fund lost money** because they tried to time the market.

**Lesson:** Fear and greed will destroy your portfolio faster than any bad stock pick.



# 3. The S&P 500 is your cheat code

Here’s your free investing hack: **buy the S&P 500 and chill.**

* Low fees.
* Decades of growth.
* Outperforms **98% of funds** consistently.

Even Charlie Munger admits:*""Wealth managers have almost zero chance of beating an unmanaged index like the S&P.""*

So why do people chase stock-picking glory? Because too many investors confuse excitement with success.



# 4. Picking stocks is really hard

Think it’s easy to find the next Tesla? It’s not. And even if you do, good luck getting in before the hype.

* Buffett: *""If you can’t value the stock, you can’t invest in it. You can gamble on it, but you can’t invest.""*
* Most people buying stocks have never even read a balance sheet.

**Picking winners is possible, but it’s incredibly hard—think Charlie Munger-level hard.**



# What this all means

The truth is, the game is rigged for most people to lose. But that doesn’t mean you can’t win.The winners aren’t the ones chasing hype stocks or flexing their ""10-baggers""—they’re the ones quietly compounding wealth by staying disciplined and focusing on what works: **consistency, patience, and a solid strategy.**

- GCP with increasing AI usage and custom TPUs.
- YouTube + Ads : worth more than NFLX on its ownband growing in the AI content boom era.
- AI Tools in Advertising
- AI in search AI Mode and Overviews are making search sticky.
- Android : Mass AI distribution potential for today. 
- Android XR : AI device launch vehicle with Glasses and Headsets, future looking platform. Already has Samsung, XReal, Sony as partners.
- Waymo : Only operational self driving fleet with paid rides.
- Quantum Computing : SOTA quantum processor in Willow and long standing research.

Negatives :

1i6jjjo,2025-01-21,2025-01-21 09:17:21,How I Find 2-10 Bagger Stocks,"I look for undervalued businesses—companies that generate strong cash flow, have durable advantages, and are selling for less than they’re worth.  
  
Here’s how I find them.  
  
1. The Screener: My First Filter  
I start with a stock screener. Finviz is my go-to, but sometimes I use [stockanalysis.com](http://stockanalysis.com) .   
I use these filters targeting mostly mid caps as these have a longer growth runway:  
  
✅ P/E Ratio Under 20 – If I’m paying more than 20x earnings, I better have a damn good reason.  
✅ Forward P/E Under 15 – I want earnings growth at a reasonable price.  
✅ PEG Ratio Under 1 – Cheap stocks with strong growth potential.  
✅ EPS Growth Past 5 Years Over 30% – I want companies that are getting stronger, not stagnating.  
✅ High Insider Ownership – If the CEO isn’t betting his own money, why should I?  
  
This weeds out the noise. What’s left? Stocks that are cheap, growing, and run by people with skin in the game.  
  
2. Dataroma: Superinvestors & My Own Research  
I track Dataroma weekly. It tells me what top investors are buying and selling. But I don’t blindly copy trades. I piggyback on their ideas, then do my own research to determine if a stock fits my strategy.  
  
When I see a company that looks promising, I dig deeper:  
  
Why is it undervalued?  
Does it fit my investing principles?  
What’s the downside risk?  
How does it compare to other opportunities?  
If it checks my boxes, I buy. If not, I move on.  
  
3. 52-Week Lows: Hunting for Mispriced Assets  
Every week, I check stocks hitting 52-week lows. Markets overreact. A great business can drop 30-40% on short-term fears, but if the fundamentals are intact, it becomes a value play or an asset play.  
  
I look for:  
✅ Stocks within my circle of competence – I don’t buy what I don’t understand.  
✅ Companies unfairly punished by market sentiment – The goal is to buy strong businesses at weak prices.  
✅ Hidden assets – Sometimes, a stock’s valuation ignores valuable real estate, brand power, or patents.  
  
This is where I find bargains the market has temporarily forgotten.  
  
Final Thoughts: Discipline Over Noise  
I don’t buy just to buy. I let screeners, Dataroma, and 52-week lows guide my research, but I always do my own work. I have other ways I find stocks that I will share in future posts!

1jfv8i1,2025-03-20,2025-03-20 14:03:55,Yet Another Financial Reporting Mystery at Tesla... (1.4 billion disappeared),"So, there is what the media says about this (pointing fingers and freaking out) and then there is what really happened.

So, looking at TSLA financial statements from 2024, we see they report $6.3 billion in fixed asset purchases (this is a very capital-intensive business of making cars, nothing in that alone is shocking). However, while $6.3 billion in cash went out the door, only 4.9 billion in fixed assets came back in. This, to me, is alarming for the misstatement but not for the impact. In reality, they should most likely have noted they are employing a highly aggressive expensing strategy (that's probably questionable but not illegal) or that they have losses due to exchange rates. They didn't note that, and that's a problem with the leadership and their knowledge of financial accounting which should bother TSLA investors (are the books reliable in other areas?), but it isn't really the headline it's been made out to be. This company has a history of producing financial reports which raise questions, but it has continued to be a going concern with a strong cash balance across that time...

\*\*\*\*

**I am going to however call TSLA out on the same thing I've posted about five times since 2022: Why are they issuing so much new debt?** This company does have a problem in the financial strategy wing in that they keep issuing billions and billions and billions in new debt even though they also report decent cash flows. There is a problem there - and investors are paying too high a premium even at today's prices for a company that can't take a pretty rosy cash flow situation and translate that into growth not fueled by costly debt.",398,73,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1jfv8i1/yet_another_financial_reporting_mystery_at_tesla/,all,Discussion,0.9

Instead, he took a risk and took the company in the new direction with the greatest deal of publicity. Changing their ticker, name, mission. All on display for the world to see, as if to say, look at me, look at us, place your eyes on our newfound identity.


It's very fitting, for the de facto social media industry leader to take this approach. Very fitting, for a once young and innovative Mark Zuckerberg to want to matter again, after years of declining market share and increased competition.


The issue is one that is shared among the modern investing world. One driven by jargon and VC capital endlessly pouring into the ""next big thing"". One where appearance matters much more than actual substance. You might even say this is reflective of society at large, perhaps even one where Zuckerberg helped mold. The issue lies in the fact that we live in a world where simply changing your name to include a buzzy new catchword such as crypto, NFT, or Metaverse can increase your company's valuation multiple times without changing much else.

Why?  
Because income statements are easy to dress up. Balance sheets? Not so much. They show what a business really owns, owes, and hides.

Here’s what Warren actually wants to see:

* Plenty of cash
* Little or no debt Rising retained earnings
* High return on tangible assets 
* Clean inventories & receivables If inventory is piling up or customers aren't paying, something stinks.

What he avoids:

* Massive goodwill with flat earnings - overpaid acquisitions.
* Ballooning intangibles with no real cash flow.
* Companies that look profitable but are drowning in debt.
* Creative accounting masks —-especially when the auditor notes are longer than the CEO letter.

It's all about Carbon capture technology. Both Chevron and Occidental are investing heavily in this area. Hollub has even suggested that if carbon capture proves successful, “there’s no reason not to produce oil and gas forever.”

Buffett acknowledges the risk, stating that the “economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven."" However, Buffett has made risky bets before, and they've often paid off. He's betting that Chevron and Occidental's investments in carbon capture will sustain the oil and gas industry, even as the world shifts toward renewables.

Buffett isn't just focused on short-term gains; he's looking at the long-term potential, particularly with carbon capture technology. If successful, this could transform the industry, making fossil fuels cleaner and more sustainable. That's why he's willing to put so much on the line. Buffett has seen industries change before, and he's positioning himself to be ahead of the curve once again.

If they were to spend that same money today at todays share price, they could purchase 7.3m shares or 70% more shares.  

What's worse is they've already spent another $200 million on share buybacks this year already at an average of approximately $100.  

Imagine if they'd just taken the safe route and put all this money into debt repayment. They'd be on track to being debt-free in the next 12 months or so. At which point they could probably just pay the stupidest dividend of 10-15% annually.


My honest opinion is the following: 

1. Investors have a tendency to overrate share buybacks and get overly excited because you're effectively seeing compounding in real-time. 

2. Buy back should be done conservatively. If a share price seems reasonable, then companies should err towards a dividend and definitely debit repayment if it exists.  For me, buybacks are more of a tool to hit the gas and put the metal to the floor when it makes sense. I own GigaCloud Technology, for example, and they bought back 4% of their company in the first six months of this year as people panicked over their share price (traded at 2x cash and 5x earnings lol). *That was a good use of buybacks*

3. If you ever see a company buying back its shares regardless of what's going on, it's a red flag, and you should be concerned.  $LULU for example, was buying back their shares at record multiples even with moderating growth. just why? Why not just pay a modest dividend?  This unfortunately means that every single share they purchased in the last five years was significantly above the share price today. 5 years of cash returns that have effectively lost anywhere from 30% to 50% of their original value.  

Anyway, I expect this one to be a little controversial, but it's something I've been thinking about a lot lately because I've become increasingly skeptical of the average CEO and CFO's ability to understand and how to properly value their business.  And thus make intelligent decisions with buybacks.",359,100,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1mlseme/crocs_bought_550m_of_shares_at_12794_in_2024/,all,Discussion,0.96

1mi4hh3,2025-08-05,2025-08-05 05:25:23,Sometimes it's that easy: ASML,"If you’re a long-term investor looking for a stock with a strong moat, healthy margins, predictable revenue, and exposure to a growing industry, I don't think there's a better stock than ASML. The company plays a key role in lithography, which is an essential part of chip manufacturing.

ASML holds around 80% of the DUV market (used for less advanced chips), where it competes with Nikon and Canon. More importantly, it has a monopoly in the EUV market (used for more advanced chips), as it's the only company with the technology necessary to produce them.

Despite short-term headwinds, ASML estimates revenue between €44 and €60 billion and gross margins of 56–60% by 2030. If we take the low end of that guidance and assume no margin expansion, we’re still looking at \~10% CAGR:

(44 - 28.2) / 28.2 = 56%, and 56 / 7 = \~8% CAGR.

If we include buybacks and dividends, the total return approaches 10% CAGR. In my view, a monopoly trading at 25x TTM P/E in a long-term growth industry with 10% assured growth is a very attractive deal.

Concerns people may have:

1. What if Trump’s tariffs impact the global economy and trigger the end of this chip cycle?

That’s a reasonable concern. If tariffs significantly hurt global GDP, companies like TSMC, Rapidus, Intel, and Samsung might cut capex, which would directly affect ASML. But you have to ask: what if it doesn’t happen? If nothing materializes, you’ve passed on a great business at a great price trying to predict macro events. If you want to take that risk, fine but it’s worth questioning.

2. What if ASML has a bad quarter and the stock drops further?

That could definitely happen. But trying to time that is closer to gambling than investing. Long-term, the fundamentals remain solid.

Competition from China:

I have no doubt that China will eventually develop EUV technology. Throw enough money at the problem, and you’ll solve it. But the questions are: when and how good will it be?

Here are three reasons I’m skeptical China will match ASML:

(1) Past failures in tech replication:

China has struggled to catch up in other critical tech sectors, jet engines, for example. Yes, EUV is arguably even more important, but this illustrates there’s a non-zero chance they won’t succeed, or won’t succeed soon.

(2) Timeline matters:

Even if China gets EUV, timing is crucial. A breakthrough in 20 years isn't the same risk as one in 5. ASML has been developing this tech since the late 1990s. Plus, ASML doesn’t build everything itself, it’s a system integrator (like Airbus or Boeing), relying on highly specialized suppliers like Zeiss, which has 100+ years of experience in mirror manufacturing. That’s not something you replicate overnight. And remember: there are \~5,000 suppliers involved.

(3) Experience = Efficiency:

Even if China gets EUV and starts mass production, their machines will likely underperform due to lack of experience. ASML machines have processed millions of wafers and are constantly improving. Chinese alternatives would likely have lower throughput and yield. And despite China’s large domestic market, I believe advanced-node fabrication outside China will remain bigger, further reinforcing ASML’s moat.

But even if the worst-case scenario plays out and China catches up in 5-10 years, you still end up with a duopoly. That’s certainly worse than a monopoly, but the export ban on EUV would likely be lifted by then, and ASML would have a bigger addressable market. Demand for advanced nodes isn’t going anywhere.

Happy to hear your thoughts, feedback, or pushback on ASML!",360,263,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1mi4hh3/sometimes_its_that_easy_asml/,all,Stock Analysis,0.94
1lr3k7n,2025-07-03,2025-07-03 19:04:29,Remember the Great Tariff Panic of April 2025?,"Now that it’s a few months out and we’ve gotten to see things develop, I think it would be a helpful exercise to look back on the events surrounding “liberation day.” The Trump administration’s widespread tariff implementation caused a real ripple effect in markets, leading to sell offs by even seasoned investors. The panic found its way to this sub, among many others. 

While a minority cautioned steady investment practices, and not to panic, a large majority came here with incredibly bearish opinions, some verging on outright economic apocalypse. We were told it’s time to get out. That this isn’t a typical economic event, or pull back. That Europe, and other emerging markets, would be a better place for one’s money. 

Months later, we can definitively say none of that was true. Those who stuck to tried and true investment principles weathered the storm, and many who decided to buy the fear have seen impressive returns. US markets have been surging as of late. New trade deals have created a “news ladder,” resulting in many bullish days as we see positive news developments on trade. All this should serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of group think, and the lack of diverse opinions on these Reddit subs. Too many people allow their biases, mob mentality, and political sentiments to dictate important investing behavior. Pls use the memory of this event to listen to others you might disagree with and insulate your investment strategy going forward. Don’t allow fear, group think, and market events to derail tried and true investment methods.

lppquu,2021-02-22,2021-02-22 09:48:34,Warren Buffett Quantitative Checklist - 5000+ Stocks Rated,"Hey everyone! I recently read a great book on Warren Buffett called Buffettology. The book lays out a whole set of criteria that Buffett looks for when buying stocks so I thought… alright, let’s see if we can grade all the stocks! Here, in this post, are the results. 

# The Rules

First, the rules. Each rule below receives a point for a pass, and no points for a fail, much like the Piotroski Score. The points were gathered from insights in Buffettology (I’d recommend a read if you haven’t already). 

* Rule 1 - Consistent Earnings (5yr / TTM growth > 0%)
* Rule 2 - Good debt coverage (can pay down debt in <3yr)
* Rule 3 - High Return on Equity (>15% average over 5yr)
* Rule 4 - High Return on Invested Capital (>12% average over 5yr)
* Rule 5 - FCF Generation (TTM FCF > $0)
* Rule 6 - Buying Back Shares? (Share count today < share count 5yr ago)
* Rule 7 - IRR greater than Long-Term Treasury (initial rate of return > 1.1%)
* Rule 8 - ERR greater than 12% (expected rate of return > 12% - calculated using analyst growth estimates)

Now, the data. Like always it’s in a Google sheet. I have ranked the stocks from 8 on down. If you’re interested in a particular stock, search for it within the document. 

# The Data

The data: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GLuUXKGBg7Rq0LgkdVPcybHKnsEl44eQ1cadtz84oZ0/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GLuUXKGBg7Rq0LgkdVPcybHKnsEl44eQ1cadtz84oZ0/edit#gid=0)

# Feedback

Got a rule you think should be in there, or something confusing about the score? Let me know. I make quirky things like this quite frequently for my YouTube channel (won’t link to avoid breaking any rules), and would love to take some feedback on continue iterating on this Warren Buffett checklist.",357,70,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/lppquu/warren_buffett_quantitative_checklist_5000_stocks/,all,Stock Analysis,0.99

1m1732j,2025-07-16,2025-07-16 04:20:20,ASML amazing earnings beats all metrics but tanks 7-8%,"Earnings this morning showed ASML Semiconductor to beat every single metric:

• Net bookings €5.5B (€1.3B beat).  
• Net sales +23% Y/Y to €7.7B (€0.2B beat).  
• Gross margin 54% (+2pp Y/Y).  
• Operating margin 35% (+5pp Y/Y).  
• EPS €5.90 (€0.75 beat).  
• FY25 Net sales +15% Y/Y (narrower range).

**The reason for the stock dump?** ASML warning for no growth in 2026 due to tariffs. A typical Dutch response that love to have a pesimistic outlook and **prefer to underpromise and overdeliver.** 

**Reasons to be optimistic:**

1. **ASML has a history of being underpromising and overdelivering**. The last 3/4 earnings ASML beat expectations yet the stock price went down directly after due to pessimistic guidance. **A typical Dutch mentality/culture thing.**  
2. **Future Outlook (Net Bookings) is the biggest beat**: Net bookings which shows demand for the future was the biggest **beat by more than 30%** from 4.2B > 5.5B.
3. **ASML biggest customers are winning**: Nvidea and AMD just went sky high due to good news from selling in China. This means demand for ASML products will only increase. 

**Reasons to be pessimistic:** 

1. IF Trump and EU not make a deal then tariffs will indeed hurt ASML. However, this seems very unlikely. ASML is one of the most important companies for the US, without their chips the top 10 companies will have supply issues that cannot be solved for the next 5 years at least due to high barrier for entry needed to do what ASML does.

$LULU currently trades at 13.8x NTM PE. If they hit analyst estimates at $15.6 in FY27 with a PE of +20x (still below historic levels), then $LULU is a $312 stock.

  
**2. Novo Nordisk | $NVO**   
  
$NVO has had a difficult year but they have a very strong presence in the diabetes and weight loss industries. They're also investing heavily into growth in Denmark, France, and NC to ride the growing obesity market wave.   
  
Currently trading at 14.6x PE whilst historically trading around double that. $113 would be a 100% move.

  
**3. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals | $REGN**   
  
$REGN is a slightly higher growth value play with a current NTM PE in the 14x range whilst historically trading for +20x PE. P/B is also at 2.0x (historically +4.0x).  
  
With minimal debt and a current ratio above 7.0x, they're quite a safe play in a period of macro weakness. Their portfolio includes eye diseases (EYLEA), chronic inflammation (Dupixent), and cancers (Libtayo) which will all necessary despite economic conditions.   
  
I like $REGN a lot - it's on my watchlist.

  
**4. Constellation Brands | $STZ**   
  
A recent Buffett addition to his portfolio in Q2 - $STZ currently trades at a 11.9x PE and a 10.5x EBITDA multiple with a 2.5% dividend yield. The alcohol industry tends to be more resilient in downturns than most industries.   
  
If $STZ can return to historic PE multiples in the +15x range then they should be trading at $204 given a $13.6 EPS (as per analyst estimates in FY26/27).

  
**5. Merck & Co | $MRK**   
  
$MRK is currently trading at a NTM PE of 9.3x , which is very low historically and also lower than the broader healthcare sector.   
  
FCF has been steady and has generally traded upwards over the last few quarters reaching $1.68 per share in Q2. If $MRK can generate $9.61 in EPS in FY26 (in line with analyst estimates), and we apply a conservative 12x multiple then $MRK should be a $115 stock.

1d141ex,2024-05-26,2024-05-26 11:38:21,The Best Investment You Can Make Is an Investment in Yourself,"I just started reading Gautam Baid's book ""The Joys of Compunding"" and the first two chapters of it gave a very obvious reason about why Buffett and Munger have such great track records over their career.

I just wanted to emphasize on one of the passages in the first chapter that gives you and idea of how real investing decisions are made over time. It is not through asking random people on Reddit what the most undervalued stock is.

**The Best Investment You Can Make Is an Investment in Yourself**

Most people go through life not really getting any smarter. But you can acquire wisdom if you truly want to obtain it. In fact, a simple formula, if followed, is almost certain to make you smarter over time. It’s simple but not easy. It involves a lot of hard work, patience, discipline, and focus.

**Read. A lot.** This is how Warren Buffett, one of the most successful people in the business world, describes his typical day: “I just sit in my office and read all day.” Sitting. Reading. Thinking 

Buffett credits many of his successful decisions to his incredible reading habit. He estimates that he spends as much as 80 percent of his day reading and thinking.

Once, when asked about the key to his success, Buffett held up stacks of paper and said, “*Read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.*” All of us can work to improve our knowledge, but most of us won’t put in the effort.

In Michael Eisner and Aaron Cohen’s book Working Together: Why Great Partnerships Succeed, Buffett talked about his and Munger’s fierce dedication to lifelong learning:

""*I don’t think any other twosome in business was better at continuous learning than we were.... And if we hadn’t been continuous learners, the record wouldn’t have been as good. And we were so extreme about it that we both spent the better part of our days reading, so we could learn more, which is not a common pattern in business.... We don’t read other people’s opinions. We want to get the facts, and then think.*""

1jtxjk6,2025-04-07,2025-04-07 17:58:19,We Have A Fire Burning in the Markets Somewhere -- This Is Not Just Smoke,"Today, the VIX has closed just under 47. This is a clear signal that this is not jut a run-of-the-mill downturn. To get the VIX that high, at least one meaningful player has looked down at the sheet and said **""oh hell… we can’t actually roll that position.""**

I expect that between Friday and today the following has begun to happen or seriously accelerated:

\- Derivative desks pulling risk

\- Dealers are compensating by widening bid/ask spreads

\- Vol-sellers are getting blown out

\- At least some hedge funds are running into **actual margin triggers**

We may also begin to have problems imminently with cross-asset plumbing, but that's a deeper topic not suitable for this initial post.

Right now, we are all in the lobby, and the policymakers are in the penthouse (Fed, White House, etc.). This VIX level tells us there are at least a few fires, but we do not yet know what floors they are burning on yet. We know that on some floors, at least a few people are ""breaking the glass"" and trying to fight it themselves by unwinding into cash or halting trading altogether -- these things must be happening for us to get to the volatility levels we are seeing -- liquidity is, for a fact, leaving the system (and fast).

I posted to r/StockMarket a few weeks ago that I could see large institutional players unwinding and using retail for liquidity. The day after I posted that, Trump floated the idea of trying to force treasury holders to roll into longer-term bonds. The tariffs are destabilizing but **I am just pointing out that the actual ""grinding on metal"" may be deeper and more systemic.**

Sadly, it was removed, but I still got a lot of suggestion in time and had some leads to research.  The 5 were: BABA, F, HOOD, RIO, and YUMC.  The format shall proceed like so:

* Summary of Operations
* Strategy

* Valuation

While deeper analysis is possible for some of these, the goal is a concise elevator pitch, in line with what Peter Lynch recommends when making decisions to buy or sell.  I included everything that I thought should satisfy a curious investor.  ***Once you're done, give me 5 more to research.***

# BABA

**Summary of Operations**

Alibaba is large, diverse, Chinese company with its own ecosystem of different enterprises it has developed or acquired. Let’s break it down.

* Core Commerce (86% Revenue):
   * Retail Commerce (Taobao and Tmall in China; Lazada, Kaola, and Daraz beyond)
   * Wholesale Commerce (Lingshoutong in China; Alibaba.com beyond)
   * Logistics Services (Cainiao and Fengniao)
   * Consumer Services (Ele.me, Koubei, Fliggy)
* Cloud Computing (8% Revenue) : Alibaba Cloud
* Digital Media and Entertainment (4% Revenue): Youku, Alibaba Pictures
* Innovation Initiatives: DingTalk, Amap

Several of these assets on their own are highly cash generative, experience high growth rates, have immense customer appeal, and are among the largest commercial platforms in the world. Thus, with a model similar to that of Amazon (also has individually popular enterprises in online and offline retail, shipping, entertainment media), the company offers a wide array of goods and services under a “single roof” that provide economies of scale, cost reduction, and convenience for the customer.

**Strategy**

Alibaba aims to increase the variety of its product offerings in order to draw in new customers outside of China and to draw more revenues from existing customers. For enterprises it acquires, it integrates them into its vertical operations, internal supply chains, cloud system, data analysis—all of which lead to operational optimization.

With low levels of debt and plenty of its own cash, Alibaba is continually adding to its existing infrastructure and maintains self-sufficiency.

**Growth and the Future**

Each of Alibaba’s assets are among the most globally popular, reputable enterprises of their kind and are leading the way in China’s and Southeast Asia’s consumer markets. By possessing these in a single ecosystem in developing economies, Alibaba is positioned to enjoy a windfall of cash from a rising middle class in the East. The company has over a billion customers now and aims to achieve 2 billion in the early 2030s.

While there is risk from Chinese regulators cracking down and trade relations with the world being unpredictable, this has always been the case for Alibaba and not impeded its ability to grow. I’ve read annual reports of companies who are limited and at the mercy of regulators in their section on Risk Factors, and this doesn’t seem to be the case here. While everyone is theoretically at the mercy of Xi Jinping in China, even this company, the real question is if he will think it is worth it to smash a player that is bringing his country into a golden age.

**Valuation**

Even with conservative assumptions, BABA appears undervalued. The company made $26 billion in free cash flow for the year ended March 31, 2021. While financial data for the year ending March 2022 has yet to come in, the current, quarterly data suggests that $20 billion very achievable. The company has been growing around 30% as well, which can’t last forever, but we can price in declining growth.

* Growth Assumption: 20% first five years, 15% next five.
* Intrinsic Value Per Share: $195

# F

**Summary of Operations**

Ford Motor Company is an American automobile manufacturer and financing company that sells cars and parts to independent dealerships around the world. Brands consist of Ford, Lincoln, and Ford-Lincoln. The company sold 8.1 million vehicles in 2021, with 52% sold in North America, 24% in Europe, and 15% in China. The autoindustry is cyclical, and Ford has had declining revenues the last few years. It typically accounts for about 12% of the North American market and 5% of the global market.

Ford Credit provides financing services and assists dealers in the sale of new cars. Most of its revenue comes from interest on retail installment sales and finance leasing. Ford is the only of the Big Three American car manufacturers that owns its own financing company, so while its balance sheet reports high levels of debt, most of this attributable to Ford Credit (high debt levels are normal for financial entities).

**Strategy**

Ford maintains a steady flow of car sales by maintaining the strength of its brand and operating globally. It retains relationships with dealers through the convenience of Ford Credit’s financing services. It hopes to build on these strengths with improved data analysis and integration of new tech into new models, as part of a “Global Redesign” project stemming back to 2018.

**Growth and the Future**

While Ford is a legacy brand, there is no obvious path for growth for such a mature company, nor does it have a moat or competitive advantage. It has the value of its brand and the ability to make decent cars, but several competitors have this as well. It depends the sale of larger vehicles for greater profitability, and it worries that a transition to smaller, electric vehicles (either from consumer demand or regulation) will limit its profitability going forward. Ford is also vulnerable to supply disruptions, and the semiconductor shortage has materially limited its productivity.

**Valuation**

* Growth Assumptions: 0%
* Intrinsic Value Per Share: $7.50 - $17

This is tricky. Using more normal ways to calculate free cash flow above, Ford is fairly valued. The adjusted free cash flows Ford has started providing the last few years (to rule out operating cash flows from Ford Credit) suggest only about half of current FCF.  This might actually make more sense, as financial companies’ operating cash flows are usually bad for valuation.  We could then also try to go by book value (and per share growth thereof) to account for that.  No matter what, Ford appears to be, at best, fairly valued.

# HOOD

**Summary of Operations**

Robinhood is a company with an online trading app that allows users to buy and sell assets for the purposes of investment and speculation, with the aspiration to “democratize finance.” It primarily draws revenues from transaction fees and receives marginal earnings from interest. The company intends to offer more than just trading services, being an ecumenical app for all financial needs, as a digital wallet, a bank account, and so on.

The company consistently operated at a loss from 2013 to 2019. Cash flows are currently negative, largely because operating expenses skyrocketed over the last year (up 266%), while revenues did not keep up pace (up only 89%). HOOD is a new stock, going public last July, and the company has raised about $2 billion in capital, which it must deploy intelligently in order to address these concerns.

**Strategy**

The company entices sign-ups with up to $500 of free stocks for referrals, similar to what a lot of digital wallets do with free money. From there, it hopes that the convenience of its app will draw people in and allow for several transactions. If it can integrate more financial services into its app, the convenience should increase, as should more sources of revenue.

**Growth and the Future**

I am skeptical of this company. Being the go-to finance app is a big ambition, and Robinhood really hurt its brand with how it handled the GME Squeeze last year. For those unaware, it halted trading for users in a way that (arguably) benefited hedge funds, potentially causing millions of dollars in losses for their own customers. Ouch.

Looking aside that temporary setback, let’s analyze their mission. They aim to “democratize finance,” and I believe this mission is already accomplished by other entities. For one, much of finance occurs in a market of companies whose shares are tradeable to public and whose shares are frequently split to make them affordable for a normal paycheck. That alone does most of their mission for them, and this has been a fact of life for more than a century, thanks to the laws of Western governments.

Two, plenty of other big names have always been “democratized.” First, banks let you write checks. Then they made ATMs. Then they made debit cards. They created websites where you could access your accounts. Many of these banks have since acquired or spun off investment firms as well, and other brokers like Vanguard and Fidelity have apps. Robinhood creates no clear value to give it a moat.

I think the GME Squeeze (and the huge rise of Opex) is a sign that the founders of Robinhood are in over their heads with a starry-eyed goal that they can’t execute, in spite of their growth in new accounts. To the extent that they democratize finance, it’s by making the gambling aspect of “investing” easier, and considering how many of these users joined in the middle of an asset bubble, I wonder if Robinhood will have many eager customers for all those transaction fees when it pops.

Read Peter Lynch. His parents’ generation was traumatized by stocks because of Black Tuesday and the Great Depression. Even after the Nifty Fifties, there weren’t a lot of people who trusted stocks. That’s the headwind that Robinhood and many companies with similar business models face. Where casinos and video game loot boxes are still fun for the gambler, markets are not.

**Valuation**

Because I do not see a future for this company, I will not perform a valuation.

# RIO

**Summary of Operations**

Rio Tinto owns and operates mines across the world that produce a variety of metal ores but primarily derives its income from the sale of iron and aluminum. The company has low debt, finances growth with its own cash, and pays most earnings to shareholders through dividends.

Here is a description of their more prominent assets.

* Iron: Pilbara Region, Australia, network of 16 mines, produces Pilbara Blend iron, nearly all of company’s Operating Cash Flows. Highly automated (efficiency, minimal injuries).
* Aluminum: A series of mines, smelters, and refineries in Canada for production of aluminum, alumina, and bauxite.
* Copper: They are currently working on an untapped copper project in Arizona, which they believe could meet about 25% of American copper demand, which continues to rise in demand.

**Strategy**

Since Rio mines and sells commodities, the key idea is to lower costs and to invest capital to achieve that, so that if commodity prices crash, they are still profitable—which the company tends to accomplish. Rio seeks to return value to shareholders primarily with dividends, typically at a payout ratio of 73% of earnings. This is the likely reason that current yield is 8.75%. While they don’t retain much for reinvestment, they do seem to make use of extra cash as prices rise to pay off debt and keep the balance sheet healthy, a good sign.

They use on-site power plants (typically hydro and solar) to meet their electrical needs and consistently reduce workplace injuries. About 22,000 (50%) of their employees are shareholders of the company, suggesting labor is reasonably aligned with the success of operations. Similarly, executive compensation is very structured and tied to productivity. This seems like a well-run company.

**Growth and the Future**

The average operational lifetime of their current sites is about 17 years each, so cash flows should be stable. Growth will likely come from rising demand and higher prices for iron and aluminum globally as more countries industrialize and urbanize, along with acquisitions of new mining assets. About five new sites will be operational in the next five years.

Much of current capex is on the copper assets, which are largely undeveloped. This is a project worth following, as the returns could be huge.

**Valuation**

With the high yield and payout ratio, it make sense to value this as a dividend stock.

* Growth Assumptions: 6%
* Intrinsic Value Per Share: $74

# YUMC

**Summary of Operations**

Yum China (YUMC) is an American restaurant company that operates in China. It holds branding rights for similar assets held by its sister company, Yum Brands, as well as its own, which include: Kentucky Friend Chicken, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang, COFFii & JOY, East Dawning, and Lavazza.

They have over 11,000 restaurants in China, most of which are owned directly by YUMC, while about 16% are franchised. KFC is the flagship brand, first opening in China in 1987 and becoming the most popular fast-food chain in the country, with over 7,000 locations.

**Strategy**

The company decides each restaurant’s location based on its individual merits, taking into account the area, financial potential, and impact to similar stores. All of its brands are supported by a common supply chain that has 25 logistics centers throughout China and vets the food and ingredients for quality.

The company claims to have identified 700 cities without a KFC or Pizza Hut and believes it can expand to 20,000 restaurants. It will add new locations of its existing brands and acquire more that it can incorporate into its ecosystem. Existing sites are well maintained to give customers a comfortable environment; 75% of KFC locations were built or renovated in the last five years.

Technology streamlines the customer service on top of this. Stores take payments on common platforms like Alipay and WeChat, making them very accessible. Online payments have also made delivery services very successful and are a growing revenue source. AI analyzes workflows to improve scheduling and inventory.

With a strong balance sheet, the company sustains its operations with its own cash.

**Growth and the Future**

The company’s growth lies in expanding its number of stores and eliminating costs by hybridizing its assets. It gained 1,286 stores in 2021 alone, so expansion to 20,000 seems reachable, yet this was on gross of 1,806 new stores. Why are they down almost 500 stores? That’s a lot of lost capex.

Concurrently, operating cash flows remain flat over the last few years. The latest quarterly earnings presentation emphasized new stores and expansion of delivery operations, but its glided over disappointing revenues.

New stores have been growing at a rate of about 8% per year. Even with the emerging middle class of China, the YUMC doesn’t seem to raking in that growth when it comes to the hard numbers. The company will need to realize more customers for these expansions to bear fruit. When will that happen?

**Valuation**

* Growth Assumption: 8% first 5 years, 6% second 5
* Intrinsic Value Per Share: $8.54

1nsd54h,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 22:36:03,One of the best performing tech stocks of all time is on sale. And it’s not the Mag 7. Or even in the US.,"Constellation Software ($CSU.TO / $CNSWF) is experiencing a rare drawdown, in fact, the largest drawdown since IPO back in 2006. The founder, Mark Leonard, has been known as Canadas Warren Buffet, and is touted as one of the greatest capital allocators of all time. His shareholder letters are of renowned status, and anyone who has done any amount of research into the company knows the management quality is unparalleled. 

Constellation Software's compounding returns have quietly outshone almost every other stock since its IPO, cementing its place as one of the all-time great performers, all without being a member of the ""Magnificent Seven."" The company's unique, decentralized, long-term acquisition strategy for mission-critical vertical market software has created a fortress of recurring revenue. The services provided are known by shareholders to be sticky and switching costs are high. The company maintains relationships with potential acquisitions and holds a record of over 50,000 companies to potentially acquire. Since IPO, only one company has ever been re-sold, and Mark Leonard says this was one of his biggest regrets. 

I believe recent drawdown is entirely overblown. Skepticism over the impact of AI on its vast portfolio neglects Constellation's deep, embedded and entrenched specialized knowledge and systems in niche customer workflows—an enduring advantage against generalized AI tools. Furthermore, the stock's plunge following founder Mark Leonard's resignation for health reasons, though understandable given his legendary status, discounts the company's established, deep management bench and decentralized acquisition structure, which was built for perpetual operation beyond any single individual. The long-term thesis remains firmly intact. Mark Miller, the new CEO, himself has over 30 years with the company, leaving little doubt to his performance capabilities. 

The company typically commands a high premium, usually at 35-40x forward FCF. However, with last weeks intense sell off, the 2026E FCF multiple is currently in the low to mid 20s. I think this presents a very compelling opportunity for a company that has historically compounded at 20-30%. 

I believe this is a very rare buying opportunity. Next week, Constellation is holding a meeting to discuss the recent resignation of Mark Leonard. Volatility will likely remain high. I currently own 52 shares and will consider adding more in this dip.


**EDIT:**

Added below is one of the comments I made regarding what I believe is the root issue with the AI bear thesis - 

This is where the core issue of the AI arguement is: VMS will only lose value if they lose their customers.

I'm highly doubtful that artificial intelligence, any time in the near future, will upend and displace niche mission critical vertical market softwares. Typically, the cost of these vertical market softwares as a proportion of revenue generated from the business is one percent or less. There's no way that a municipality, utility, government agency or a healthcare facility (all common customers of CSU) will suddenly want to exchange deeply embedded VMS software for a new random vibe coded artificial intelligence mess, which will be riddled with bugs, issues, errors and inefficienceis. CSU's softwares have over the years been custom tailored and designed for each specific industry and business. Further, while AI has been shown to be decent at generating new code for simple programs, it's quite bad at debugging and fixing issues and errors. Like one commentor put it, good for greenfield, bad for brownfield. 

Imagine having to retrain hundreds of employees on how to use a new software that's been used by the business for the last fifteen to twenty years. Then fix all the new bugs, issues and inefficiencies on top of that. And remember when I said, the expense for this software is <1% of their revenue? Are they going to go through this headache? No.

Real world example - I work as a physical therapist with a home health agency. We still use a software on our company mobile devices called ""HomeCare HomeBase"" that was made for Blackberries with a keyboard and stylus for use by nurses 15 years ago. We still use it today and it's still one of the largest home health softwares used by home health agencies in the US. It's the same concept. For these businesses, switching out the software is just not worth the disruption in business operations for at best a minor operational efficiency improvement and practially no cost savings.

Also, on top of all that, consider the opposite approach with AI for CSU. Wouldn't one stand to reason that with all the proprietary data and relationships CSU has with its customers, they would actually be primed to take advantage of the AI wave and improve their own software thats already in use by their customers? That's the other way to look at AI.",325,189,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nsd54h/one_of_the_best_performing_tech_stocks_of_all/,all,Stock Analysis,0.89

\- Amazon reduced 5.2%  
\- Aon reduce 5.4%  
\- Chevron reduced 10.4%  
\- HP reduced 15.2%  
\- Markel reduced 66%  
\- Globe life reduced 67%

\- Activision Blizzard  
\- General Motors  
\- Celanese  
\- Johnson & Johnson  
\-Mondelez  
\- Proctor & Gamble  
\- UPS.  
**3) Buffett is left holding quite a lot of cash, $157 billion:**

Please note that he needs to hold a lot of cash as a safety net for his insurance business. This amounts to around 20% of his total assets. $157 billion divided by market cap of $780 billion. Although it is a  record amount of cash it is still in line with his company’s 20 year average relative to his portfolio.

**4) This may align with his strategy of ""T-bill & chill"":**

Buffett probably has most of this cash in T-bills. Right now 3-month treasury bills yield 5.4%. This shows that he still has faith in the U.S dollar, and let’s just say I don’t think he’ll be switching to bitcoin anytime soon. One could argue Buffett does not mind having his money on the sidelines with a safe 5.4% return as opposed to the more volatile and pricey stock market.",325,154,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/17vz5vh/warren_buffett_is_selling_a_lot_of_stocks_in_late/,all,Buffett,0.92

I have performed an analysis of S&P 500 performance in relation to the index's price-to-sales ratio since 1928, and here is what I have found (all returns are with dividends reinvested):
1) When P/S ratio is <0.5, the annualized return over the subsequent 5 years is 12.1% yearly
2) P/S 0.5 to 0.8: 10.2% yearly return over 5 years
3) P/S 0.8 to 1.2: 8.8% yearly return over 5 years
4) P/S 1.2 to 2: 5.5% yearly return over 5 years
5) P/S 2 to 2.5: 4.4% yearly return over 5 years
6) P/S>2.5: we have no idea what the returns over 5 years are, because we are currently in the first period in 100 years where the P/S is > 2.5

Do with this information what you would like. Personally, I am holding what I own, but no longer buying. I have no idea when the drop will come, but the S&P will have to revert, at some point, towards its historical average P/S ratio of 1.71. That's 39.8% lower than it is currently.

1mkawl7,2025-08-07,2025-08-07 16:21:00,Why is Duolingo such a valuable company? I used this app and it’s unbelievable crap,"
I used Duolingo to learn Spanish, and this app is total crap when it comes to efficiency and the speed of learning a new language. It’s made for idiots.

In the first chapter, you’re supposed to learn like 10 words.
For example: Spanish words like hello, cat, dog, tree, etc. And yeah, it’s super easy to remember those with flashcards  you could memorize them in two minutes. But this crappy app makes you repeat or fill in the blanks with the same words 10 times.

It gets annoying and becomes a huge waste of time, but you’re forced to complete these idiotic exercises just to unlock the next chapter. And in the next chapter, you learn another word.
Each chapter takes around 10 minutes  not because the words are hard to learn, but because of these dumb exercises that make you type the same word over and over.

This app is only for beginners to learn basic words. You’ll never reach B2 or C1 level using it, and to even get to the advanced chapters takes hours or days  only after grinding through all the crappy beginner monkey-level exercises.

The app won’t teach you how to actually speak. It wastes way too much time on this repetitive clicking nonsense.

Buying a book is way more efficient and faster. Nothing is locked, you decide which words to focus on, which ones are easy, and your learning time is much faster. You can flip to any chapter without being forced to unlock previous ones.

I seriously don’t understand how this Duolingo app is so highly valued, and why its stock went up like 20%. It’s a crappy app that doesn’t actually help you learn a language but waste  your time more than you spent  with book

Warren Buffett Turns 95 Today. 10 of His Biggest Investing Lessons

By Andrew Bary
Aug 30, 2025 1:30 am EDT

Warren Buffett celebrates his 95th birthday on Saturday—marking a milestone of longevity and leadership at Berkshire Hathaway.

Buffett plans to step down as Berkshire CEO at year’s end after 60 years at the helm. He leaves an extraordinary legacy as an investor and manager.


He took control of a struggling textile company in 1965 and has turned it into the world’s largest conglomerate with a market value of over $1 trillion and annual after-tax operating earnings of about $45 billion.

Here are 10 lessons, or takeaways, from his long career. Investors may not agree with some or many of them, but they are worth considering.

**Don’t pay up for stocks.** Buffett generally doesn’t pay more than 15 times forward earnings for a stock. Even when buying growth companies like Apple nearly a decade ago or Coca-Cola in the late 1980s, Buffett bought them for under 15 times earnings.

**Don’t be afraid to take profits—even if it means paying a lot in taxes.** While Buffett preaches “forever” investing, the reality is different. Berkshire has cut its formerly huge stake in Apple by 70% and reduced its interest in Bank of America by 40% over the past year or so. In recent years, Berkshire has exited sizable holdings in JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group, Citigroup and Paramount Global among others. The only two “forever” stocks in the Berkshire portfolio could be Coke and American Express.

1eifsuy,2024-08-02,2024-08-02 13:21:56,Buy The Amazon Dip,"In counter to the ranging conversation on Intel, to me the obvious results from yesterday is buy the Amazon dip.

The street was looking for $148.8B revenue and they did $148.0B
However, earnings killed it.  They did $14.7 vs the street $13.6B

More than that, everybody was concerned that AWS wouldn't hit expectations after MSFT, and AWS did better.

The result?  Amazon falls 10%.

Very simply, Amazon is now trading in the 30s for a PE, which is clearly under their historical mean.  To suggest that this stock price makes sense, you need to argue the following:

* Amazon has systemic issues
* Amazon retail deserves a LOWER multiple that Walmart on EPS
* The Cloud market is going to crater, and deserves a multiple the same as retail

Now, when you have an event like this, you get a bunch of headlines that try to give a reason for the dip.  Some cite that the current quarter outlook wasn't as strong as what the street wanted.  However, this is often the case at Amazon.  Some cite that the revenues disappointed, but this really is fx, which should be a reasonable reason beyond Amazon's control.

However, this is not what I see.  Amazon delivers exceptionally well.  They continue to put pressure on all normal retail stores.  I only find myself buy more and more on Amazon, not less and less.  More people are buying online, and Amazon is still slowly gaining share.

So what do you have left?  Basically, the street wanted to see their internal advertising growth 24% year or year.  It ""only"" grew 20%.

To me, this is Mr Market missing the boat, and if you are wiling to do a sum of the parts and compare Amazon to their peers, this is a buying opp.",314,109,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1eifsuy/buy_the_amazon_dip/,all,Discussion,0.93
18m69u1,2023-12-19,2023-12-19 11:43:16,I think there is a general misunderstanding of how Chinese Companies work and why I will never buy one,"Hey guys,

&#x200B;

I've seen a lot of posts here asking questions about why BABA, PDD, JD, or other Chinese cos are so cheap.  I think that the issue is that this community is primarily Western (Europe/America) and people are applying a Western-normative narrative to the companies and not understanding the fundamental structure of these companies and why there is so much risk to investors here.

&#x200B;

I'll start by saying this, on the face of them, they are extremely cheap, I like Tikr as a screener and all of these companies screen cheap there - BABA is at 7.45x NTM FCF, JD is at 8.99X NTM FCF and JD is at 17.07X NTM FCF.  All of these are below market multiples and it seems like they will have a lot of growth in the future. 

&#x200B;

So, what is the problem? These companies seem cheap, they still have amazingly large markets they can appeal to, and I personally believe that even if China is going through a rough economic time currently, it will bounce back most likely.  I think to understand this, we need to understand how the Chinese market works and how this has translated in the past. 

&#x200B;

China's laws is that in general foreigners cannot own Chinese companies directly.  (there are nuances to this, but for simplicity's sake I am going with the rule that applies to most, if not all of the publicly traded stocks talked about here).  So because of this, Chinese companies set up what are called variable interest entities (VIEs) which are registered in the cayman islands.  So for BABA, if you go to their annual reports, you'll see that they are registered there: [https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US/ir-filings-sec](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US/ir-filings-sec)

&#x200B;

So, when you buy BABA, you aren't buying a direct interest in the company Alibaba itself, but instead you're buying a company registered in the Cayman Islands that was set up by Alibaba so that they could do an IPO to American investors.  The problem with this, is that you as an investor have no direct interest in the company, so you have no direct interest in  the cash flows of the business.  While this may sound like something that is not a big deal, it is a MASSIVE DEAL and is why I will never buy a Chinese company.  

&#x200B;

So to illustrate what can/will happen, we can go back to 2011, Yahoo owned about 40% of Alibaba before the American IPO, but it was via the same structure in Hong Kong, and Alibaba spun off one of its assets without notifying Yahoo or giving them an interest in it.  Yahoo sued Alibaba, and since Alibaba is a Chinese company, it went to a Chinese court where they essentially ruled that Yahoo did not own Alibaba, but they owned the VIE, and the VIE had no ownership of the part of the business that Alibaba was selling.  Alibaba settled with Yahoo in what was widely seen as a massive loss for Yahoo.  you can read the Reuters article here: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-alibaba/yahoo-gets-short-end-of-stick-in-alibaba-deal-idUSTRE76S2QN20110729/?edition-redirect=ca](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-alibaba/yahoo-gets-short-end-of-stick-in-alibaba-deal-idUSTRE76S2QN20110729/?edition-redirect=ca)

&#x200B;

You can still invest in Chinese cos and make money, but when I buy a company, I want to have a direct interest and ownership of the cashflows. You cannot have that with any Chinese company you are trying to buy.  I just wanted to say this as a word of caution to anyone looking to invest in China as this is something that should really be understood before investing in China.

Story by Kantaro Komiya

TOKYO (Reuters) -Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway raised its holdings in five Japanese trading houses, regulatory filings showed on Monday, in the U.S. conglomerate's latest investments in Japan's top commodity firms that began nearly five years ago.

Berkshire's stake in Mitsui & Co rose to 9.82% from 8.09%, while its holdings in Mitsubishi Corp, Sumitomo Corp, Itochu and Marubeni also rose by some percentage points, according to documents filed to Japan's securities watchdog by its unit, National Indemnity Company.

The filings followed Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire shareholders last month, where he said the five trading houses agreed to ""moderately relax"" limits that capped Berkshire's ownership stakes below 10%.

""Over time, you will likely see Berkshire's ownership of all five increase somewhat,"" Buffett had written.

Known as ""sogo shosha"", the trading houses deal in a variety of materials, products and food - often serving as intermediaries - and provide logistical support. They are also involved in the shipping, energy and metals businesses.

Here are links to the Japanese filings (***yes, they're in Japanese***).

1hf3d7p,2024-12-15,2024-12-15 16:50:58,Devil's advocate: Reddit stock is not a buy and is bad value today,"Everyone on this subreddit has been raving about Reddit stock and saying things such as ""It's good value."" I completely disagree and I want to share some of my input which may help people on this subreddit better understand where Reddit's valuation is today.

In simple terms, Reddit's valuation is very high. So, let's do back-of-the-napkin math where I assume an ultra-bull case. See below for my assumptions:

* Revenue grows 30% CAGR for the next 5 years. It reaches $4.75 billion in 2029. (Analysts expect 20-25% CAGR for next 5 years)
* Reddit has a profit margin of 30%. (This is an ultra-bull case - Meta has 34%, Google has 23%)
* In 2029, Reddit is a more mature company and trades at a valuation of 30 PE (Meta - 29 today, Google - 25 today)
* I completely ignore share dilution and taxes in this valuation just to make it more bullish. (This would drop valuation by about 20-30%)

So, assuming $4.75 billion with a 30% margin, gives a margin of $1.425 billion. If we multiply this by 30 times earnings, we get a $42 billion dollar valuation. Today, Reddit is valued at $30 billion. Assuming this unrealistic ultra-bull scenario is right, you would only achieve a 7% CAGR growth on your investment for a lot of risk.

So, how exactly is this a value investment? I wouldn't even consider it a good growth investment either.",305,305,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1hf3d7p/devils_advocate_reddit_stock_is_not_a_buy_and_is/,all,Stock Analysis,0.9

urx8ui,2022-05-17,2022-05-17 17:45:19,The sleight of hand that every investor should be aware of,"Modern accounting allows for a small trick that many companies take advantage of. As an investor, you should be wary of it.

The trick is to cleverly conceal stock-based compensation (SBC) within share repurchases.

Some investors look at the statement of cash flows and calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF) by taking the Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) and subtracting CapEx. Unfortunately, SBC is treated as a non-cash expense and added back to Net Income in computing CFO, which means that the FCF number calculated is likely inflated.

More astute investors realize that there’s no such thing as a free lunch. So, they treat SBC as a cash expense and ignore the line item that adds it back to Net Income in the statement of cash flows. While they are closer to the truth, they too are likely underestimating the impact of SBC.

Let me explain with the example of Apple. Here’s their [latest 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019321000105/aapl-20210925.htm).

If you look at their statement of cash flows, they have a SBC expense of [$7,906 million](https://imgur.com/a/Dtcf2ff) in the operating section.

So far so good. Now let’s take a look at the [financing section](https://imgur.com/a/ZR4IN6G) (all numbers are in millions):

* Proceeds from issuance of common stock = $1,105
* Payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards = ($6,556) \*
* Repurchases of common stock = ($85,971)
* Net cash flow related to common stock transactions = ($91,422)

*\* negative sign represents cash outflow*

 You can see the shares outstanding in the [balance sheet](https://imgur.com/a/uzvFqwb) (all numbers are in thousands):

* Shares outstanding at the end of fiscal 2021 = 16,426,786
* Shares outstanding at the end of fiscal 2020 = 16,976,763
* Net change in shares = 549,977

So Apple used $91.4 billion to repurchase 550 million shares. This works out to $166 per share. But AAPL shares never traded as high as $166 in fiscal 2021 (Oct-2020 to Sep-2021). Something’s fishy here.

Let’s look at the notes to the financial statements. Specifically [Note 8](https://imgur.com/a/Q6qxSri). There you go. The company repurchased not 550 but 656 million shares. But it also issued 106 million shares to employees.

So, of the $91 billion cash used in common stock transactions, only $76.6 billion (550/656 * 91) was truly used for repurchase. The other $14.8 billion was actually used for SBC (distributed as shares instead of dollars).

This means that the actual SBC of $14.8 billion is nearly double the reported figure of $7.9 billion!

Where does this $6.9 billion differential show up? Not on the balance sheet, the income statement, or the statement of cash flows. It shows up in the lower share count, or a lack of it. There’s your sleight of hand.

Here’s a [summarized view](https://imgur.com/a/Y8wL5le) of this gimmick. This isn't to pick on Apple. A lot of companies do this and it may be a natural consequence of the compensation policies. The lesson for us investors is that we should be skeptical of the reported SBC and repurchase numbers and adjust our cash flow expectations accordingly.

neqav6,2021-05-17,2021-05-17 16:03:45,How to hedge against inflation Michael Burry style," 

This is a portion of some of my recent inflation DD from researching Michael Burry/Scion's recent 13F plays. I thought it was an interesting investing strategy and wanted to share it here in case anyone is interested. There's more research over on [r/Burryology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/) (specifically [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/nepc7l/the_bull_is_gasping_major_themes_from_michael/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

***Inflation, inflation, inflation! (21%+ of current holdings)***

If you've been following [r/Burryology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/) since its inception many eons ago (a little over a month ago), you likely guessed that the next 13F would reveal Burry's strategy for hedging and/or profiting off of the inflation situation. Would he buy/hold REITs as the hedge? What about gold, oil, and other commodities? Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)?

We now have the answer.

Here are the direct inflation plays:

*Put options on* [***Ishares 20+ year treasury bond etf (TLT)***](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp) *-* *12.7% of current holdings*

*Probable Burry thesis:* rising inflation over the mid- to long-term will lead to the need to increase interest rates thus making these 20 year bonds less attractive.

*Some context:* The U.S. Treasury announced plans to start issuing 20-year treasury bonds in January 2020. The benefits to 20 year treasury bonds are that they're relatively safe, their value could increase if interest rates drop, and they're relatively liquid. The cons are that they're over a 20 year period (meaning you lock in very low interest rates at which you get paid), inflation may occur over that 20 year period and lead to an increase in interest rates that you'll miss out on, and rising interest rates in general hurt the value of these bonds ([link](https://www.mybanktracker.com/blog/investing/20-year-treasury-bonds-307834)).

*Call options on* [*Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treasury etf (TBT)*](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/TBT/profile) *- 4.1%*

Probable Burry thesis: this is the same 20+ year treasury bond mentioned above so the strategy is likely the same. The difference here is that it's a call on an inverse bond ETF.

*Context:* The ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index. (from Zacks article linked above).

*Put options on Ishares* [russell 2000 growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/russell2000.asp) *etf (IWO) - 3.1%*

*Probably Burry thesis:* There are two possibilities here. One is that the Russell 2000 is overpriced having outperformed the S&P 500 at 81% vs 43% since last May. The other is that inflation will lead to a recession that does actual damage to the economy which effectively makes a short on the Russell 2000 a bet against the overall economy.

*Context:* The Russell 2000 index measures the performance of the 2000 smaller companies that are included in the Russell 3000 index which itself is made up of nearly all U.S. stocks. It is seen as a bellwether of the American economy because it measures the performance of smaller businesses focused on the domestic market. It's considered more cyclical than the larger indexes which is to say that it follows the economy tightly.

*Others:*

1. *Shares of* *Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treasury etf (TBT) - 0.5%*
2. *Call options on Proshares ultrapro short 20 + year t (TTT)*

***Out with the REITs***

One of the more interesting observations from Scion's Q4 2020 13F was a sleuth of positions in various REITs. He had a little over 17% of the portfolio in REITs:

* Uniti Group Inc - 3.98% (now 0%)
* The GEO Group Inc - 3.51% (now 0%)
* RPT Realty - 4.05% (now 0.5%)
* Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc - 2.81% (now 0.1%)
* CoreCivic Inc - 3.07% (overall net increase in the total position, now 0.7%)

In Q1 2021, REITs accounted for just 1.3% of Scion's holdings. He exited out of Uniti and GEO, trimmed Urstadt and RPT Realty, and increased the CoreCivic position. All-in-all, it seems he's bearish on REITs serving as the best vehicle for profiting off of inflation compared to shorting the 20 year treasury bond.",310,88,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/neqav6/how_to_hedge_against_inflation_michael_burry_style/,all,Discussion,0.97

And this is puzzling. Mortgages are a commodity product. There’s no great tech or innovation to them. It’s a simple commodity which just competes on price.

In very recent history, bad practices in the mortgage industry lead to the 2007 financial crisis. They are supposedly much better regulated now.

So how does an industry like this create a 43 year old billionaire? On the face of it, it seems like there should simply be too much competition and regulation for that to happen.

Netflix Earnings Show That YouTube Is the Streamer to Fear



[https://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-earnings-alphabet-youtube-658104fa](https://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-earnings-alphabet-youtube-658104fa)



By Adam Levine

Over the past few years, Netflix has vanquished the likes of Walt Disney, [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com), and Apple in the battle to become the top videostreamer. Yet it’s slipping behind the company that has emerged as its biggest competitor: Alphabet’s YouTube.



This was hammered home on Thursday when Netflix reported second-quarter results. It earnings per share surged 47%. And according to Nielsen, its share of U.S. viewers remained at 8.3%—almost twice as high as all of the Disney channels combined.



The problem: YouTube’s share of U.S. viewers grew to 12.8% from 9.9% a year earlier. Whereas Netflix creates much of its own content and relies primarily on subscriptions, YouTube follows a different model that’s built on user-generated content and advertising.



Increasingly, Netflix is squaring off against YouTube while the rest of the streamers compete with one another.

The buffet indicator (public equity values over GDP) is well over 200%, which is currently uncharted territory. I’m sitting on way too much cash but with what I view at high valuations and a supporting indicator like this I have a hard time getting comfortable deploying it.

1legydd,2025-06-18,2025-06-18 09:21:03,"When insiders buy big after years of silence, I pay attention","One of the first things I check when analyzing a company is whether insiders own stock, and more importantly, if they’re buying more. It’s not just about ""aligning interests"", it’s about showing conviction. When someone from the inside puts real money on the line, especially during rough times, that speaks louder than any earnings call.

Recent example: Plug Power. After the stock tanked over 50% YTD, CFO Paul Middleton bought 650,000 shares at $1.03 in June 2025. Just weeks earlier, he had already grabbed 350,000 shares at $0.72. That’s over 900,000 shares bought on the open market in less than a month.

To be clear, this isn't a guarantee of anything. Insider buying is just one signal, and not a magical green light. But when someone with full access to the internals is betting big at these levels, I can't ignore it. At the very least, it makes me want to dig deeper and recheck the thesis.

Do you factor insider buying into your process? Ever had it lead you to a big win or a trap?

If you already have a well positioned portfolio that is reasonably diversified, investing a slight % into UNH is a no-brainer. Potentially strong upside and legislations that can shoot it right back up.

If you are currently suffering heavy losses and cannot afford to DCA (or double down, depending on how you want to phrase it), then I understand.

BUT, if you are looking for capital gains, a mainstay candidate to be at the forefront of your portfolio, it pains me how many people trying to stay away from an opportunity like these.

Time and time again contrarian views caution staying away and time and time again recovery always shows. Unless we're caught in the middle of a FNMA / Bear Stearns catastrophe from 2008... which if that is a concern you should not be holding any equities to begin with in this climate.

I bought the dump on COVID era crash, I bought the dump on SPY in 490s zone, it all worked out. Sure, past performances do not reflect future performances but what else have we got?

Now I'm not arguing for a full V shaped recovery all the way to the 500s and that you stay with this stock for years or even decades but 350-380 is definitely reasonable given the tenets of this subreddit.

1mft515,2025-08-02,2025-08-02 11:20:38,Is Novo Nordisk a Generational Buy?,"Not long ago Novo Nordisk ($NVO) was the king of the stock market, bigger than its own country thanks to Ozempic & Wegovy. The stock has been absolutely hammered after a >66% crash, and for good reason. 

Firstly, Eli Lilly ($LLY) is eating their lunch. Their rival drug, Zepbound, is clinically proven to be significantly more effective for weight loss.

Secondly they're fighting a guerrilla war with copycats: Unregulated ""compounding"" pharmacies are selling cheap, knockoff versions of the drug, hitting sales and brand integrity hard. 

Finally a crisis of confidence is taking place. Management slashed their financial outlook twice in three months and swapped CEOs, making them look like they've lost control. 

So, is it a falling knife to be avoided at all costs? I argue NO. The market has panicked, and the stock is now trading at a valuation not seen in decades, with a P/E ratio of around 13.This is a cash-printing machine with insane profit margins and a promising pipeline of next-gen drugs.

1g2i3g0,2024-10-13,2024-10-13 00:47:27,For those wondering if we're in a bull market.... ,"COST, a high volume retail store, trades at 50x forward earnings while CRWD, which literally brought the country to a halt a few months ago, trades at 75x forward earnings.  Both have PE/G ratios over 3 (1 is considered fair value).

The total market cap of the S&P is 2.0x US GDP (vs. historical norm: 0.75x-1x) while the P/E 10, i.e., Shiller's CAPE, is over 100% above its arithmetic mean and over 120% above its geometric mean.

While the US will continue to ""quiet"" default through non-stop printing, total government debt to US GDP recently surpassed 100%, which suggests it's only a matter of time before the bond markets start to push back with higher rates at the long end of the yield curve.

As they say, you can't call the waves but you can time the tides.

Is anyone adjusting their asset allocation, portfolio or going hmmm based on these metrics?

Note: if you disagree, please explain your valuation methodology and how you conclude a stock (or market) is fairly valued vs overvalued.  Just saying ""people have been saying the market is overvalued for years"" or ""a correction is coming"" doesn't really address my argument unless your opinion is valuation is no longer relevant because the Fed will just keep printing until kingdom come, which is probably true.

1mmistk,2025-08-10,2025-08-10 09:37:44,Why Apple is the world's most obvious Value Trap,"Everyone sees Apple as the ultimate safe stock, but my analysis shows it's a classic value trap waiting to spring. Its premium $3T valuation is dangerously disconnected from a new reality of stagnating growth, mounting threats, and a faltering innovation engine.

And before anyone says it's not a value trap, the term ‘value trap’ often conjures images of beaten-down, statistically cheap stocks that lure in value investors only to fall further. But the worst traps are not the ones that look cheap; they are the ones that still look magnificent. A true value trap is a company whose premium valuation is dangerously disconnected from a deteriorating reality. It persuades investors with the ghost of past glories, a powerful brand, and a reputation for invincibility that masks the grim reality of stagnating growth and mounting existential threats. Investors keep paying for a future that the fundamentals can no longer support.

Now here's why I think Apple is one:

Firstly, Apple is trading at a P/E ratio over 30, a price you'd pay for a high-growth innovator. But its revenue growth is projected to be a sluggish 4-6%.You can get double or triple that growth from Microsoft or Google for a similar or lower price. The numbers don't justify the premium. 

Next, the iPhone, which is over half their revenue, has hit a wall. Sales are flat or declining. Their once-unstoppable growth in China is now a major headache, where they're being forced into price wars with Huawei, sacrificing their legendary profit margins just to hold on to market share. 

Apple also isn't inventing the future anymore. They just cancelled their decade-long, multi-billion dollar car project. The Vision Pro, hyped as the next big thing, has been a commercial flop with demand cratering. And in the most important race of our time, AI, they are years behind competitors. 

Finally, the ""walled garden"" that generates their high-margin Services revenue is under a coordinated global attack. The US Department of Justice, the EU's Digital Markets Act, and new laws in Japan are all aimed at dismantling the App Store's monopoly power. The entire Services growth story is at risk.  

The market is still pricing Apple based on the company it *was*, not the company it *is*. The fundamentals are flashing red across the board, but investors are blinded by the brand. It's a textbook value trap, and a painful repricing feels inevitable.

1kfp0rn,2025-05-05,2025-05-05 18:33:00,Warren Buffett is not retiring for good as Berkshire board votes to keep him as chairman,"From CNBC:

>The Berkshire Hathaway board voted unanimously on Sunday to make Greg Abel president and CEO on Jan. 1, 2026, and for Warren Buffett, 94, to remain as chairman, the company said.

>Buffett shocked Berkshire shareholders and Abel by announcing in the final minutes of the company’s annual shareholder meeting Saturday that he would be asking the board to replace him as CEO at year-end with the current vice chairman of noninsurance operations for Berkshire.

>Buffett, who is both chairman and CEO, did not make it clear at the time whether this would mean he would relinquish the chairman title as well, although he did say he would be hanging around to help where he could. Buffett did make clear that the final word on company operations and capital deployment would be with Abel, 62, when this transition takes place.

>However, with Buffett staying as chairman, shareholders may be comforted that the “Oracle of Omaha” will remain to help Abel with any big acquisition opportunities that may arise in possible volatile markets ahead as the conglomerate Buffett took over in 1965 sits on more than $347 billion in cash.

>“I could be helpful, I believe, in that in certain respects, if we ran into periods of great opportunity or anything,” Buffett said on Saturday.

Buffett still retains a role at Berkshire.

Aided by one-time gains from investments and significant cost reductions, the company’s quarter marks a notable point in its ongoing transformation.

I don't think NVDA is properly priced right now, and that is not the point of this post.  The point of this post is to show how crazy this market has been with all of the uncertainty in the world (inflation, interest rates, multiple wars, trade wars, etc...)

My first few years I was just day trading, in and out of this stock and that listening to what anything on the internet was saying. I invested in two companies that were completely broke  and eventually went bankrupt losing entire investments. Then I started to listen to Warren buffet and the books he recommended and slowly got better but still loved to gamble in the “sure” things online.  Anyways the last couple years I have been killing the market.. a little under 40% CAGR. I think I’ve finally have a decent investing philosophy. This last month it all paid off as the stock I have been investing in for years went up a little over 40% giving me a $19,000 gain in a month. This was a weird feeling because it was awesome but it really didn’t feel like I was 19,000 richer. Just kind of seems out of touch. Has anyone else experienced this feeling after having their first great payout?

this could be big. glp-1 drugs are exploding in demand and costco might be trying to make them mainstream. feels like the same playbook as their cheap gas and rotisserie chicken — low margin, high traffic.

what i like is that pharmacy revenue is already growing ~15% y/y and this could add another membership hook. costco’s healthcare angle could increase renewal rates and average spend per member. not sure it moves eps much yet, but it strengthens the moat.

for novo nordisk, it’s another u.s. distribution channel before eli lilly’s zepbound ramps up. both stocks are expensive right now (costco ~45x earnings, novo ~40x), but this kind of real-world expansion gives them more durability long term.

1ny05x8,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 13:34:00,Why Pfizer is a massive buy,"Let's be honest, owning Pfizer for the last few years has been brutal. The stock's been hammered since the COVID highs, and the market is pricing it for dead. The story is that the sugar rush from the pandemic is over, and what's left is just a boring, slow-growth pharma giant facing a patent cliff.

But I think the market has this completely wrong. They're looking backwards at declining vaccine sales. When you look at what's actually happening under the surface, you see a company making some huge, smart moves for the future.

First, they just cut a landmark deal with the White House that takes a massive political risk (crippling tariffs, price controls) completely off the table. That alone is a game-changer. Second, they're using their COVID cash to build two new sources of growth. They spent $43 billion buying Seagen, a world leader in next-generation cancer drugs, and just made another multi-billion dollar purchase to get into the massive obesity market.

And the stock is dirt cheap. It's trading at a P/E ratio of around 14.5 while the S&P 500 is at nearly 24. On top of that, you get paid a 6.3% dividend yield just to wait for everyone else to catch on.

The market sees a value trap, but I see a de-risked, high-yield innovator at a cheap price.

UK's largest pet supplies retailer. Has its hands in every part of the lifetime of the pet. Toys, food, grooming, vet care, you name it all under the same roof. Loyalty program leads to stickiness in customers and its large presence and essential services creates a moat. Add to this that the pet industry is often considered recession-resistant I think this could be a good pick.

They are looking for a new CEO after the immediate departure of the old CEO after she issued a drop in previous profit guidance for the year, new one being 100 million pounds. Issue is that people in the UK are suffering from low salaries & inflation so the pet market is subdued. So the instability has put a lot of downward pressure on the stock.

So that is the risk. Value here is that they have consistently returned capital to shareholders, we have a 5.65% dividend yield at a PE of 12.6 + a very manageable debt (just 2x free cash flow). Good buyback program in place and they consistently reduce no. of total shares by 3-5% each year.

1nxsfij,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 08:17:16,Capital B is like btc in 2011,"Why Capital B deserves attention among Bitcoin equities

Capital B is quietly building what MicroStrategy made famous but doing it in a cleaner, more disciplined and fully European way.
Here’s what sets it apart. 

1. Pure Bitcoin exposure
Capital B’s balance sheet is made up entirely of Bitcoin - 100 %. No trading, no derivatives, no hedging.
The company doesn’t speculate, it accumulates. Its only goal: increase the number of sats per share over time. The purest publicly-listed Bitcoin play in Europe.

2. Regulated European structure
Listed on Euronext Paris, Capital B operates under full EU regulation (AMF, IFRS, AML). Institutional investors, funds and individuals can gain Bitcoin exposure without self-custody or U.S. regulatory risk. It bridges traditional equity markets and the Bitcoin economy.

3. Zero debt, zero leverage
Unlike MicroStrategy (levered with billions in convertibles), Capital B carries no debt at all. No margin calls No liquidation risk No dilution spiral. An unlevered treasury built to survive any bear market.

4. Value-accretive capital raises
When Capital B issues new shares, it does so at a premium to NAV. That means every raise increases the BTC per share ratio for all holders. It’s one of the few listed companies where new capital = higher intrinsic value.

5. Long-term investor base
Roughly 62 % of shares are held by long-term investors : founders, strategic funds (TOBAM, Fulgur Ventures), and early Bitcoin figures like Adam Back. This creates a natural volatility buffer: when weak hands sell, the core doesn’t.
Few Bitcoin equities have a shareholder base this stable.

6. Transparency & proof of holdings
Regular public updates include:
Bitcoin holdings
Average purchase price
Share count/NAV
Treasury changes

Anyone can verify the real BTC per share - a level of transparency most ETFs don’t offer.

7. Small-cap asymmetry
With a market cap near €100 – 150M (depending on BTC price), Capital B still has high convexity. A doubling of Bitcoin’s price could easily mean more than a doubling of the stock due to scarcity, liquidity, and sentiment effects. The early-stage version of what MicroStrategy became after its first BTC cycle.

Capital B = Europe’s clean Bitcoin treasury.
100 % Bitcoin exposure
0 % debt / 0 % derivatives
Regulated & transparent
62 % held by long-term investors
High convexity + low structural risk

It’s not a meme stock — it’s a disciplined Bitcoin treasury built for the next decade.

Super low P/E, growth story across 20+ platforms (48.2 % latest half), raised guidance, etc. At first glance, it screams “hidden gem.”

But the more I look, the more I feel like this could be a value trap — and I can’t quite put my finger on the exact reason.

A few things that stand out to me:

Revenue growth looks strong, but a lot of it is acquisition-driven. Yes, management says ~59% of growth was organic, which sounds good, but I still wonder how sustainable that is across so many different verticals.

They’re very acquisitive. Constantly buying new platforms in different industries. That creates complexity and execution risk, and makes it hard to judge whether the “core” business is actually stable.

The valuation is extremely cheap (like 3.2x free cash flow, do they have quite a bit of debt because of acquisitions,  ev to fcf is 5.2 ), and they still expect to grow 17 precent next year) That makes me think the market knows something I don’t. Sometimes cheap really does mean cheap for a reason.

My gut feeling: TPG might be a classic roll-up play where acquisitions boost the top line, but eventually integration, debt, or flatlining organic growth could catch up.

Does anyone here have a stronger view on this? Am I overthinking it and this is just a massively overlooked stock, or is there a hidden bear case (governance, leverage, industry cycles) that explains why it’s priced like this?

Curious to hear other opinions and maybe somebody found something i didn't.

Still in the process of learning how to analyse stocks. I finally took my courage in hand and opened for the first time a 10-k form. I opened Cadence Design, as I thought the business was interesting with a reasonably strong MOAT. 

What struck me is how analytical and research/statistic-oriented it is. Everything is very factual, number-driven. I guess it is normal for a SEC filling? I looked up the CEO, and he is an Electrical Engineer doctor (which seem to reflect well the tone of the paper I read).

Now comes my question. What are you trying to find out when reading a 10-k filling, especially when trying to figure out the overall business mind? Because I surprised myself wondering: Management and CEO obviously are top of their fields, but can it translate well in long-term business growth ? Numbers seem good too - is it the most important (only way) to look at it ?

1nxi60k,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 22:24:05,Question about portfolio protection. Options vs Stop Loss vs Gold/Bonds,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been investing for over 5 years, holding around 15–20 stocks plus 5 ETFs (100% equities), mostly U.S. and Canadian with a few Chinese tech names. My CAGR has been close to the U.S. index.

Lately, I’m getting concerned about market risk and realized I haven’t used any portfolio protection. I’m considering:

Stop-loss orders (15–20% for stocks, wider for ETFs/quality names).

Options (buying puts, though it seems like more work).

Diversification into gold or bonds.

What do you usually do to protect your portfolio? Any other suggestions?

1nx26pt,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 11:25:30,$BWB - Disciplined Regional Bank: The case for Bridgewater Bancshares,"Ticker: $BWB - Bridgewater Bancshares
Price(as of posting): $17.07
YTD: +28% (started ~13, has climbed as earnings and buybacks held up)


Why I’m watching-

Earnings: Q2 EPS beat ($0.37 vs $0.35 est). Net interest margin widened 11 bps QoQ. Nonperforming assets remain ~0.2% — very clean credit.

Book value: Tangible book per share is up to $14.21 as of June 30, 2025 (from $13.49 YE 2024).

Capital return: They’ve been buying stock.
2024: ~446k shares at $11.60 avg (~1.6% of float).

Q2 ’25: another 122k at $12.80 avg ($1.6M).
$13.1M remains under the plan, extended through Aug ’26.

Growth outlook: Management is guiding for mid–high single digit loan growth in 2025 and expects margin to hold or expand modestly if rates cooperate.

Valuation:
P/E ~14× (peers ~9–12×, higher-quality niche banks 12–13×).

P/B ~1.0–1.2× (tangible ~1.2×); sector avg ~1.1–1.2×, strong names 1.3–1.5×+.

So it’s near fair vs peers but with upside if ROE/margins hold.


Rate backdrop:

The Fed already cut 25 bps in Sept ’25. Loan yields will drift down, but BWB’s reported deposit costs have also started to fall (3.40% → 3.18% Q1 → 3.16% Q2). If deposit costs keep easing, margins can hold. If they stay sticky while loans reset lower, NIM compresses.

Minnesota macro tailwinds:

State finances are solid: Minnesota ended FY24 with revenues above forecast and continued job/wage growth.
The Minneapolis Fed’s Ninth District data shows a stable labor market and steady business activity, not booming, but resilient.

State development programs (like the Growth Loan Fund for small businesses) and healthy tax receipts help commercial lending demand.
Housing/new construction has cooled a bit with higher rates, but population and business activity keep the credit environment stable for a Twin Cities–focused lender.


What are the risks?

Deposit costs stay sticky as rates fall, squeezing margin.

Concentration: Top 10 borrowers ~18% of loans, top 10 depositors ~17% of deposits.

CRE exposure: Local commercial real estate weakness would hit harder than for diversified banks.
Capital/regulatory limits could slow buybacks.
Integration risk from the First Minnetonka City Bank acquisition.


So where could we be headed?

Base: $17.50–$20 if margins stay intact and loan growth materializes.

Bear: $12–$14 if deposit costs remain high or CRE credit cracks.

Bull: $22+ if ROE stays strong, FMCB integrates cleanly, and they keep buying stock near book.

A small but disciplined regional bank: clean credit, growing tangible book, active buybacks, fair valuation, and a stable Minnesota economy to lend into. The bet is steady ROE + capital return + possible re-rating. It’s not a moonshot, but a well-priced buy & hold.",0,0,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nx26pt/bwb_disciplined_regional_bank_the_case_for/,new,Stock Analysis,0.5

1nwuti4,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 05:54:07,Realistic 10-year S&P 500 Returns,"**Are 10% annual returns realistic for the next decade?**  
Most investors on the internet talks about the expected 10% annual return, based on historical returns.  
But is that true for the market today?

Historically the market is much cheaper than today, many investors seem not to care about valuations, and think AI will make explosive growth which will justify current valuations. However, we have a P/E over 31, and a Shiller P/E over 40, history tells us this won't end pretty.

Lets look at the numbers and model out the scenarios, to see what we can expect for returns.  
For this model we need a low, medium and high terminal P/E (what P/E will the S&P 500 end at in 10 years)  
and we need low, medium and high estimated earnings growth numbers.

Historically P/E has a median of 15, this is too low since it goes back to the 1800s, but in the past 50 years, the P/E median is \~20, in the past 20 and 10 years, it's \~25.

So let's go with:

* low: 20
* mid: 25
* high: 30

For growth estimations I looked at the past 20 years of earnings, 50% of the years were below or equal to 4% CAGR, which means this is most likely, and 20% of the years were above or equal to 8% CAGR.

To give some room for more expected growth, let's go with:

* low: 4%
* mid: 6.5%
* high 10% (only seen 4 times since 1880)

*(Note: these aren’t conservative.)*

We now can get the terminal value:

Terminal value = current EPS \* (expected growh rate)\^10 years  
current EPS = 219.52

From here we can see what Compounded Annual Growth Rate will get to the current share price from the terminal value in 10 years. For my estimations I get the following annual returns from the estimations:

* high: \~9% annual return
* mid: \~4.7% annual return
* low: \~1% annual return

1nwondf,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 23:37:11,Most Value Investors Under perform in the long run.,"Hey All,

I want to make it clear from the beginning, I am no one to criticize anyone else. I just want to express my humble opinion on value investing. Please take this in the best manner, i have no intention to come off as rude, arrogant or overall just a real annoying critique.

I think most people read graham or maybe the new value investors don't because of shortened attention spans. Look what worked for graham was only true because the markets were wholly inefficient and he just applied common sense, buffets early partnerships made some changes and showed signs of the shift to quality but mainly went of graham principles. Munger changes that of course, and today i believe that is really the right way to go. Most value investors statistically underperform; they just get caught up in the whole cheap thing, which is just outdated, and is a lot harder to make greater returns on. Spin offs special situations such things are not really my cup of tea, my thoughts on quant in value investing is that if dcf and the rest of qaunt analysis were so great, anyone with a computer and some algorithms would be making great returns. the former is of course not true.

What is true is finding high quality businesses with competitive advantages and barriers of entry that can be bought at a reasonable fair price. For this one must accumulate insanse amounts of knowledge to be ready when such a opportunity arises, they must research like Li Lu's famous timberland story, and 99% won't. I think that there is oppurtunity, just not for those looking for net - nets for the most part, its just a lot more difficult and the odds are not in your favour. The talks on microsoft and other big names are fine, but 20x earnings is not reasonable, and beyond tech stocks what are the real competitive advantages of LULU for example since thats trendy, i never see that. Maybe i am biased to Munger, but the numbers back him, the logic and common sense as well. 

Just my thoughts.

By Jordan Blum

Editor, Energy

October 2, 2025 at 3:30 PM EDT

The big move by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to buy the chemicals business of oil giant Occidental Petroleum for nearly $10 billion is a double win for Berkshire, analysts say, in Buffett’s potential swan song deal before retiring at the end of December.  The Oct. 2 deal is the first-ever Berkshire announcement that quotes incoming CEO Greg Abel and doesn’t mention the current chief executive by name.

The OxyChem business will operate as a strong stand-alone for Berkshire, while the deal should boost Berkshire’s nearly 30% ownership of parent Oxy because the Houston company will use the bulk of the proceeds to pay off the high debt load that’s dragged down its stock in recent years, said Doug Leggate, Wolfe Research energy analyst.

“It’s genius. It’s certainly a win-plus for Berkshire because it also helps the company that they own 30% of,” Leggate said. “It’s completely self-serving, it’s logical, and—not in any nefarious way—definitely helpful.”

The $9.7 billion, all-cash OxyChem deal is Berkshire’s largest since scooping up insurance player Alleghany in 2022. In recent years, Berkshire has focused on selling off stakes of its investments and is sitting on a whopping mound of almost $350 billion in cash.

Leggate called OxyChem a steady potential cash cow that focuses on its growing chlor-alkali business manufacturing PVC (polyvinyl chloride) resin for piping, construction materials, medical equipment, and more. Its business largely moves with the housing market, which could soon benefit more from falling interest rates. “It’s a low-volatile, uncontroversial, niche business that has pricing power given the market structure,” he said.

The 95-year-old Buffett announced his retirement plans in May, although Abel has long been tapped as his eventual successor.  Abel, the longtime Berkshire vice chairman of noninsurance operations, praised the OxyChem deal and Oxy CEO Vicki Hollub in the announcement.

“Berkshire is acquiring a robust portfolio of operating assets, supported by an accomplished team,” Abel said in the announcement. “We look forward to welcoming OxyChem as an operating subsidiary within Berkshire. We commend Vicki and the Occidental team for their commitment to Occidental’s long-term financial stability, as demonstrated by their plan to use proceeds to reinforce the company’s balance sheet.”

Berkshire did not immediately respond to interview requests.

Specifically, Oxy said, it will use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce debt and bring its principal debt below the $15 billion target it set following the late 2023 acquisition of Permian Basin oil producer CrownRock for $12 billion.  Hollub said the deal helps Oxy focus on its core oil and gas business, especially in the booming Permian, while strengthening its financial position through debt reduction.

OxyChem represents almost 20% of Oxy’s total pretax income, bringing in more than $1 billion annually.

**The Berkshire-Oxy courtship**

The intimate Berkshire-Oxy relationship dates back to 2019 when Oxy entered a dramatic bidding war with the much larger Chevron to acquire oil producer Anadarko Petroleum.  Anadarko had chosen to sell to Chevron when Oxy came back with a larger $38 billion offer that included much more cash—too good for Anadarko to turn down.

That offer only came to fruition when Hollub took a whirlwind trek to Omaha to see Warren Buffett and his Berkshire team. After a 90-minute meeting, Buffett committed $10 billion to finance the merger in exchange for preferred shares and a stake in the expanded Oxy.

The agreements allowed Oxy to boost its cash offer to about 80% of the purchase price in its successful David-versus-Goliath bidding war against Chevron.

Since then, Buffett has increased Berkshire’s stake in Oxy to more than 28%.

But in the meantime, the big acquisitions left Oxy with a much greater debt load, especially going into the pandemic in 2020. Oxy barely survived the downturn, slashing its dividend from 79 cents per share each quarter down to just one penny. Since then, the dividend has risen back up to 24 cents—still much lower than in 2019.

The OxyChem deal largely solves the debt problem, although Oxy won’t begin redeeming Berkshire’s preferred shares—and their 8% annual interest—until 2029.

“In a world where crude \[pricing\] is softening, Oxy has too much debt. It’s unequivocal that it’s a good thing for Oxy to raise cash and pay down debt,” said Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Pickering Energy Partners consulting and research firm.

While Abel may already be in the dealmaking driver’s seat for Berkshire, Pickering said, “\[Buffett\] was the driver of the original Oxy investment, so I’m sure he was involved.”

Pickering compared Berkshire’s likely double win for both OxyChem and Oxy to a “circular loop” like the booming AI sector’s recent investments in one another’s companies: “AI is in a circular loop where Nvidia gives money to somebody, who gives money to somebody, who gives it back to Nvidia.”

The only problem for Oxy on Oct. 2, though, was its stock surprisingly fell by 7%. Oxy had outperformed the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF by about 2.5% this week through Oct. 1, largely baking in the deal before the Oct. 2 announcement.

Oxy is selling its chemicals business at a bit of a discount when the broader petrochemical sector is near a cyclical trough.

Pickering said there was some “sell the news dynamic” at play. But the sale also diminishes some hopes that Berkshire would buy Oxy in its entirety, potentially hurting the stock.

“By buying these pieces, the odds that he’s going to buy it all have gone down,” Pickering said.

A year ago, this reporter asked Hollub at what point Berkshire might control too much Oxy stock. Her response: “We would never consider it to be too much.”",209,18,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwinqk/warren_buffetts_berkshire_hathaway_may_have/,new,Buffett,0.96

What most fail to realize stuck in this trap is that they're likely going to underperform the index with a high degree of certainty - Which begs the question why are you working so hard to lock in mediocrity?

Understand that benchmark 10% returns P/A should be your discount rate and what you apply to your stock valuation calculations - not a 10/20 Year treasury - This achieves 2 things: You start looking for companies growing higher than the index and you naturally will be purchasing them at a lower price because of a higher discount rate.

Dividend investing is dead and likely to become worse - People thinking about cash flow when their purchasing power is declining not to mention the risk of the stock going down below your purchase price and yielding less % on your $ invested - You're better off owning real estate and getting rental income with some capital appreciation - and if you can't afford Real estate why bother chasing cash flow on peanuts lol - you're essentially falling behind even faster - the other option would be a term deposit if you're at a stage in life where preservation is more important than growth and the yield on cost is higher than real estate rental income.

If you're not prepared to gamble in markets somewhat for out performance you may as well call it a day and just own the index and accept your fate.

Holding cash if you don't have great entries on stuff now makes some sense because it allows you the opportunity to buy bargains when markets shit the bed/good companies fall out of favor. (you will naturally be doing this while using a 10% discount rate) and have a list of companies you want to own.

I think this is one of those opportunities I found pretty recently.

**Steep Hill Inc.** (formerly known as Canbud Distribution Corporation) was incorporated to provide hemp-based science-backed products and services. It started the wind-down and stopped operations at the end of 2022. The business has been trying to acquire other businesses to continue operations, unsuccessfully. This seems to be their current strategy, to find and acquire another business. The businesses' filings doesn't give the updated balance sheet report, but I found the updated working capital in the foot notes. based on the 2024 filing, I can see they have no long term liabilities, so this working capital number I found is the up to date liquidation value of the business.

**These figures are in (CAD)**

* $56,000 in cash
* $2,000,000 in deposits
* $106,000 in liabilities
* NCAV(liquidation value): $1,950,000
* Market Cap: $1,050,000
* Share Price: $0.065
* Under Valued: by 46%

**Risks**

Possible current share dilution authorized for the management is 8%.

The real risk of this shell style business is slow burn of cash over time. If we estimate a 300k burn a year, this business is still at a liquidation value of 1.35M in 2 years, at which point I'd sell it if the management didn't make any meaningful change.

**Predicted Outcome**

The most likely outcome is a slow burn of cash over a year, then the business acquires another business and improves/continues operation. In this case, the business will be 36% under valued when it unlocks value for the shareholders, which would be a 57% return.

The next most likely is that they have a merger/acquisition sale to another business, or liquidate their business.

* If they do it immediately, the return is an 86% return.
* If they wait a year before doing this, it will be a 57% return.
* If they wait 2 years before doing this, it will be a 29% return.

My position size is 5.5% of my capital, and I plan on holding onto this stock for 2-3 years, or until the market cap gets close to the NCAV(liquidation value).",4,17,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwh991/little_ben_graham_cigarbutt_if_youd_like_a_puff/,new,Stock Analysis,0.83
1nwg9lu,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 17:14:08,Securities analysis is a deluded fallacy. ( Under the current monetary regime.),"
Don’t shoot me, I’m just a messenger.

However, my assertion is quite straightforward:

Under our current monetary system, which relies heavily on hyper-stimulated credit injections into the economy, securities analysis and business valuation have become almost irrelevant. This is due to the unreliable nature of economic calculations caused by central banking monetary policies.

The financial economy serves as the primary conduit for central banking policies. Financial assets experience an initial surge in value before the underlying economy has fully assessed the viability of capital investments. This disconnection fuels the boom, leading to further capital misallocation into speculative ventures with minimal real demand or profit potential.

Essentially, stocks rise and continue to rise due to the influence of the Federal Reserve. Wall Street exacerbates this situation through its marketing and pressure-selling tactics. After all, Wall Street’s primary revenue streams are securitization and trading. As the boom continues to grow and persist, Wall Street’s wealth increases accordingly.

Therefore, professional investors, most hedge fund managers, financial gurus, social media promoters, and most “professionals” in finance are essentially opportunistic beneficiaries of easy money and loosened credit injections into the financial markets.

For instance, consider Warren Buffett’s case. In 1980, he was worth $500 million and was already one of the wealthiest individuals in the world. Back then, there were only 13 billionaires worldwide. Fast forward 40 years, and Warren Buffett’s net worth has skyrocketed to $150 billion, while the global number of billionaires has increased to 3,000. Simultaneously, the value of the dollar has declined by nearly 74% in the same period. This means that while savers have been impoverished, asset holders have experienced significant wealth effect.

And you wonder why you can’t afford a home Millennial!!! (lol)

The value of Buffett’s wealth is not solely attributed to his exceptional stock-picking abilities but rather to his long-term investments in high-quality financial assets added and abetted by inflation.


All these financial metrics and accounting calculations are meaningless in an inflationary environment. However, accountants, CPAs, CFAs, academics, MBAs, and other investment experts need to earn a living, so they market their systems, books, newsletters, and other products to the public.

Essentially, the entire investment industry is somewhat  a pyramid scheme built on easy money. The moment the Federal Reserve reduces its money supply, the entire system collapses quickly.

Fortunately for the Wall Street professionals and gamblers , the current neo-Keynesian academics at the helm of the Federal Reserve have no intention of ever cutting off the flow of money and credit. Therefore, the boom may continue and spread to other tokenized vehicles and investment schemes.

The good news is that you can simply buy and hold great businesses and forget about it. Cash is toxic!

By the way,

Ben Graham operated under a more sound financial system, similar to Natural Finance under the Gold Standard. Since 1971, the world has entered an era of inflation and a fiat financial system. Securities analysis and economic calculation cannot be conducted in the same way in both regimes.

It’s literally at all time low this year (-68%) after this news. I understand this company has been struggling since the tarrif threats but now we finally have good news of investing this company. So why plummet more?  

A bit of background of the stock leading up to recent lows

Algoma Steel (ASTL) trades at ~$3.20 USD with recent weakness tied to soft steel pricing and tariff pressures. Q2 results showed declining revenue, negative EBITDA margins, and a net loss, with shipments around 472K tons. Balance sheet stress remains as liabilities outweigh assets, though government support has been secured. Transition to electric arc furnace (EAF) technology is underway, with first-steel production achieved, positioning for cost efficiencies and lower emissions. Near-term challenges include margin compression and high input costs, but long-term prospects hinge on EAF ramp-up, policy support, and global steel demand recovery.

1nwa6yo,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 13:29:43,FactSet - If you missed out on Google,"I'm writing to inform you that FactSet, a financial data company with a strong competitive advantage is trading at fair value.

  
My brief thesis:

* FactSet has a strong moat. The company serves institutional investors: hedge funds, asset management companies, buy-side shops, pension shops, etc... The customers either buy a FactSet terminal, or SaaS subscription.
* The customer retention rate is above 90%.
* Manageable debt.
* Strong track record of earnings growth.
* Trading at PE of 18.5 (reasonable compared to its historical average of above 25.
* Revenue is still growing at a steady pace.
* Risks: Primary risk is that the tool could be replaced by other AI saas products. Which is a fair fear to have, however they are so deeply integrated with customers that it will be hard to rip off FactSet and replace them with a new startup. FactSet has tons of historical data and expertise in financial data market, I would expect the management to innovate to fend off competitors. 
* I would like to call out that FactSet by no means is offering margin of safety like my previous investments in baba, meta, bti, and others. However it is currently trading at a fair value.
* A very general example to understand FactSet: An analyst would pull the data either through api, or dashboard, transform the data with other third party and first party data to create dashboard/reports for management.

What do you guys think? Are there others risks that FactSet is facing, and what do you think is FactSet's fair value?",36,56,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwa6yo/factset_if_you_missed_out_on_google/,new,Discussion,0.81

1nw8hdx,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 12:26:18,Expanding Recycling Capacities at Campine nv - Global ship lease as a dividend payer?,"My favorite circular economy company is Campine nv - a belgian recycling company.  
China banned antimony export last year. since then recycling became even more attractive. they have smelter capacities, they recycle lead acid batteries, PET, Antimony, etc.  
they are the biggest producer of antimony trioxide outside of china and their share of the worlds antimony trade is over 10%.  
good amount of growth (H1 2025 had over 380 million€ in revenues) and over 24€ in EPS, which is already more than their entire record year 2024! their P/E is around 6 (if we assume that EPS for the second half will be around 11€ -which is a very conservative estimate imo) so we are assuming 35€ in EPS for the year 2025.  
this will be achieved without the acquisition which was approved yesterday. this acquisition will add another 100 million€ to yearly revenues (and cashflow-positive already - which will be even enhanced by synergy-effects, since at some place they have a surplus of metals and they will add smelting capacities..) they export into the US, Japan, India, europe and many more!  
the CEO is very conservative with predictions (you can read the last press releases) and management delivered very well over the past years.  
dividend is usually 1/3 of the Earnings so at 35€ (conservativly speaking) it will be a dividend of around 12€ so \~6% in dividends (200€ share price) .  
the interessting thing is, that the export ban of china got them a lot of new costumers in japan, india, the US etc and likely these relationships may last since campine is also consulting their costumers, since they have a big expertise (100 year company history).  
their recycling percentage will like rise (i think it was 30 or 50%) so they will hve even cheaper antimony which will enahnce margins. the downside may be, that antimony trioxide is being substituted as a flame retardand because of high prices, but in the PET production process the substitution is much less likely in the near term.  
P/S is 0.5-0.6

The press release from yesterday: [https://www.campine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251001ecoeng.pdf](https://www.campine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251001ecoeng.pdf)

Another Company that looks interessting may be global ship lease:   
they have small container ships which is a big plus imo, because climate change will have rivers at low water levels, which will enable them to manouver through low water the longest. They constantly improved their fundamentals since the new ceo took office a few years ago (less debt and higher equity etc) their P/E is around 3 and they pay over 6% in dividends. their contracts are on average over 2 years which means that they will almost earn the entire money for which the company trades at the moment (P/E 3 and over 2 years of guaranteed contracts/income streams). 

Management seems to do good work at both of the companies and climate change might boost the economical outlook for both.

1nw6ogr,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 11:19:28,Albertsons ACI - Undervalued Supermarket Chain,"Boring company but I think its a cheap defensive play especially if you think the market is expensive.

Albertsons is currently at $17.35 its valued less than 11X 2024 earnings and has an EV / Sales of 0.2. Kroger was going to pay roughly $27 a share to buy ACI but it ultimately fell through for antitrust reasons. Kroger has a PE of 17 and EV / Sales of 0.4. Weis has a PE of 17 and EV / Sales of 0.3. 

Kroger will likely have to pay Albertsons a break up fee of $600 million or roughly 6% of the stock price. Albertsons also has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $2 billion so roughly 20% of the stock. During the latest quarter they bought 14.2 million shares at $22 for a total of $314.8 million. They are likely buying even more at these decreased prices. 

2024 had lower earnings of $1.64 as compared to $2.23 in 2023 but part of that was one time expenses like those related to the expenses of a failed merger. Even if the earnings stay at the $1.64 range, which with less shares is unlikely, than the **fair price for this is around $28 - $30** with a PE of 17 or EV / Sales of 0.3 based on their peers. **So more than 60% from here**. 

Potential other upsides you could get an extra $1 from Kroger paying up the $600 million, the share count be decreased even more significantly thus increasing the earnings per share, earnings could go up now that the merger costs are behind them, and Goldman listed them as one of their top 48 potential M&A candidates with a 15% to 30% probability.

1nw21pg,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 08:12:12,Rubrik (RBRK): The Next Big Thing in Cyber AI,"Rubrik (RBRK) is a high-growth, high-upside play on cyber AI.

The company provides data security and backup software that protects and restores critical business information. Its platform takes frequent, immutable snapshots of data so organizations can recover quickly from cyberattacks or outages. Think of it as a safety net across on-prem, cloud, and SaaS environments. Rubrik also organizes metadata about what data exists, where it lives, and who accessed it — helping customers comply with regulations and insurance requirements. The business model blends subscriptions and support, with a growing emphasis on software and cloud services.

AI expands the attack surface by spreading data across vector databases, SaaS tools, and model-training pipelines. Rubrik’s edge is not just preventing damage but enabling fast recovery when things break. As more teams deploy AI agents and new data stores, backups must be frequent, tamper-resistant, and easy to restore. Rubrik’s automation and policy-driven controls standardize resilience across hybrid IT. Its platform can also surface unusual activity and guide remediation, reducing costly downtime. In an era of strict regulation and board-level cyber scrutiny, data resilience becomes essential infrastructure for AI adoption.

Rubrik has built a data graph—rich metadata on backups, versions, and relationships—that improves visibility and accelerates recovery. Immutable backups raise the bar against ransomware, a top risk for AI-heavy organizations. Deep integrations with major clouds, enterprise apps, and security platforms create stickiness and reduce complexity. Over time, telemetry from thousands of environments becomes a learning advantage for detection and response. Compliance mandates make consistent backup and recovery a requirement, not an option—supporting Rubrik’s durability at the recovery layer, where budgets remain resilient even in downturns.

As AI accelerates data creation, enterprises will spend more to protect it, favoring platforms that collapse multiple tools into one workflow. Rubrik can expand wallet share by covering more workloads and increasing backup frequency within its customer base. AI-first startups and modernized IT estates create new growth avenues. A shift toward software- and cloud-delivered services should lift margins, while cross-selling security analytics on top of backup deepens engagement. With cyberattacks frequently in the headlines, recovery-focused platforms stand to benefit from urgency and board-level attention. We see Rubrik as a ~25% revenue grower with potential for >50% compounded EBITDA growth as margins expand.

Over the next year, watch for large enterprise wins, public-sector contracts, and deeper partnerships with major cloud providers. Product launches that extend coverage to AI data stores or improve automated recovery would be notable. Tighter cyber-insurance standards could indirectly boost adoption. Migration tools for legacy backup replacements may accelerate competitive takeaways, while alliances with incident-response firms or SIEM/SOAR vendors would broaden reach. ARR growth and improving retention will be key signals for the long-term thesis",11,6,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nw21pg/rubrik_rbrk_the_next_big_thing_in_cyber_ai/,new,Stock Analysis,0.79

1nvuluv,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 00:49:36,AMZN is cheaper than you think,"So I'm sure many people are looking at AMZN's P/E ratio of 33.7x and thinking that while it's more reasonable than it used to be, it's still pretty expensive. Especially when you can pickup shares of GOOGL or META at 26x. But I think a useful valuation metric to look at is the price to operating cash flow and I'll explain why.

Net income is an accounting metric that includes depreciation and amortization, and it's up to the business to decide the schedule for those, meaning they can decide, for example, that the useful life of a GPU is 6 years when in reality it's probably 2 years. Another problem is that GAAP requires companies to mark to market any investments each quarter, meaning that if a company holds shares of a different company, the change in price effects net income.

This is why investors run discounted cash flow models, because ultimately cash is what matters--not accounting results. The value of a business is the present value of the future cash you can extract from the business over its life. The problem with using free cash flow is that capex is part of the equation, and capex is highly variable year to year. Some years you may buy a new office building and a new warehouse and a bunch of warehouse equipment, and other years you might not buy anything.

Operating cash flow removes capex from the equation which allows you to simply focus on how much cash the business actually produces from its operations. Not paper gains of a stock they hold, or because they chose to extend the useful life of their assets. Just the operations.

So on a price to trailing twelve month P/OCF ratio, here are the results for the Magnificent 7 stocks:

* TSLA: 91.3x
* NVDA: 59.0x
* AAPL: 34.9x
* MSFT: 28.3x
* GOOGL: 22.1x
* AMZN: 19.4x
* META: 17.6x

Now you might think this is stupid because free cash flows are what matter. Who cares if your operating cash flow is great but you need to spend it all on capex to continue generating the cash flow? While this is true, I think it's useful to compare just the operating businesses as capex is highly variable and is a choice that doesn't need to be made in perpetuity. Now of course, AMZN is by far the most structurally capital intensive (besides TSLA? maybe?) since they actually move real stuff in the real world so that needs to be taken into consideration. 

Anyway, just thought I'd share. I think understanding the price you're paying relative to the cash generated by operations is useful and should be considered when evaluating a business' valuation.

I particularly like a couple of industries. One is Pharma. I like it because the barrier to entry is high. I understand it decently, and more importantly, I know people within this industry, several of whom operate their own pharmacies. So i like to screen within industries i like, with p/b ratios under 1.5 and p/e that is trailing compared to industry, another is NAV exceeds market price, and EPV exceeds market cap, these are rough numbers i am to do a more deep quantitative analysis after.

I know they’re not exactly a typical “deep value” stock, but they’ve got some interesting qualities:

* Market cap around \~$50B
* Net cash balance sheet (basically no debt, lots of cash reserves)
* Strong brand/IP portfolio (Mario, Zelda, Pokémon, etc.) that seems evergreen
* Switch 2
* Trades at a relatively modest P/E compared to other gaming/entertainment giants
* Dividend yield \~2–3%, with buybacks here and there

Feels like a weird mix of being a consumer brand, a hardware company, and an IP licensing play.

1nvlhpb,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 17:42:51,"Most people are better off being ""growth"" investors (including this sub)","I'm not sure if this will be insightful or dumb, but this is Reddit so there's no reason to concern myself with that... 

I think most individual investors that feel the need to buy single stocks are probably better off being what most here would describe as ""growth"" investors. (I don't agree with growth vs. value being a binary split, because growth is obviously a component of value). The market today isn't filled with net-nets (there are some), cigar butts, and stocks that trade at a discount to book or replacement/sale value. Those that do are often hard to find, messy and difficult to analyze. So you need to have a view on the future and growth prospects (it's not just pure speculation as Graham said so I don't wanna hear that).

I think most stock pickers are better off focusing on strong businesses that are growing and having more flexibility on P/E ratios rather than trying to find ""value"" based on stocks that have tanked recently. A large portion of this sub loves low P/E stocks or those down 30+% and overlook fundamental challenges simply because the stock went down and now it appears ""value."" You can put whatever stock du jour is the most talked about in this sub in that category most of the time... occasionally popular stocks here bounce back strongly, but I'm inclined to believe that may be more luck than skill... unless someone has a mention tracker going for testing... 

Those same folks look down on all the higher multiple stocks that the market loves that are strong and growing businesses. **I am not talking about the highest multiple or meme/hype stocks**, just quality businesses that people know and are most likely going to experience future success but trade at multiples around the broader market or \~25% premiums. There are so many commenters here that overlook quality and hate a company that's trading at or near all time highs and think they're smarter than the market. They also think they're smarter than the market after a recent drop and think that recent ""cheapness"" equates to value. **You hate that people buy stocks just because they went up, but do the exact same thing and buy stocks just because they went down**. Momentum is a powerful force especially with trading volumes mostly driven by passive and levered pod shops. You're fighting against that when you buy a recently tanked stocks, at least those picking ""obvious"" businesses have those as tailwinds. 

I think most people would be better off investing in ""obvious"" strong, growing companies even if everyone else loves them rather than focusing all their attention on things that have fallen and probably subjecting yourself to a lot of value traps. Great businesses have a tendency to surprise on the upside and their execution and I believe those going through issues and turnarounds have a tendency to surprise on the downside. This entire spiel I doubt many will read **does not apply to anyone who will take the time to deeply understand a business, it's economics, strength, and potential for the future** I just don't see a lot of that here (to be clear **I'm not claiming to have that ability either**...). 

If you want to buy some single stocks, but aren't going to make a career out of it the ""obvious"" ones might be your friend. I'd rather be consensus and right than contrarian and wrong... buy stocks because the business is strong and it's a reasonable price, don't fall in love with only a lower price. If you're absolutely must call yourself a value investor so you can look down on others without actually putting in the work just buy Berkshire Hathaway and call it a day...

Then considering the dilution from the 560 million in convertible notes at $55 (that’s your 12.5 percent). 

… basically, I bought a couple $55 January 2027 leaps that should let me ride it up over the next six months and cash out while (theoretically) we get another rate reduction or two, their expansion into the HELOC market continues, and people start to see ai underwriting actually does a better job at avoiding delinquency than the straight FICO system we use today. 

My really dumbed down thesis:

People are still afraid of ai underwriting when they shouldn’t be, and as their revenue CAGR continues to accelerate that fear will diminish. 

Upcoming rate cuts (including the recent rate cut) will provide fuel for their fire. 

Market expansion will continue, global expansion is inevitable. 


Edit: I should add the conversion notes @ about 35 bucks for around 600 million, so the total dilution is around thirty percent but that $80 per share forecast includes it.

1nvc4nn,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 11:58:03,JD Stock Forecast,"Hey everyone I have had some pretty solid calls this year on foreign equities, including BABA at $114 and JMIA at $2.40. I am back with another call and DD report on JD. 

Chinese equities have been abandoned by global investors, and JD.com is one of the clearest examples. The stock fell from over $100 in 2021 to below $30 in 2023 despite remaining profitable and holding one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector.

Today JD is valued at less than 10x earnings, 0.3x sales, and just above book value. It sits on more than $27 billion in cash and is using buybacks to reduce its float. This is an e-commerce and logistics leader trading at distressed multiples, while peers like Amazon (33x PE) and Alibaba (21x PE) command far higher valuations.

The recovery in 2025 is starting to take shape for China. Alibaba has already surged more than 70 percent this year as sentiment improves. JD has lagged, but volumes are rising, short interest is falling, and the stock recently broke resistance levels (200d SMA). The fundamentals point to double digit revenue growth, expanding profitability, and a long runway in AI, robotics, and fintech.

For my modeling into 2030, I assumed the following:

* **Revenue Growth Assumptions:** Modeled CAGR between 10–20% depending on macro conditions and market share trends.
* **Margin Expansion:** Forecasts net margins improving to 4–5% through cost efficiencies, logistics scaling, and AI-driven operations.
* **Buybacks:** $27B in cash could allow repurchase of 15–20% of shares by 2030, lifting EPS by 20–25%.
* **Peer Multiples:** Valuation targets based on Alibaba (\~21x P/E) and Amazon (30–40x P/E) suggest significant re-rating potential.
* **Scenario Analysis:**
   * Bear: $80 by 2030 (10% CAGR, 15x P/E).
   * Base: $140 by 2030 (15% CAGR, 20x P/E).
   * Bull: $200+ by 2030 (20% CAGR, 25x P/E, upside from AI/health/fintech).
* **Optionality:** Strategic investments in healthcare, fintech, and robotics are not fully priced in, so upside could exceed modeled cases.

This is not financial advice, but the setup resembles other moments of extreme mispricing that I have seen reverse sharply once capital flows return. JD’s logistics moat, authenticity focus, and cash reserves give it staying power in a very competitive market. 

Just because Chinese equities were punished for years, does not mean they always will be. Institutions can only ignore cash flows and valuations such as these for so long, particularly as US markets approach extreme overbought levels. 

For a less fundamental approach, JD historically lags than catches big moves from BABA. I see that happening here, and rather quickly as rally begins to broaden out. ",30,43,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://northwiseproject.com/jd-stock-forecast-2030/,new,Stock Analysis,0.87

1nvaaws,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 10:50:32,how do you value a company that is trying to gain market share at the expense of near-term losses,"What I mean by this is that consider you were to come across Amazon or Shopify when they were still young public companies. Now if management really wanted to, they could show investors a healthy net income with good profit margins. Instead, however, they chose to market aggressively...diluting shares, over-hiring, fighting tooth and nail to establish their footprint.

By all means if you could identify this early, you would be very rich today. And this is more than just looking at accounting statements because they don't tell the whole story. Some might say look at operating cash flow but companies might hire so aggressively and pay for top talent that it could easily be negative too.

Valuation might be complicated I know, but how does one even identify whether this is a good company to invest in and that they aren't just wasting money. For example, the traditional value investor could easily say, Amazon in 2010 has absolutely zero moat and that they are burning cash to give people cheaper items and faster delivery and they would eventually find competitors and the pricing wars would make everyone a loser (except the customer). My point is that it is simply not very easy when companies are in this phase to identify good from bad. So how do you approach this?

Robust growth, average in the past 5 years is above 30%, both for revenue and income. 

Incredible profitability:
Operating margin - 65.5%
ROE - 67%
ROIC - 65.8%

They enjoy near monopoly in Kazakhstan with 15 million active users with 75 transactions per month (so almost all of the adult population of Kazakhstan)

One of their new tangets of growth, E-Grocery in the latest quarter, grew 57% YoY. Oh, and one of the founders is the owner of the biggest grocery store network in the country. 

They are aggressively expanding into new region, purchasing bank and market place in 100M population Turkey. And judging by H2 report from hepsiburada a turn around story is already in play.

High insider holding about 43%. Very shareholder friendly.

Surely this company should be trading at hefty valuation. Nope. Not even fairly valued. It's trading at PE of 7.19 and PEG of 0.39.

The fundamentals are strong, and IMO it's fairly priced compared with competitors in appareal retail industry. i'm genuinely curious about the low number of mentions the company has in this sub. 

A couple of important points on why I consider this a value investing play:

1. Aspirational brand but still affordable for common people, unlike luxury companies like LVMH, Hermes, and so on.

2. Healthy balance sheet and strong cash generation (highly important)

2. P/E \~25, which is reasonable for appareal industry

3. They have consistently beaten analysts’ expectations since 2021

4. they have instituted sizeable share repurchase programs

Of course, there are risks related to the fashion industry itself (NKE, LULU, etc.), but this one in particular have had a really strong performance over time. In fact, for me, it has been kind of a safe-haven asset, very resistant to tariffs and the recent economy downturns.

I feel I rarely see Berkshire's investments in the Japanese Trading Houses talked about here.

Berkshire has a massive advantage in that they're borrowing at a super low rate. And dividend yields are in the range of 4%-7% at the moment. Which not a lot of us have a chance for this arbitrage.

Given this, are they still value buys, in that we can expect prices to continue to increase?

1nv69x4,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 08:02:04,Changes to the investment strategy as the interest rates decline,"

With the interest rate approaching 4.0% and especially once it falls below 4.0% I do not consider interest rates high anymore. Therefore I have to do adjustments to my current primary strategy described almost a year ago. The main idea of the original strategy was to keep most of the money in t-bills that reliably yield close to 5% and exploit the rest of the money as a tool to frequently buy and sell(cycle) dividend paying high quality stocks. The strategy allowed earning around 10% annually with almost no risk. As yields on cash fall below 4% this strategy loses its appeal and I have to do the adjustments.

Before I explain the changes let me tell you one envious thought I had for many years… Take a look at 10yr treasury yield historic chart...

Think of a guy in the 1980s who bought 10yr or especially 30yr treasury… The guy would enjoy 15% risk free return all the way until the 2010s… The world economy grew fast in the 1980s but the modern world doesn’t grow as fast mostly because of saturation and low human breeding rates. What if 5% return is equivalent to 15% in the 1980s given the low growth of the world?

The first changes to the strategy came in May and were explained in my previous blog posts. I indeed significantly increased exposure to high quality US stocks leaving me exposed to higher risk but it also provided a better than expected returns during this period. As time goes by I now face the dilemma of still incredibly rich valuations of stocks and therefore high risks of drawdowns yet I cannot keep a significant portion of portfolio in t-bills as they provide unattractive returns. Therefore about a month ago I started the transition of t-bills based strategy to bond based strategy. I do not hold any t-bills anymore and now the money is either in stocks or bonds… This significantly increased my risk exposure but bonds will provide a much higher yield of around 6% while still being a relatively low risk instrument. The main reason why I think bonds are ok now is that I do not expect significantly higher inflation as the transition of the new administration tariffs as well as certain reduction in government expenses in certain areas show signs of fiscal responsibility and hopefully the inflation will be tamed.

The stocks strategy also changed slightly. I do not cycle dividend stocks as much as I used to and keep stock ownership much longer as well as increased exposure to some high quality stocks with lower dividend yields. I continue to buy and sell the same stocks though. So some cycling is still happening but less of it. So here it is. This is what I am doing now for the next 3-6 months. Then we will review again.

1nuy1s9,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 23:46:52,How Dating and Investing Are Similar-,"When a person is in their youth, let’s call it from sixteen to thirty years old, finding a life partner is of interest, if not a high priority, for many people. There are societies where cultural norms dictate the available universe of potential mates. The approach one takes in finding a potential mate is as diverse as there are humans. Some might place a high priority on physical appearance. Others might place a heavier weighting on friendship and compatibility. Let’s consider two approaches. The first person is a social butterfly who is active in the bar scene. Each weekend, they go with their friends to a local club to have a good time and enjoy the allure of finding their one-in-a-million dreamboat. On occasion, they might drink a few too many beverages and engage in extracurricular activities where they wind up in situations where they don’t quite remember, or are comfortable with, the person they are now faced with, or, um, ahem, even closer.

The second person approaches their social activities differently. They concentrate on attending weekly and monthly religious ceremonies and events. A heightened emphasis is placed on understanding where the potential mate is from, meeting their parents, and spending time learning what makes them happy, sad, indifferent, or excited. A friendship is formed through learning, and a common bond is established over their shared views on various subjects in which they both participate. Clearly, these are distinct approaches to the same problem. We can apply this idea to the current state of affairs in the investment world.

As of August 2025, in US public markets, there are currently approximately 4,300 ETFs (exchange traded funds) as compared to 4,200 publicly traded companies. In terms of recent trends, the number of ETFs grew by approximately 4 per day in 2025, while the available publicly traded companies continued to shrink, losing nearly 500 in 2024 alone, down from 6,500 in 1997. I bring this up because the investment world has been moving to a passive approach for a long time, and the amount of capital allocated to index and ETF-based approaches is now [greater than the active ](https://www.globaltrading.net/passive-funds-extend-their-dominance-in-equity-investments-in-2024/)methods.

Over the last few decades, the S&P 500 has been the star performer of all indexes. Currently, 35% of the S&P 500 is made up of seven companies. Many other ETFs have a similar dynamic where a few companies constitute a heavy weight within the instrument. Prominent examples include the QQQ, IVV, SPLG, VOO, VGT, and TOPT, not to mention the Ark fund complex. Investors are drawn to the lower risk, ease, and cost of indexes and ETFs and have been rewarded by owning instruments tied to large tech companies, which have grown substantially. The enthusiasm for artificial intelligence over the last few years has led to high-profile recent offerings like ARTY, CHAT, BAI, AGNT, and IVES. Investors who adopt this approach believe what has been working will continue to work. The current valuations of these assets are, let’s be kind, historically elevated. How do I approach the market knowing these facts?

One caveat, I am an active investor, so I am biased, and I am talking my book. ETFs are made up of different assets, but in most or many cases, the holdings are individual public companies. One is a derivative of the other. If you understand derivatives, you know the secondary is a function of the primary. As such, what matters is the performance of the core companies. The ETFs will rise, and fall based on those entities. So, for an active investor, more attention to ETFs is good because less capital is directed toward finding and analyzing individual companies. The number of individually listed enterprises shrinking means the strongest survive. History has proven that Darwinian concepts are applicable in markets as well. It has long been understood that the small and micro-cap areas are the most inefficient areas of the market. Inefficiency is good for active investors because it means mis-pricing. It is also excellent for active investment because if one is accurate about the analysis of a small company, the runway for expansion is much greater than a bigger entity. Conversely, investors who allocate capital into areas where there is more competition and great enthusiasm are placing a great deal of belief in the premise that massive amounts of capital allocation will yield acceptable returns. When large amounts of money are involved, just because it is spent doesn’t mean an above-average return is earned. Look at what Stevie baby spent on the Mets payroll this year, and uh, no playoffs again. In sum, less competition, fewer investors looking, mis-priced assets, large expansion possibilities versus greater numbers of instruments, top-heavy weighted assets, recent outperformance, and elevated valuations. Capital will flow where it is best treated. Markets change, like nearly everything else, though often it takes decades, not years for the difference to become evident. What one chooses is based on their own perceptions, just like choosing an ideal mate.

Mods. I understand this isn’t a typical value post. However, if the headline claims are true and $BMNR does hold $13B in ETH, this is the easiest value play ever. Just buy when Stock < NAV.

However, here are my concerns.

BitMine is a strange one. Their balance sheet shows only about $7M in assets, yet their press releases claim they hold over $13B worth of Ethereum. If that were true, they’d either be reporting billions of crypto on their balance sheet like MicroStrategy does, or they’d disclose assets under custody like Coinbase. They do neither. Instead, they issue sensational PRs while filing bare-bones financials with the SEC. To make things stranger, their previous auditor was banned by the PCAOB for issuing false audit opinions, and their new auditor is another tiny firm with its own compliance history. There’s no clear source of funds for these supposed ETH purchases, no custody revenues, and no on-chain proof. It looks less like a real business and more like a shell pumping hype with numbers that don’t add up.

The whole sector has been whacked hard over the last few months. And it doesn’t help that they’re showing high correlation — one stock’s poor earnings hurt all other stocks, but good earnings for one don’t lift others (naturally).

1nuonf9,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 16:42:21,Constellation Software - The King is Gone,"The market is panicking about Constellation Software after its founder, Mark Leonard, resigned. The stock is down nearly 30% from its highs, caused by fears over AI and a scary looking Q2 earnings report. I believe this is a massive overreaction and a great opportunity for long-term investors.

The biggest reason for the panic is that Mark Leonard left. He's seen as the Warren Buffett of Canada. People think the magic is gone with him. It doesn't help that AI is coming for them either. The fear is that generative AI will make their huge portfolio of niche software obsolete. The Q2 earnings also looked terrible. Net income dropped by a shocking 68%.

These fears are all very real. The thing is the company is simply a machine. Leonard built a decentralised system designed to run without him. It's not reliant on one person. His replacement is a 30-year company insider, ensuring continuity. They aren't ignoring AI either. Management held a rare call to address concerns and explained that hundreds of their business units are already integrating AI to improve products and efficiency.  
  
The Q2 earnings also weren't actually bad. That 68% drop in net income I talked about was due to non-cash accounting quirks (a massive foreign exchange loss and a charge related to the rising value of their successful Topicus spin-off). The important number, free cash flow, was actually UP 20%. The business is still printing money.

The recent sell-off is driven by fear, not fundamentals. The panic has created a chance to buy a world-class compounder at a discounted price. The valuation is now much more reasonable, trading at around 23x P/FCF. To me, this is a compelling long-term opportunity.

WSJ EXCLUSIVE

By Lauren Thomas, Ben Dummett and Benoît Morenne

Sept. 30, 2025 3:49 pm ET

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is in talks to buy Occidental Petroleum’s petrochemical business for around $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal, which would be Berkshire’s largest since 2022, could come together within days, the people said. 

Houston-based Occidental is largely known for its oil-and-gas operations. The company has a market value of around $46 billion and already counts Berkshire as its largest shareholder. 

Occidental’s petrochemical division, OxyChem, manufactures and sells chemicals for use in applications including chlorinating water, recycling batteries and producing paper. The unit generated nearly $5 billion in sales in the 12 months ended in June. 

Assuming talks don’t fall apart, the OxyChem deal would be Buffett’s second big bet on chemicals. In 2011, Berkshire acquired specialty-chemicals producer, Lubrizol, for close to $10 billion, including debt. 

The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Occidental was in talks for a $10 billion deal to sell OxyChem, without identifying the buyer. The last major deal Berkshire did was in 2022, when it agreed to pay $11.6 billion to buy insurer Alleghany. 

Buffett, 95, got involved with Occidental in 2019, as Chief Executive Vicki Hollub was trying to outbid Chevron to buy Anadarko Petroleum. In a trip facilitated by Bank of America Chief Brian Moynihan, Hollub traveled to Nebraska to visit Buffett, whose company agreed to buy $10 billion of preferred shares in Occidental to bolster her $38 billion offer. 

Occidental’s fortunes have waxed and waned since then. The deal saddled the company with debt and attracted criticism from activist investor Carl Icahn. Buffett doubled down as Icahn exited, eventually buying up roughly 28% of its shares. The company’s shares more recently have come under pressure with oil prices lower.

Occidental has been selling noncore assets to raise cash to pay down debt. As of August, it said it had repaid $7.5 billion of debt. 

Berkshire, on the other hand, has been sitting on a massive cash pile. The company’s cash and Treasury bills sat at a record $344 billion at the end of June, raising investors’ eyebrows.

Buffett has said the company still prefers owning businesses, though has suggested that finding the right ones to buy can be hard. “Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned,” Buffett wrote earlier this year. 

The famed investor plans to retire from his role as CEO at the end of the year and hand the reins to Greg Abel. Buffett will remain chairman.",111,31,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nuojke/berkshire_hathaway_near_10_billion_deal_for/,new,Buffett,0.98
1nuntsi,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 16:11:46,The Dark side of Johnson and Johnson(J&J),"This post dives deep into the lawsuits filed on J&J, Thought it's common knowledge as an investor and analyst but then got to know that this common knowledge is not so common, So...Writing up this post. Did all the research myself and used PineAI from [PineGap.ai](http://PineGap.ai) to get better access to reports and  fillings (Hehe,Hard to not plug in as an analyst). This is not to defame anyone, Would love to know your views.  
  
Everyone knows Johnson & Johnson,household name for baby products,but it has a sinister side that is linked to the U.S. opioid epidemic.   
For long known as a gentle brand, J&J contributed to lethal epidemic. During 1990s J&J was aware of its fentanyl based opioid Duragesic which caused addictions but still promoted opioids as safe to treat chronic pain by targeting doctors and nursing facilities with communications that minimized risk.  
J&J had subsidaries like Noramco...Which were responsible for about 20–25% of raw materials like thebaine used in U.S. opioids back in the 2000s...which later led to a surge in prescriptions.   
It then contributed to an opioid crisis that has taken more than 700,000 lives since 1999 and provisional data frm CDC is estimating around 87,000 deaths in 2024.  
J&J dropped millions into patient advocacy groups,like the American pain foundation, to downplay the addiction risks and push against limits on prescriptions.   
Internal emails from 1998 even called these groups 'megaphone' and during testimony in 2021, executives tried to call this addiction as a societal issue. Societal Issue?Seriously?  
  
But then what were the consequences? J&J agreed to a $5 billion settlement in 2021 to resolve most opioid lawsuits. with payments over 9 years funding treatment and prevention. By 2024 states like Washington received their shares almost $149.5 million. Most of the thousands of lawsuits have settled, with only a few remaining in 2025.

I felt this might be a way to offset Sirius XM declining revenues.  I also liked the reduction in share count and dividend.  I thought if any of this came to pass the market might re rate them to a higher multiple.  The bit below is simply an AI overview of my original thoughts I think it summerized it much better than I ever could.  Are there any other holders who purchased with a similar view to potential future revenue streams for Sirius ?

As a side note, i would think that companies like Garmin will soon see their products like inreach become obsolete as more phones and other devices end up connected to a satellite network.

I'd like to share a list of companies that, based on my analysis, appear to be trading at a significant discount to their intrinsic value, offering a potential margin of safety. My approach is to find good businesses that are temporarily out of favor with the market.

I've focused on quantifiable metrics like P/B ratio, debt levels, and cash flow generation. Here are a few examples from the list that I believe fit the value investing framework:

* **Allos ($ALOS3 - Brazil):** A classic Graham-style play. The market is valuing this real estate company at approximately 50% of its asset value, and it operates with no long-term debt burdening its cash flow.
* **Barclays ($BCS - UK):** This bank is currently trading below its book value with a P/B of 0.81, despite a history of consistent and growing profits. Seems like a clear disconnect between price and value.
* **Global Payments ($GPN - US):** A wonderful company, in Buffett's terms, that has seen its price fall. Its strong financials and ability to generate cash remain intact, presenting what could be a compelling long-term opportunity.

I'd appreciate any critiques on this analysis from a value perspective. Do you see strong, durable moats in any of these businesses, or are there value traps I might be overlooking?

I currently own these three stocks in my portfolio with equal-weight, 33% each.

First of all, I want to hear some advice about my first stock.

  
1. [Gambling.com](http://Gambling.com) (GAMB)

This company is rapidly growing with several M&As. It has a low valuation, although a temporary profit decline has pushed its PE ratio to 20, which seems high.

This company originally does performance marketing for online gambling sites worldwide. It stems from the growth of global online gambling industry. Before 2024, the company has done M&A to acquire influential domains. [https://www.rotowire.com](https://www.rotowire.com) is one of them.

By the way, in 2024, this company did M&A with Odds Holdings owning OddsJam which is the #1 platform for quantitative/mathmetical/calculative online gamblers. Revenue from this part increased by four times compared to last year.

The temporary profit decline is because of *SAFE(Simple Agreement for Future Equity*). It means that the greater performance Odds Holdings will show, the better rewards that components of Odds Holdings will get. Because Odds Holdings demonstrated better performance than it contracted, a cost was incurred for accounting purposes without any cash outflow. This also explains the seemingly low current ratio, which fell from above 1 to 0.59.

I think this stock price plunge is quite irrational. Because I strongly believe the profit will be improved from next quarter. My target price is around $23, up from the current $8.2.

1nuaotq,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 07:31:48,Morio Denki 6647,"I bought another Japanese net-net for my portfolio. Here are the main characteristics:

* 4x Earnings
* 79% of NCAV
* 53% of TBV
* Recent repurchases

[https://cristianleon1200.substack.com/p/morio-denki-6647](https://cristianleon1200.substack.com/p/morio-denki-6647)

Morio Denki—TSE: 6647—is a tiny railway equipment manufacturer located in Tokyo, Japan. With a market cap of just ¥2.6 billion, or \~$17 million, it's the smallest company I’ve bought on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Here are a couple of examples of what they manufacture:

Similar to the previous Japanese companies I’ve shared, what I like about Morio Denki is its solid balance sheet, stable business, cheap valuation, and capital allocation improvement.

**Balance Sheet**

Unfortunately, most of this company’s current assets aren’t in cash, only 16%; even adding the marketable securities, you get that only 39% of the current assets are 100% liquid. The weakest line of Morio’s current assets, inventory, represents a modest 38%. While less than ideal, the fact that inventory represents a bigger portion of current assets than in other net-nets doesn’t make me discard 6647 right away, because the ratio of current assets to total liabilities is still >2, thus giving enough protection in case of liquidation. 

**Business**

Like many other small Japanese companies, Morio has been in business for over 100 years, having been founded in 1911. Over the last decade, revenue has been stable, oscillating between ¥7 and 10 billion, with no operating or net losses. The last 10-year average operating income is ¥369 million, and the net income is ¥232 million. This means the business has generated an average 5.6% return over ¥4.15 billion of average equity. While this is not great at all, at least the business is not losing money and can keep existing for the foreseeable future.

**Valuation**

Morio Denki is trading at 79% of its net current asset value and approximately 10 times normalized earnings. From a simple liquidation analysis, the business is clearly trading at a discount; you’re getting the current assets at a 21% discount with the machines and properties for free. If we say that the tangible assets can generate close to a 6% return, and the business can be purchased at half of the net tangible assets, you are getting an 11-12% return on your investment. Even if this hypothetical return never occurs, and the company needs to be liquidated, buying at a deep enough discount, we are unlikely to lose money.

**Capital Allocation**

Morio Denki has adopted new policies to improve capital returns and the price-to-book ratio. In 2024, the company repurchased 2.1% of the shares outstanding. This year so far, they’ve repurchased 1.5%. While these numbers are not anywhere close to those of other aggressive repurchasers, it's adding value to remaining shareholders. In their recent press release, “Measures to achieve management that takes capital costs and stock prices into consideration,” they stated that their objective is to make the stock price closer to 1x book value. And these repurchases are the first step.

A more effective way to improve the price-to-book ratio in Japan is to increase the dividend payout ratio by announcing a 30-50% dividend payout ratio, or a dividend on equity policy. In the last decade, the dividend per share has oscillated between ¥30 and ¥60 per share; by adopting a 40% payout ratio, the business would pay around ¥80-90 per share, bringing more predictable returns for investors. 

While they haven’t adopted a set dividend payout ratio or a dividend on equity policy, they check out another variable that I look for in Japanese net-nets: tangible book value per share growth.

Tangible book value per share has compounded at 5.6% in the last decade, which is not terrible considering they’ve paid decent dividends over time. In the 2025 bar, there is a 12% growth with respect to the previous year; this higher growth is due in part to good business performance, but also due to share repurchases at ½ of TBV. In August, they repurchased an extra 21k shares, or 1.5%, at \~50% of TBV. This is clearly accretive to shareholder wealth and will boost TBV/share growth. TBV/share growth shows that the business is not burning away the shareholders’ capital and is actually compounding it over time.  

**How might this investment go wrong?**

1. I do not have any special insight into the business. I do not know if management are crooks or if the business will become obsolete.
2. No further shareholder returns are conducted. The company might not conduct further share repurchases; not returning capital in Japan will likely make the stock a value trap.
3. In the past, the company has implemented measures against large share purchases by other entities. This might mean that they are reluctant to be acquired, which might block a rapid return of capital.

Trading below 80% of NCAV and ½ of tangible book value, while repurchasing shares, Morio Denki 6647 has a low downside with potential satisfactory return in my basket of Japanese net-nets.

Long Morio Denki 6647.

Do you think the UNP/NSC merger will be value accretive, or are you worried about the price (as a UNP shareholder) and the additional debt of the combined entity?

Railroads have been by far my worse performing investment. I predicted more industrial integration between US, Canada and Mexico and an increase in trade, but boy was I wrong. In addition, I think the economic landscape is shifting to less higher quality products and software, so the volume of goods transported might increase at a slower pace than it has in the last decade (think cars sales for example). Also Business to consumer has lower margins and higher costs.

Still railroads have their infrastructure in place, are clearly cashflow positive, and pay a small dividend every year and buy back a few shares every quarter, so I don’t think they will lose lots of money long term.

Honestly, I am not a fan of NCS reliance on coal (although this administration doesn’t hate the product), and I am a bit concerned of the additional debt taken over by UNP, as well as the 27% share dilution.

However, the management is unlikely to bankrupt such a profitable company, and I can only see advantages owning such a big chunk of US commercial rail long term, at least for shareholders with a massive time horizon.

Given the whole stock market bubble debate, I think the safe haven assets like precious metals are looking pretty attractive right now.

Sadly I don’t have 6 figures to start dabbling in the futures market but I found the SPDR Gold Trust ETF which looks a bit more in my price range. It’s currently trading at 352 with the last big rallies around the 300 mark at the start of the year. I was thinking of buying in at around 340 on an expiry of Jan 2027 (delta of 0.68). 

Obviously I know there is risk with this play but betting against the market is inherently risky and my position size is going to be relatively small compared to my capital (much less that 5%). I understand that it would be vulnerable to interest rate changes but I get the impression that the Fed are likely to hold these for the 3-6 months or only make minor tweaks (unless Trump manages to sack them all).

1nu7d38,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 04:05:43,Thoughts on Boyd Gaming (the other BYD),"Literally has all the good things you want to see in a company.

- Year over year growth in revenue and gross profit 
- Share buybacks over the last few years
- Margins like a tech company
- Valuation like Lululemon / Paypal

### So what do they do?

Boyd Gaming Corporation primarily operates casinos and gaming entertainment facilities. Their customers are largely local residents from the areas surrounding their properties, as well as tourists visiting those regions. Demographically, they attract a broad range of adults, with a focus on those who enjoy gaming, dining, and entertainment. The company's revenue comes mainly from gaming operations (slot machines and table games), followed by food and beverage sales, hotel stays, and other entertainment offerings.

So the revenue distribution is 70% casinos, 8% food & drinks, 5% hotel, 11% online gambling, and the rest is just random things like ATM concession, retail, convention, etc.

Midwest & South USA makes up 55%, Las Vegas strip 6%, Las Vegas locals 24%, and rest is online.

### What makes them different?

Boyd Gaming targets a specific customer segment: gaming enthusiasts with tighter budgets, primarily in regional markets, rather than competing directly with high-end resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. This allows them to dominate niche markets and cater to local preferences. So this makes them harder to displace and they are less centralized.

Loyalty programs create sticky customers. Furthermore, Boyd is strategically expanding its online gaming presence, which diversifies revenue streams and reaches a broader customer base.

### Why invest?

Consistently beats EPS and revenue estimates. Returns money to shareholders. Operational efficiency. Solid history of outperformance. Manageable debt. PE of 13ish.

### Where is the growth?

Expansion includes investments in property expansions and new developments, such as a casino resort in Norfolk, Virginia, scheduled for late 2027. And this is on top of digital expansion in gambling every year, 33.2% growth YoY in Q2.cAnd they sold their stake in fanduel and are using it to pay debt so expect less interest payments in the future.

I already have a large slug of my portfolio in cash/mmf (30% a la Buffett). 50% in a global ETF. 20% in US small caps (s&p600). 

As I continue to dripfeed more in and this bull run continues id really like to pivot my portfolio gradually into resilient stocks. Thus giving me even more dry powder to buy quality stocks at better prices when/if market turns. 

Right now it's easy to find quality, but they're all more than 25x forward earnings and im not keen to pay it. The trouble I'm finding is that the classic recommendations like Walmart are already really pricey... and I believe would also tumble during a correction/ crash. 

Are there any equities out there that i could park my money in to suit the following criteria:

1. 7%+ total return
2. Would not fall much (or at all) during a downturn. I'm thinking that probably requires a moderate or low forward pe

1ntyl2h,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 20:15:36,Nordson is Proving That Old Dogs Can Still Learn New Tricks,"**Actionable Insight:**

Nordson has been around over 70 years and quietly increasing their dividend for 61 of them. The company has built its moat and riches by exploiting the niches. The company earns a high ROIC and in the last 15 years has been quietly making acquisitive moves towards growth and diversifying away from cyclical industries. If this low beta company can continue to execute within guidance and realize their growth targets then current \~18x EV/EBITDA seems overly modest and could rerate closer to peer Graco at \~20x for a price target of $310

**Intro:**

When I think about whether a company is going to be a good investment a few things come to mind, but the very first thing is will this company be here in 10 years. That's what I like about Nordson, this company has been around for awhile and I would wager it will continue to be. This is not a moon shot company, its a quiet compounder that will continue to generate cash flow in the background.

However, unlike a typical bond proxy this behemoth of a company is still taking swings for the fences. And given its track record, when the company swings its worth paying attention too. With an average EBITDA of around 30% and a ROIC hovering above 12% growth is the best path for success. Thankfully for the investors, management agrees.

**A Little About Nordson:**

For decades the company has played the part of the quiet cyclical compounder. Founded in 1954 on airless spray patents, it built its reputation in Industrial Precision Solutions, the hidden workhorses of packaging and coatings. Anything but sexy, this company was quietly sealing cereal boxes, coating electronics, and adding polymers with microscopic accuracy.

By 2010, revenue topped $1 Billion. Soon after, Nordson expanded into the high growth segment of Medical & Fluid Solutions with acquisitions in medical tubing and connectors. Some years go by and the company diversifies further into Advanced Technology Solutions through electronics and semiconductor dispensing.

**The New CEO:**

In 2019 a bold new character enters the scene: CEO Sundaram ""Naga"" Nagarajan. What he brought with him: An Ascend strategy focusing on 6-8% growth, 10-12% EPS growth, and the operating discipline of the NBS Next Framework. The message was subtle but clear: Nordson wasnt just defending its crown, but its looking to expand.

Immediately Naga's tenure would be tested by fire. The Covid pandemic would soon take the world by surprise. Factories slowed, polymers slumped, supply chains buckled. Where others struggled, Nordson's armor -> 57% of revenue from consumables, held firm. Margins barely dipped, proving its aristocratic steadiness. Emboldened by the trial, the CEO dared to reach further.

**Semiconductors Anyone?**

Im August 2022 Nordson stunned its own playbook, paying $380M for CyberOptics, a semiconductor inspection firm just a tenth its size. The company paid 4x revenue and 20x EBITDA. For a conservative acquirer this was audacious. The bet: that ""dispense + inspect"" would give Nordson a seat at the semiconductor packaging table, where chiplets, AI, and EV batteries demand perfect precision. The trade off: Lower segment margines of 24% but a real taste of secular growth.

**Can you pass me the medical valves please?**

Then came Atrion in 2024. $800M for medical valves and fluid components. Boring, high-margin, indispensable. Hospitals don't cycle with GDP; aging populations and a growing demand for minimally invasive procedures keep demand steady. If CyberOptics was the growth swing, Atrion was the ballast. Together goodwill swelled from $1.8B to $2.8B but redefined Nordson's portfolio: semis for upside, medtech for stabilization.

**So why pick Nordson?**

Here's where the narrative sharpens. Nordson's peers: Graco, IDEX, Donaldson, ITW... all remain incrementalists. They bolt on adjacencies, protect margins, return cash. Solid, but unsurprising.  Nordson stands alone in deliberately trying to transform from ""mature aristocrat"" into a ""growth compounder."" This is the crux of the reason I believe Nordson should be trading a higher multiple relative to peers.

**The Big List of If's**

Today Nordson trades at \~17-18x EV/EBITDA. This places it pricier than IDEX and Donaldson (\~15x) but less than Graco (\~20x). If CyberOptics sustains double-digit growth, if Atrion proves its ballast, if NBS Next unlocks the promised 10-12% EPS growth, Nordson has a path to the peer high end: 19-20x, $275-310 pps. That leaves 15-25% upside, not from financial engineering but from a deliberate evolution.

**What I am worried about:**

This is a low beta play. Even in a bear case I am not overly concerned about drawdowns or whether or not this company will continue to pay dividends. In my estimation, a bear case leaves the largest cost being missed opportunity elsewhere.

Semiconductors are arguably near peak cycle and would whiplash anytime, or could continue to run for a few years. The global exposure of the company helps to diversify income streams, but it also subjects the investor to fx risks, And the company has taken on a lot of goodwill, any signs that the investments are not paying off and there is a real risk that will have to be written down and can negatively effect the earnings in the future. Even though to date in the companies 70+ years this has not happened, the past is not a reflection of future performance.

The company does have some defense against these risks. A strong balance sheet, strong cash flow, moderate leverage and a consumanbles-driven model give it protection peers envy.

**Bottom Line:**

Nordson has a very compelling narrative. Its not just a good company at a fair price. Its the only aristocrat in its class deliberately reaching for more. Risking reputation and margine comfort to earn growth optionality. It feels like a founder ran company. If it succeeds, investors wont just own a quiet compounder. Theyll own an aristocrat that has evolved.

I work as a scientist for a large US tech company where management tries to enforce AI. But literally nobody uses AI tools. Or should I say, nobody has become more productive with existing tools. It takes more time to correct codes generated than writing from scratch or leveraging existing codes. It does help here and there, but NOTHING disruptive. I save maybe 3h of work per week, and I am being super generous. Not even talking about the infinite revenue loop created between the main AI actors. Time reveals everything, and this is no exception.

Now, there have been several posts on '*where to invest today? what are your strong picks in a period of ATH?*' So writing here where I have invested a large portion of my value portfolio, waiting patiently that money flows back. 

  
Here it is: **US insurance providers**. I have USD 110k invested as of today. Why? PE lower than usual, high revenue growth and money likely rotated from the sector to stupid AI. I have collected the best ones (according to me) such that you do not have to. 

Criteria: low PE (and lower than usual), high and consistent revenue growth, profitable, growing or constant margins, continuous stock price increase with a decrease in the last year (so not ATH), large cap:

* Chubb
* PGR
* ACGL
* AJG (okay PE is does not match the criteria above, but it systematicall increases over time with performance, so still invested in)
* Optional: TRV
* UNH
* ELV

**High risk (not fitting the above criteria, but could go to the moon):**

* LMND
* ROOT

Cherry on the cake: such portfolio has outperformed the SP500 in the last decade while being less affected during downturn periods. Insurance is not going anywhere, it is a necessity that grows with demographics and increased frequency of large events. Sector has underperformed but money will come back.

How does the combined inflation of 30%+ in the past 10 years (and beyond, for that matter) find its way into company valuations when evaluating a given company?

For a given company; Google, Oracle, Nvidia, whatever when analysis is performed, whether it be discounted cash flows, assets vs. liab, etc. - when you come to a value all else equal, and 7% inflation for the prior year, would that company not start with a value of 107% of its prior year valuation? Is it standard practice to then multiply that by 1.07 to get estimated dollar value? As the company you are evaluating is an asset, that is being valued in a currency that is worth less than it was in a prior year.

I'm wondering about market capitalization of 2 very similar companies DoorDash vs Delivery Hero.

A couple of statistics

**DoorDash:**

*Market cap: 115 B USD*

*Revenue H1 2025: 6,3 B USD (22,8% Y/Y growth)*

*EBITA: 1,25 B USD*

*EBITA margin: 2,7%*

**Delivery Hero:**

*Market cap: 8,5 B USD*

*Revenue H1 2025:* 8,5 *B USD (24,2% Y/Y growth)*

*EBITA: 0,48 B USD*

*EBITA margin: 1,7%*

Both companies look quite similar and seem to be at a comparable stage of development. Delivery Hero is even growing slightly faster (24.2% vs. 22.8%), despite being the larger company.  
However, DoorDash’s market capitalization is 13.5 times higher. Is this mainly due to the difference in stock market listing, or am I missing something?

My mom retirement fund is 1.1m, she worked hard to make that money and now she's not sure what to do with it. Vast majority of the money came from real estate over 30 years. 

I am not an experienced investor, but I understand that  diversification helps and timing the market is almost impossible. So through meeting with CFPs and CFAs, doing my own research I have suggested the following: 

10% (~100k) in physical gold
25% (~250k) in flex GIC returning 5.8%
75% (~750k) in the equities (650k in diversified ETFs and 100k in individual stocks).

The basis for putting 35% outside the market is to protect her for at least 3-4 years of income in case the market crashes. She needs ~100k per year, she doesn't own a property and she helps my sister go through university.

My questions:
1. What do you think of the approach, any critiques? 
2. Where would you invest the 100k in individual stocks? I think rare earths will grow significantly in the US, and then some defensive positions like UNH and LULU (high cf, good pe compared to industry). 

Again, this is all based on my readings, talking to ""experts"" and my research.

1ntkuix,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 11:19:55,My thesis on Crocs $CROX,"1. They own the word ""Crocs"". Off-brands / knockouts / counterfeit have been common since day 1, but they're all referred to as ""Crocs"" (just like ""Band-Aid""). When someone wants to buy Crocs-like shoes, they'll go to Amazon and search ""Crocs"" and buy whatever come up, which will usually be real Crocs. This is why they maintain a very high gross margin selling a easy-to-make product.
2. Low capex and high ROE. They don't manufacture the shoes, they outsource from China and Vietnam. If necessary, they can easily switch to Mexico or India etc, because it's low tech. Again the moat is the name, not the tech.
3. After you buy the shoes, they always work well, the product is simple, no way to mess it up (have defects etc). For people who like those shoes, they know the last purchase worked well and the next purchase will work well again, so they keep buying more, maybe for a lifetime.
4. Share price dropped 30% in a day after last quarterly report, because they lowered the earning forecast due to ""uncertain tariff environment in the US"", but I think it's not an issue - it doesn't change the demand, and all competitors are equally affected. I think it's an opportunity to buy. Some insiders bought it too at that time.
5. They now have a 20 PE because last quarter there was a huge impairment of goodwill (they overpaid to acquire another brand which performed poorly) so GAAP earning were low. If you screen by PE, you won't find this stock, which I think is why nobody is buying the dip. But if you read the last quarterly report, their non-GAAP earnings was much higher, the real PE is less than 7.
6. I personally observed that some kids nowadays call slides ""Crocs"" too, maybe because they grew up in a household where the parents wear Crocs indoors and don't wear slides, and they call them Crocs, so the kid grew up thinking all indoor shoes are called Crocs.

1ntkqwp,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 11:16:00,European small cap gem ?,"Hello everyone,

I'm in the process of rebuilding my Small-Cap portfolio (it's a portfolio that benefits from a tax advantage), and I absolutely don't know what to take. In fact, I had bet quite a lot on a company that just crashed on the stock market due to excellent results that weren't enough for the investors, and all that with a nice capital increase that represents more than 12% of the capital.

The main issue is no etf is available. There are some available ""fund"" for this type of portfolio, but they can't beat the market, and much worse ...

I did have my watchlist, but once again I missed everything: Theon International and Fincantieri have exploded because coincidentally the defense sector is rising again (similar to Hensoldt...). I had AVIO, but because I wanted to make an effort for a rigorous analysis, I sold it, and the stock naturally took off (24 hours after the sale, while the stock was stuck at 32 Euros despite good news).

Today I'm trying to find good Small Caps in full momentum again, but I find absolutely nothing. Unfortunately, the German market doesn't fit into the portfolio because it's outside of Euronext. So I have to find some on the stock markets: **French, Dutch, Irish, Belgian, Italian, and Norwegian...**

1ntjrmr,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 10:38:46,Canadian National Railway(CNI): A Buffett-Style Compounder hiding in plain Sight?,"So, before we get into this. I analyse businesses for a living, What I post is not necessarily stocks related...But great businesses that will fundamentally will make you good bucks in the stock market  
Keep in mind...it's not a stock advice:

When great long term compounders are mentioned, railroads do not come to mind for many people. Warren Buffett famously bought Burlington Northern (BNSF), calling it an ""all-in wager on the economic future of the United States"". If you dig in the space, Canadian National Railway (CNI) is possibly the most ignored example today.

\-Why Are Railroads Great Businesses?

\-Natural monopolies: The capital cost, regulation, and land rights needed to replicate a rail network almost makes it impossible for more players to enter. Rail roads are almost by design oligopolies.  
\-Pricing power and efficiency: Rail is the cheapest and most energy efficient mode of transport for freight over long distances. This will keep them viable businesses even if we live in a world that is obsessed with tech.  
\-Inflation hedge: Many contracts have fuel surcharges and inflation pass through, this protects margins for decades.

Why CNI?  
Canadian National is unique: with a single rail line, it has more reach than any North American railroad - Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. The geographic footprint generates strategic advantages that no other Class I railroads can duplicate.

\-Diversified freight mix: Grain, petroleum, intermodal, forestry products, nothing particular dominates revenue.  
\-Operating discipline: CNI is widely regarded as one of the most efficient operators in the industry, with industry-leading operating ratios.  
\-Cross-border trade exposure: As U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade flows increase, CNI sits in a structurally advantaged position.

Capital Allocation & Durability

\-Strong free cash flow that supports dividends+buybacks without jeopardizing reinvestment.  
\-Enormous reinvestment moat: every dollar spent on track upgrades, locomotives, and technology widens the gap competitors would need billions to close.  
\-Net Revenue hitting- 4,272M which is a bit higher side for this industry.  
\-Long runway: freight rail is not going away;it remains a backbone of continental logistics.

I am an Analyst but will refrain from commenting on the stock price. Tho, I am bullish on the company I'll just wait for it's quarterly earning report dropping on 31st October. Will check out [PineGap.ai](http://PineGap.ai) for consensus and earnings report summary and take decisions on the same.

This sector involves high R&D and requires capital, but the overall market opportunity is large, potentially reaching tens of billions of dollars by 2030.

Currently, the central competitive advantage isn't just the core technology (which often relies on shared platforms like NVIDIA) but regulatory compliance and geographic scale.

The Thesis: The most defensible moat over the next five years will belong to the companies that successfully secure Level 4 permits across varied global jurisdictions (e.g., the US, China, and the Middle East). Why? Because there's a system (weride) validated and approved by transportation authorities in distinct regulatory environments has a significant advantage over a single-market operator. Gaining these approvals requires substantial resource commitment, which functions as a strong barrier to entry.

This perspective suggests that when evaluating these companies, we should prioritize two key intangible assets: regulatory asset accumulation and geographic first-mover status, as these will underpin future business operations.

1ntimc1,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 09:53:06,"Deckers (DECK): 52% Drop, 104% Upside? A DCF Case Study","Deckers (DECK) has fallen 52% from its January 2025 high of $223.98 to $105.77, even though the company just reported record revenue and earnings. The market seems focused on tariff risks, weaker guidance, and slowing growth in both UGG and Hoka, which made it an interesting test case for a disciplined DCF analysis.

Data from our platform, using analyst consensus forecasts, points to an initial 12.4% growth rate derived through weighted regression across estimates. Growth is then tapered gradually to 3% over a ten-year horizon, which avoids the unrealistic cliff effect of traditional two-stage models. The model applies a 22.3% EBITDA margin, consistent with DECK’s historical efficiency and pricing power. For the discount rate, it incorporates Damodaran’s methodology, starting with an unlevered industry beta and relevering it for DECK’s capital structure. This results in a WACC of 7.2%, reflecting current market risk premiums.

On those assumptions, the model generated $31.3 billion in enterprise value, with 71% coming from terminal value and the rest from projected cash flows. After adjusting for net cash, that translated to an equity value of $32.9 billion, or $215.8 per share. Compared with the current price, the implied upside is about 104%. Sensitivity testing shows that even with more conservative 8% growth assumptions, the upside remains around 66%. On the other hand, raising the discount rate above 10% would nearly erase the gap, which shows how sensitive the valuation is to risk assumptions.

The analysis highlights both the opportunity and the limitations of DCF. On one hand, the market seems to be pricing DECK at barely half of what a consensus-driven model suggests. On the other hand, more than 70% of the value comes from terminal assumptions, which leaves a lot riding on long-term execution and competitive dynamics. Add in the uncertainties of tariffs and geopolitics, and it’s easy to see why sentiment has pushed the stock down.

DCF suggests the market may be underpricing DECK’s fundamentals, but the result rests on assumptions about long-term growth durability and risk premiums. To me, it’s less a “back up the truck” case and more an example of how sentiment-driven dislocations can create opportunities if you’re comfortable with the embedded risks.

Would be interested to hear how others in this community would approach DECK. Does it look like an attractive value setup, or a potential trap disguised by optimistic assumptions?

The first rule of investing in any company is simple: know what they do and how they make money for shareholders.

# Overview

TeraWulf operates as an owner and operator of vertically integrated, industrial-scale digital infrastructure across the United States. The core strategy emphasizes environmentally sustainable operations, utilizing predominantly zero-carbon energy sources. This vertical integration, coupled with management’s deep expertise in the energy infrastructure sector—spanning decades in development, ownership, and operation of large-scale energy assets —provides a foundational competitive advantage in securing and delivering reliable, compliant power to highly demanding computation clients. The business model is rapidly evolving from a singular focus on proprietary computing (Bitcoin mining) to a dual-segment approach, incorporating high-margin, long-term hosting.

# Segment A: Bitcoin Self-Mining

This segment is defined by high volume and high volatility. As of December 2024, WULF achieved 9.7 EH/s of installed self-mining capacity, representing a significant 94.0% year-over-year increase. This scale exposes WULF directly to Bitcoin price fluctuations and network difficulty adjustments, reinforcing the stock’s high historical volatility (Beta 4.18).

Operationally, the self-mining segment faces structural cost challenges. In December 2024, the average power cost was approximately $0.078/kWh, leading to a high average power cost of $62,805 per bitcoin mined (excluding credits from demand response). This cost structure is considerably higher than that of peers who rely on subsidized or less sustainable power sources (as detailed . The premium paid for sustainable energy is not an operational flaw if it is the enabling factor for the high-margin HPC business. The mining segment essentially functions as the anchor load and operational proof-of-concept for the green energy infrastructure, allowing the company to charge a premium in the high-value contracted segment, which ultimately outweighs the higher energy cost in the mining segment.

# Segment B: HPC Hosting

This segment represents the future of WULF’s business, it involves leveraging the company’s vertically integrated infrastructure to provide compute-ready data center space for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI clients.

The quality of revenue is exceptionally high due to recent contract wins:

1. **Core42:** Secured for over 70 MW of digital infrastructure, representing total revenue exceeding $1 billion over an initial 10-year term.
2. **Fluidstack/Google:** Anchor agreements for 360+ MW of critical IT load, representing approximately $6.7 billion in contracted revenue over the initial 10-year term.

The lease with Fluidstack is expected to bring in over $670 million a year in revenue with site level net operating margins of roughly 85%. Importantly, Google is providing a $3.2 billion backstop for FluidStacks lease obligations in exchange for warrants representing about 14% of WULF’s equity, an extraordinary vote of confidence from one of the most influential players in AI.

Secondly, they brought in Cayuga. They executed an 80 year ground lease with a purchase option, securing exclusive rights to develop up to 400 MWs of digital infrastructure on a fully equipped site with high capacity transmission, industrial water intake and redundant fiber. It is expected to bring more than 130 megawatts online in 2027 with substantial expansion potential beyond that.

Together, these transactions increase the total platform capacity to over 1 GW, firmly positioning Lake Mariner and Cayuga as cornerstone assets for the future of AI infrastructure.

# BTC Mining Market Dynamics

The legacy cryptocurrency mining equipment market remains relatively small, valued at $4.89 billion in 2024, with a modest expected CAGR of 6% through 2029. This limited total addressable market confirms that WULF’s future valuation cannot be sustained or driven by the mining segment alone. Furthermore, the high power cost structure ($0.078/kWh) exacerbates the sensitivity of WULF’s self-mining operations to post-Halving reductions in block rewards and transaction fee volatility. To maintain viability in this segment, WULF must rely on continuous operational efficiency improvements, such as its currently superior fleet efficiency of 19.2 J/TH.

WULF’s positioning requires a nuanced competitive comparison, as it no longer competes solely against pure-play miners. In the mining segment, WULF is structurally disadvantaged on cost when compared to peers who operate in markets with highly subsidized power or robust demand response programs.

While peers like Riot Platforms focus on maximizing scale and energy credits in deregulated markets (achieving a low all-in power cost of 2.8c/kWh ), WULF’s focus is on vertical integration and securing premium HPC contracts. This strategic dichotomy provides WULF with a valuable competitive exit strategy: as HPC capacity expands (200+ MW by YE 2026) , the company can strategically phase out its lower-margin self-mining IT load, replacing volatile commodity revenue with high-margin contracted infrastructure revenue.

# HPC and AI Infrastructure Market

The demand trajectory for HPC and AI infrastructure is vastly steeper than that of the legacy cryptocurrency mining market. WULF’s commitment to sustainable, zero-carbon energy serves as a critical competitive differentiator, allowing them to capture the “Green Premium” required by hyperscale clients seeking to meet stringent ESG and compliance mandates.

The Google-backed Fluidstack transaction provides definitive external validation of WULF’s infrastructure quality. Google, as a hyper-scale cloud provider known for rigorous technical and financial due diligence, backstopping $3.2 billion of Fluidstack’s lease obligations is a powerful endorsement. This commitment confirms that WULF possesses the necessary engineering expertise and reliable power infrastructure to support the complex, demanding compute environment required for cutting-edge AI computation, justifying the targeted 85% NOI margins.

# Moat Durability Assessment

**Moat Component:** Vertical Integration & Energy Expertise

**Assessment:** Durable

**Rationale:** Management’s deep expertise in energy infrastructure allows WULF to design and build bespoke power assets ($8M-$10M/MW CAPEX) that pure-play miners or generic data center operators cannot easily replicate.

**Moat Component:** Contracted Cash Flow Quality

**Assessment:** Highly Durable

**Rationale:** Long-term, non-cancellable 10-year contracts with annual escalators provide predictable, high-margin revenue, insulating WULF from commodity volatility. The Google backstop adds superior credit quality to this revenue stream.

**Moat Component:** Location and Power Sourcing

**Assessment:** Moderate

**Rationale:** Securing rights to low-cost, zero-carbon power in key industrial locations like Lake Mariner (NY) is geographically restricted and acts as a significant barrier to entry once established.

# Growth Analysis

The foundation of future growth is the certainty provided by the contracted revenue. The $6.7 billion commitment over 10 years offers revenue visibility unparalleled among cryptocurrency mining peers. This annuity stream, backed by the credit quality of a hyperscale partner, is projected to yield approximately $570 million in annual Site NOI at the 85% margin target once the 360+ MW is fully online (expected year-end 2026).

The growth trajectory is dictated by three primary levers:

1. **HPC Deployment Acceleration (Primary Lever):** The successful and timely completion of the 360+ MW buildout by year-end 2026 is paramount. Success in meeting this ambitious timeline ensures immediate realization of the 85% NOI margin and justifies the transition to a higher infrastructure valuation multiple.
2. **Expansion Optionality (CB-5):** Fluidstack’s exclusivity on an additional 160 MW at Lake Mariner represents a significant, low-risk growth path. This opportunity converts physical site infrastructure and utility access rights into high-margin capacity without the immediate burden of high-cost land or site development. Monetizing this growth inventory would nearly double the company’s core contracted MW capacity.
3. **Optimization of BTC Mining Operations (Secondary Lever):** Continuous optimization efforts to reduce the currently high effective power cost ($0.078/kWh) —potentially through more favorable Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) or enhanced demand response participation—would increase cash flow in the secondary segment, providing residual liquidity for maintenance CAPEX or accelerated debt service.

# Risk Analysis

WULF remains susceptible to external financial shocks. The stock’s high historical Beta of 4.18 means market sentiment remains heavily influenced by Bitcoin price volatility until the contracted revenue fully dominates the financial profile (post-2027). Although the Google backstop secures the majority of the HPC financing, WULF must still access the capital markets to fund residual CAPEX, working capital, and potential future expansion capacity beyond the current contracts. Macroeconomic risks, including interest rate fluctuations and general regulatory changes in the digital asset space, persist.

The single most significant threat to the acquisition value is execution failure. The requirement to deploy $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion in CAPEX and bring 360+ MW online by year-end 2026 represents an aggressive operational timeline. Delays or significant cost overruns could breach contractual obligations and severely erode the projected 85% NOI margin. Furthermore, sourcing specialized components for HPC infrastructure at this scale introduces supply chain and logistical risks, although management’s energy infrastructure track record provides substantial mitigation.

It must be noted that while the initial debt load will be high the highly predictable $570 million in annual NOI ensures an exceptionally rapid de-leveraging timeline. This characteristic fundamentally lowers the credit risk associated with the high capital investment, making the resultant capital structure considerably safer than traditional Bitcoin mining debt.

# Financials

In the 2025, WULF self mined 485 Bitcoin at Lake Mariner or approximately 5 Bitcoin per day, a 30% increase over the 372 Bitcoin mined in Q1 2025. TheirGAAP revenues were up 38% quarter over quarter at $47.6 million in Q2 2025 from $34.4 million in Q1 2025. Meanwhile their GAAP cost of revenue exclusive of depreciation decreased by 10% from $24.5 million in Q1 2025 to $22.1 million in Q2 2025.

Power prices in Upstate New York normalized in Q2 2025 and they expect pricing to remain in line with historical levels for the rest of 2025 guiding at $0.05 per kilowatt hour for second half of the year. SG&A expense for Q2 2025 was $14.3 million after adjusting for stock based compensation SG&A decreased QoQ from $11.5 million in Q1 2025 to $10.7 million in Q2 2025. Their non GAAP adjusted EBITDA showed significant improvement in Q2 2025 totaling $14.5 million up from a negative $4.7 million in Q1 2025. As a reminder, these results are inclusive of significant increases in SG&A and operating expenses over the past twelve months as they invested heavily in the HPC business. These incremental costs have been entirely borne by the mining business until now.

WULF is on track for the Wolf Den and CB1 leases with Core42 to start generating revenue in Q3 2025. They remain on schedule and on budget for the delivery of this capacity. Looking ahead to the 2025, they’ve updated their guidance in on the investor presentations. At current BTC prices and network hash rate, they expect the mining operations to contribute positively to EBITDA in the second half of the year. They’ve also slightly adjusted the annual SG&A guidance to $50 - $55 million from $40 - $45 million reflecting the accelerated growth in theHPC business.

WULF is planning to raise $3 billion in debt for the expansion of its’ AI infrastructure. The CEO is working with Morgan Stanley to arrange the funding. This could be launched as early as next month thorugh high yield bonds or leveraged loans.",0,0,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ntah2s/environmentally_friendly_bitcoin_miner_pivoting/,new,Stock Analysis,0.25

1nt1y65,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 18:43:21,CATERPILLAR [Post 2/4],"*This is the second post of a serie of at least 4 posts on mining/construction equipment. The first post was on* [*Epiroc*](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ni0qk3/epiroc_swedish_mining_equipment_serial_acquirer/) 

Caterpillar is a manufacturer of mining equipment, construction equipment, gaz turbines and marine & rail equipment. It was founded in 1925.

  
The company sales are geographically diversified, eventhough the majority of them are made in north america.

**Asset Allocation**

In average the company distributes 35% of its earnings as dividends. 

In the last 6 years, the company used close to 60% of its earnings in net buybacks. The reduction of outstanging shares was about 3% per year during that period.

The equity ratio is about 20% in average.

The company made acquisitions over the years. Most of the acquisitions are now made in the Energy & Transportation Group. 

\* They bought lots of add-ons to their Rail Division (Progress Rail), originally bought in 2006.

\* They bought gaz-engine manufacturer MVM in 2011 for 774 M$

\* One add-on for Solar Turbines in 2015.



The last acquisitions outside that group are :

\* Bucyrus for 8.8 B$ in 2011. Most of the distribution businesses for Bucyrus have been resold to existing Caterpillar distributor in 2012-2014 for a total of more than 2 B$.

\* one Japanese distributor for 200 M$ in 2012

\* one chinese company bought for 677 M$ in 2012. The next year, they depreciated 580 M$ of goodwill, because of fake accounting numbers produced before the acquisitions !?! They signed a deal to get 135 M$ back from the guilty parties

  
**Shareholders, Management & Board**

The company doesn't have main shareholders.

The new CEO Joe Creed was named in may 2025, but has been in the group since 1997. He was named CFO of the largest group (Energy & Transportation) in 2013. He then managed the financial services division in addition to interim CFO of Caterpillar. He then managed two divisions of the Energy & Transportation Group. He was named group president of Energy & Transportation in 2021, then COO (as in : successor of the CEO) in 2023. 

Ex-CEO Jim Umleby (17-25) stayed as chairman. 

Jason Kaiser, successor as group president of Energy & Transportation has been in the group since 2000. 

Bob de Lange, group president Digital, Technology & Distribution has been in his position since 2018 and joined Caterpillar in 1993.

Toni Fassino, group president Construction Industries has been named in 2021, but joined the group in 1996. He was previously head of the Building Construction Products Division (part of the Construction Industries group) from 2018.

Denise Johnson has been named group president of Ressources industries in 2016. She works for Caterpillar since 2011.

Generally speaking, there is some continuity in the management and the board. I see it as a green flag.



**Some numbers**

The profitability is going up, but have been low sometimes. The company made losses in 2016. Then the profitability was : 1.66% (17), 11.23% (18), 11.33% (19), 7.18% (20%), 12.73% (21), 11.28% (22), 15.41% (23), 16.65% (24). 

We can see that the company is quite cyclical. They don't seem to have as much recurring revenues as Epiroc.

The problem is that the company is generating sales and revenues of financial products that are only equivalent to about 70% of their balance sheet. They don't make a lot of money on the total assets, except in 2023-2024. One small factor might be that their rental activities includes a lot of equipment that is not from the group, including for example compressors from Atlas Copco. Usually, owning equipment to rent is a bad business, especially if it is not your products.  


**Conclusion**

The company has definitely not been exceptionally good before 2023, especially if you compare with Epiroc. I would not buy it, unless they were able to keep their numbers as good as 2023-2024, which I doubt they can. Their high level of buybacks could destroy value rapidly if the price was more expensive. Behind this high level of dividend and buybacks hides a limited capacity to make acquisitions.",4,1,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nt1y65/caterpillar_post_24/,new,Stock Analysis,0.84

3. KAP.IL - largest uranium extractor, with lowest uranium extraction cost. They are going through company restructuring and trading at PE of 11. Pays huge dividend as well. 

4. BN - just because this looks like a very diversified bet in one stock. PE is craz
crazy high but only because of the complex hierarchical structure of the corporation.

I think the quantitative side is more on the price you buy at, no matter how poor of value, if bought at the right price can return value, just has to be bought at the right price, like Howard Marks has continuously mentioned in his memo. Quantitative memos such as the P/E and P/B ratios, and of course, the DCF related to the intrinsic value, I like to have three different sets of growth, from a bear, to moderate, to a bull.

1nsremh,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 11:36:53,Im 15 and I’m trying to create a software to help value investors,"Hey everyone, I’m a 15 year old entrepreneur and I learned the craft of value investing when I was 12 and read books such as the intelligent investor and security analysis.

Recently I’ve gotten interested to create a saas (software as a service) business because I can’t turn 1k into 1 million dollars investing, the only way I can is through creating a business. I would really appreciate it if you guys would comment some pain points that I could possibly build a software to solve for.

I got an idea to create an intrinsic value editor that allows users to calculate the fair value of a company’s stock by entering key inputs such as free cash flow, growth rate, and discount rate as well as many metrics from the financial statements. The editor automatically applies the intrinsic value formula and displays the results in real time. You can also set up if statements within the tool, for example, “if the intrinsic value is higher than the current market price, display a message that the stock is undervalued.” In addition, you can configure alerts so that when certain conditions are met — like a stock becoming 20% undervalued — the tool notifies you instantly. This makes the editor not only a calculator, but also a decision-support system for smarter investing.

Also I was thinking about creating a software with AI included but I’m not sure which pain points it would solve. I would appreciate any honest feedBack!",0,14,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nsremh/im_15_and_im_trying_to_create_a_software_to_help/,new,Discussion,0.35

Sometimes of course this is true. Bad management, stupid ideas, and new management can fix it.

But it's also the case that a company could have once been great because of luck, factors out of their control, how the world was in that time that it allowed them to thrive.

For example: Disney. Disney got big by being THE company for family entertainment. In an era when making movies had a high cost barrier to entry. When publicity depended on being connected to media, rather than word of mouth. As movie technology was constantly changing. And those things no longer exist. Might Disney return? Maybe, but you can't assume an automatic spring back because the world that made them a titan no longer exists.

Or Intel. This is constantly mentioned on here, but everyone seems to forget they got huge because IBM picked them for their PC and when that opened up and we got Dell and HP clones, they all used an Intel chip. You wanted Windows, you had to go Intel. Gradually, PCs have flattened in terms of sales, ARM won the phone market and it growing into other areas like Macs, servers and Windows on ARM. Then there's RISC-V in China to consider. The US government scaring China about getting chips led to them investing more in their own technology.

None of this is to say there isn't a way back, but ""was big"" can cloud your judgement. Understanding why they are now smaller is really important.",7,4,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nso3s7/make_company_great_again/,new,Stock Analysis,1.0

This must be your first question. Too often, also in this subreddit, I see recommendations of highly valued trending stocks. Especially for tech businesses, it is unpredictable what the future will bring.

Therefore, I would like to share some less popular stocks that you also might consider as a long term investor:

* Azelis Group (AZE), a Belgian company. A serial acquirer of companies in special chemicals distribution. In my opinion, highly undervalued.
* FastNed BV (FAST), a Dutch charging station company. This relative new company is still cash flow negative, but the potential is huge. I like their story. Probably in two or three years cash flow positive.
* Fugro (FUR), geotechnical and geoscience services. This company had a lot of headwinds in 2025 due to cancelled oil/gas/wind projects. The investor sentiment is at it lowest... Still, their balance sheet looks ok. And long term, I think these projects will still continue. Now it is Trump in the white house, but one way or the other, the global energy transition (from oil to renewable energy) is going to happen.

As title states, **is salesforce undervalued at current period?** Is there any other lens I should be considering with this company? I can't upload images so I'll upload my excel spreadsheet findings so far. Bonus points if you have a link for an outstanding stock pitch ppt lol. 

For price forecasting, myself and many other investment funds forecast prices to be atleast $300 in the next 12 months implying a 23% for a neutral scenario. These prices used a DCF model and forecasting EPS/PE ratios

>***Salesforce sentiment***

1. Company layoffs early 2024 followed shortly by a revenue miss in Q1
2. Quarterly growth isn't as high as it used to be
3. Ai growth hasn't been as quick as expected
4. Skeptiscim about how ai will neagtively impact the business
5. The lower future growth output is causing PE contraction 

>***Salesforce growth catalyst***

1. Financial metrics are increasing to ATH (net/gross margins, FCF/Share, EBITA)
2. The revenue growth was from acquisition (not organic high margin growth), so a slow down in revenue from no further acquisitions make sense
3. Ratios are at near ATL (P/S, P/E, P/FCF)
4. Massive investment into AI development . Suggested 120% YoY growth in Data Cloud + AI ARR. the company said that over 40% of Data Cloud and Agentforce Q2 bookings came from existing customer expansion. This suggests that customers are finding significant value in the company’s AI and data offering and are willing to deepen their relationships with the company.
5. Q2 2025 announced a further $20B in share buy backs, brining the total to $50B of authorized share buy backs. Close to 1/4 of the companies mark cap in buybacks alone
6. On [help.salesforce.com](http://help.salesforce.com), Agentforce handled 380,000 conversations with 84% resolution; only \~2% required human escalation.

>***Bringing it together*** 

Salesforce is growing revenues at a modest rate of 8-9% net profit margins have increased 12% YoY, implying the business is becoming more efficient. 

Operating cash flow is growing at 12-13% YoY Full year guidance indicate EPS beats from $11.31 to $11.37 This net margin growth is expected to stay in double digits as Agentforce continues to rapidly grow in the next 2-3 years, growing the companies operating margins from 33% to 35/38% range. 

The business data suggests the moat is strong and growth is in line with markets, however the company is becoming more efficient increasing net cash/fcf positions With these extra profits, the company is doing mass buybacks Despite this, the P/S, P/E, P/FCF are near all time lows, dragging the stock price from of a high of $369 to $243.43 

*The markets seem to be looking through the wrong lens when approaching a thesis on salesforce.*  
Company presents a strong moat, high net margin growth with attractive price valuations and irresistible per share metrics through buybacks

1nsinid,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 03:59:44,Is Intel making a mistake?,"Full disclosure I have been interested in intel stock for a couple months now. Ever since the government took a 10% share in intel. I have been planning to invest 25k into the company but have not been liquid enough to do it just yet. 

I think intel despite its failings has a genuinely strong thesis. It’s the best US based foundry capable of producing microchips. With Chinas looming attack of Taiwan it is imperative for the U.S to have an answer for microchip production. China doesn’t have to actually take Taiwan to disable chip production , the process of making chips is so fragile that airburst from artillery could disrupt it. Microchips are core to Americas military , if TSMC is disabled we would see American military strength significantly weaken due to our weapons becoming difficult to replace and rearm. Intels success is literally a matter of national security.

That being said Intel currently is a gutted company on the verge of collapse with only a few small signs of hope such as the NVDA investment.

All of this being said I am not currently comfortable investing in Intel. Intel has seen a major increase in share price over the last couple weeks at a rate that seems detached from reality. Yes it has seen some minor wins but most of the gains are based on hype. “Intel in talks with TSMC” type of thing that doesn’t speak to the companies fundamentals. More so the stock has become a pseudo meme stock. 

I think this could be detrimental to the stock in the long run. If Intel stock keeps running up based on hype I think we will see a major retraction in the price in correlation with a market event. This type of fall will stunt intel’s long term growth due to investor fear of a repeat. Maybe even killing the company in the process. 

The question that I have is does my analysis make sense? I am still on the fence about investing in the company right now. I want to know if I should wait for the market correction or invest asap.

1nshls6,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 02:52:33,Freeport McMoRan Accident and Valuation,"Last week Freeport stock dropped more than 20% due to an accident in their Grasberg mine in indonesia. While I do understand the implications (2026,2027 lower production) are negative for the company, I don’t see why the stock dropped by so much. 

1) Usually mining (and oil) companies are valued with respect to their reserves and their cost to produce these reserves. So something like Reserves x (Commodity selling Price - Break Even Commodity Price). The accident at their mine will not change their reserves there. Of course there will be some extra costs which can be reflected in the Break Even Commodity Price of the Company (it will be increased), but I cannot believe it to be so high, that it justifies the drop we saw last week.

2) Copper Markets. No matter which source you take (BHP report, IEA Report), until 2050 there will be a massive undersupply of copper. The main reasons are declining ore head grades, almost no new discoveries and new permissions for mines takes ages (e.g. Resolution Copper for Rio and BHP is now more than 25 years in the permitting process). So if there is some supply demand imbalance here, prices are likely to rise (gold-copper-ratio also suggest that but it is not based on fundamentals). This is now somewhat of a paradoxon. When Freeport cannot pull out their copper out of the ground now, but only later when prices are (imo) much higher, and then Freeport has even higher ore Grades in 2-3 years, they make much more money than, than they lose know (OK, I do understand that there is uncertainty about that and you need to discount the future and such, but this is like a 20% risk discount which I think is irrational).

3)According to Goldman Analyst (I think it was them, but I could be wrong), due to this accident the copper supply decreased by 3% and now the world switched for a surplus to a deficit of copper. In the Barrons article it was written, that the same absolut amount of dollar which were lost in freeports market cap were gained in the market caps of BHP Rio and Glencore (because they are the largest copper producers) and will gain market share. Now, when in 2-3 years this mine comes online again with its 3% worldwide production rate (assuming everything else stays the same, I don’t think there will be more copper so the market share will be at least 3%, most likely more, see 1)). This market cap switch should be reversed, so Freeport will gain the market share it lost again.

Possible returns: 

While mining is not the classical Buffett and Munger play, I do think this is a value opportunity with a great entry point now. Copper is finite and demand will outstrip supply in the coming decades. After a drop of 20%, you will need a gain of 25%, so just waiting for Freeport to make their mine run again in the next 3 years, will give you 25% return over a period of 3 years. 

Of course I looked much more deeply in their annual reports and such but I don’t think it is relevant for this investment case. I will just say, they have 23 million ounces of gold at 1600$, and 97 billion pounds of copper at 3.25$/lb. So just looking at market prices of copper and gold right now, and making the math I described in 1), gives you the long term outlook. 

Looking forward to a discussion.

1nsfi0z,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 00:44:16,Why CSU (Constellation Software) is not a buy.,"Hey all,

I am aware of the buzz around the significant drop in CSU's stock price following the management transition from Mark Leonard to Mark Miller. While I find the market's overreaction silly, it is nothing unexpected, i am assuming the same will happen when Buffett steps down as well.

I believe the drop has been around 12 - 17% following the news. That is not a great margin of safety for a rational value investor. Also, looking at the FCF PE is still inflated, to say the least. Moreover, the actual P/E ratio is useless because they throw away so much more cash than they earn. Hence, the cash flow statement is crucial for such asset-heavy companies.

Overall i being someone who has read years of leanoards letters to shareholders, is sad to see him go, and i am sure managament that will assume roles will do fine, i do not think there is a serious margin of safety to buy, because price is a crucial factor, the underlying business is fine, but is not great, and considerng the heavy reliance on management's ability to allocate capital, unless the margin of safety is between 30 - 40%, i just cannot justify a buy.

Thanks.

Just wanted to add when I was referring to the margin of safety i meant the intrinsic value based of future earning powers while i belive most people are buying because of the 20 percent drop following the news.

1nsd54h,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 22:36:03,One of the best performing tech stocks of all time is on sale. And it’s not the Mag 7. Or even in the US.,"Constellation Software ($CSU.TO / $CNSWF) is experiencing a rare drawdown, in fact, the largest drawdown since IPO back in 2006. The founder, Mark Leonard, has been known as Canadas Warren Buffet, and is touted as one of the greatest capital allocators of all time. His shareholder letters are of renowned status, and anyone who has done any amount of research into the company knows the management quality is unparalleled. 

Constellation Software's compounding returns have quietly outshone almost every other stock since its IPO, cementing its place as one of the all-time great performers, all without being a member of the ""Magnificent Seven."" The company's unique, decentralized, long-term acquisition strategy for mission-critical vertical market software has created a fortress of recurring revenue. The services provided are known by shareholders to be sticky and switching costs are high. The company maintains relationships with potential acquisitions and holds a record of over 50,000 companies to potentially acquire. Since IPO, only one company has ever been re-sold, and Mark Leonard says this was one of his biggest regrets. 

I believe recent drawdown is entirely overblown. Skepticism over the impact of AI on its vast portfolio neglects Constellation's deep, embedded and entrenched specialized knowledge and systems in niche customer workflows—an enduring advantage against generalized AI tools. Furthermore, the stock's plunge following founder Mark Leonard's resignation for health reasons, though understandable given his legendary status, discounts the company's established, deep management bench and decentralized acquisition structure, which was built for perpetual operation beyond any single individual. The long-term thesis remains firmly intact. Mark Miller, the new CEO, himself has over 30 years with the company, leaving little doubt to his performance capabilities. 

The company typically commands a high premium, usually at 35-40x forward FCF. However, with last weeks intense sell off, the 2026E FCF multiple is currently in the low to mid 20s. I think this presents a very compelling opportunity for a company that has historically compounded at 20-30%. 

I believe this is a very rare buying opportunity. Next week, Constellation is holding a meeting to discuss the recent resignation of Mark Leonard. Volatility will likely remain high. I currently own 52 shares and will consider adding more in this dip.


**EDIT:**

Added below is one of the comments I made regarding what I believe is the root issue with the AI bear thesis - 

This is where the core issue of the AI arguement is: VMS will only lose value if they lose their customers.

I'm highly doubtful that artificial intelligence, any time in the near future, will upend and displace niche mission critical vertical market softwares. Typically, the cost of these vertical market softwares as a proportion of revenue generated from the business is one percent or less. There's no way that a municipality, utility, government agency or a healthcare facility (all common customers of CSU) will suddenly want to exchange deeply embedded VMS software for a new random vibe coded artificial intelligence mess, which will be riddled with bugs, issues, errors and inefficienceis. CSU's softwares have over the years been custom tailored and designed for each specific industry and business. Further, while AI has been shown to be decent at generating new code for simple programs, it's quite bad at debugging and fixing issues and errors. Like one commentor put it, good for greenfield, bad for brownfield. 

Imagine having to retrain hundreds of employees on how to use a new software that's been used by the business for the last fifteen to twenty years. Then fix all the new bugs, issues and inefficiencies on top of that. And remember when I said, the expense for this software is <1% of their revenue? Are they going to go through this headache? No.

Real world example - I work as a physical therapist with a home health agency. We still use a software on our company mobile devices called ""HomeCare HomeBase"" that was made for Blackberries with a keyboard and stylus for use by nurses 15 years ago. We still use it today and it's still one of the largest home health softwares used by home health agencies in the US. It's the same concept. For these businesses, switching out the software is just not worth the disruption in business operations for at best a minor operational efficiency improvement and practially no cost savings.

Also, on top of all that, consider the opposite approach with AI for CSU. Wouldn't one stand to reason that with all the proprietary data and relationships CSU has with its customers, they would actually be primed to take advantage of the AI wave and improve their own software thats already in use by their customers? That's the other way to look at AI.",322,189,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nsd54h/one_of_the_best_performing_tech_stocks_of_all/,new,Stock Analysis,0.89

1ns6vo5,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 17:28:52,A few words on the mining industry: valuing companies should be done differently.,"I think there is a core crowd here who do value investing the old fashioned way. We determine a cohort of companies, try to place a value each of them using a minimum number of assumptions, and try to identify outliers that are trading far below fair value AND have a robust future in terms of earnings forecast.

I personally work in the minerals exploration industry and spend most of my time evaluating projects there (geologically) but once in a while I do make investment decisions. I don't think I beat the market by a significant margin. But it struck me a few weeks ago that the approach I take is totally different from the normal companies on the stock market so I share it here with the aim of getting feedback.

So target cohort I'll cover here are pre-discover exploration companies. Also called ""Juniors"". They are looking for metals in various parts of the world but have effectively no assets and are pre-revenue. Somewhat comparable to startups in the tech space. But given it takes many years to develop a mine, they are likely 20+ years away from revenue because they haven't even found any metal. This is where most investors encounter the minerals industry.

Valuation at this stage relies less on financial models and more on comparables and ""optionality"" (what could they do in the near future). We look at the cost per square kilometre of land held under exploration license, or the enterprise value relative to metres drilled, as a way to anchor expectations. Others attempt a probability-weighted “real option” approach, where you assign a very small chance of discovery leading to eventual production. But in practice, the market often values these companies more on a story, management credibility, and “hot money” flows into certain commodities. Today those are things like Gold, Antimony, Tungsten, Copper, REE, maybe Uranium.

The failure risk is enormous: the geological odds of success are estimated at 1 in 2000, funding is episodic and dilutive, and the time to potential cash flow is measured in decades. And many teams are dysfunctional.

The key parameter we use is Enterprise Value (EV). In short: cash plus debt. All the money that has been poured into the business (not all of it effectively, and a majority often simply into salaries). Let me show what I do with some examples:

Lets say there are two companies, both with $5M cash (all numbers USD). A typical amount after their first raise on the stock market.

Company A is an Explorer in a conventional, proven location (like the Laramide Porphyry Belt in SW USA):

-100 km² license package.
-Located in the Laramide Copper Belt (Arizona/Mexico), proven endowment, world-class neighbors already in production.
-Good infrastructure, mining-friendly jurisdiction.

Company B is a ""Blue Sky"" Frontier Explorer, way up in Nunavut or Northern Namibia (jurisdiction OK, but not a known belt):
-1000 km² license package.
-Located in a frontier jurisdiction (e.g., parts of Africa or Central Asia) with little proven copper endowment.
-Poor infrastructure, higher jurisdiction risk. Some opaque legislation makes it hard to model outcomes for a foreign actor.

In proven belts, especially for Cu or Au, we would use a land value of 200k-500k per sqkm. So company A is valued at $20-50M plus cash = max $55M.

Company B in an unproven belt basically has moose pasture. We heavily discount the probability of them finding a deposit, even if they are assumed to be competent. Lets say 10% as good as the Laramide. So 20-50k per sqkm.

10 times the ground position gives them max $50M, plus cash = $55M.

Many many juniors stall at this $50M market cap. Its among the most popular valuation. And therefore we should be very careful with investing at this valuation. $10M in a debt-free, recently starting company with similar land position is a good ""value"" entry point, exit at $40M or before they run out of money. Because once exploration stalls, the lack of a discovery starts to crystallise into the reality.

The second way we value is using an adjusted NAV (asset value of future discovery, discounted by the likelihood of actually finding it). Like trying to value a lottery ticket based on the size of the prize.

Let’s assume a “discovery” in the Laramide belt could eventually become a 200Mt @ 0.5% Cu deposit, with a net project NPV of ~$2B once built.

I mentioned industry statistics suggest the probability of a grassroots explorer making a discovery that reaches production is about 1 in 2000.

But in the Laramide Belt, odds may improve to 1 in 200–300 given proven fertility, leveraging existing historic work, and proximity to infrastructure (lowering the threshold for something being economic).

In a frontier region, odds may be worse, say still at 1 in 2000.

Company A (Laramide):
-0.5% chance (1/200) × $2B NPV = $10M expected value.

Add cash on hand (EV): $5M = ~$15M equity value.

Market might still pay a premium for attractive metal like Cu/press narrative/management = $20–30M cap.

Company B (Frontier):
-0.05% chance (1/2000) × $2B = $1M expected value.

Add cash: $5M → ~$6M equity value.

Market perception might lift to $10–15M if commodity (e.g., copper) is hot.

This is why I would say the mid-point $40M is an excellent exit point for a given position on a safe bet exploration play. Track record of the board is often earning a small premium but in my opinion its largely anecdotal and ALL companies try to inflate their credit to hit this extra premium.

So who is at this level already? Alta Copper TSX:ATCU (drilling out a resource but authorisation obstacles), Group11 (probably overvalued), Hannan Metals (way overvalued given their assets), District Metals (also way overvalued).

Who is close? Atico CVE:ATY (actually they have a short-life resource so probably undervalued), Havilah Resources (almost 1Mt Cu plus gold in the ground, 70% undervalued I would say), Max resources (using average of EV and NAV as above).

Who is way below: Anglesey Mining AYM.L (historic mine, small land position, jurisdiction has legislative risks), Firefox gold (lack of any real discovery), Eurobattery Minerals (I think their ground is terrible).

Anyway think about this when evaluating early stage exploration juniors. There is a lot of noise on this forum about juniors and its really easy to value them.

If there is interest I will post something on strategic metals because they might allow us to add extra value due to ""offtake interest"", or tax incentive from the jurisdiction on a future discovery.

1ns5fjr,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 16:27:49,Overpriced Equity Market Bonds & Other Safe Assets,"One thing I learned quite hard way is not try to predict the market. However, the current equity market is at all time highs and prices look quite expensive except few stocks which got hammered down.

From this perspective, I am thinking whether it makes sense to start moving money to bonds. I had been doing small investments in bond market from last year however it is becoming increasingly hard to beat inflation after the returns.

2024 Bond market really came down and I am thinking with an equity crash whether we will see lower interest rate again. However, I can see what could happen with government debt being so high and they could repeat what they did in 1945.

""1945 financial repression"" refers to the period following World War II when many governments, including the United States, implemented financial repression policies to manage their high debt loads. These policies included artificially keeping interest rates low and controlling financial institutions to reduce the real value of their accumulated government debt and lower debt-to-GDP ratios. 

**Key characteristics of financial repression after 1945:**

* **Low Interest Rates:** Governments set interest rates at artificially low levels, often below the rate of inflation, to make their debt cheaper to service. 
* **Government Control:** Authorities often controlled the financial sector, directing capital and limiting financial choices to ensure government debt was held and that funds were available for public investment. 
* **Debt Management:** The primary goal was to reduce the burden of war-related debt, which was as high as 100% of GDP for some nations in 1945. 
* [**Liquidation**](https://www.google.com/search?cs=0&sca_esv=fe0550819d8f48a0&sxsrf=AE3TifObF5u0NPdhgBJxFHFY-DAM6Kj92g%3A1759004713747&q=Liquidation&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjksOGY4_mPAxW9T6QEHfIxAR4QxccNegQIDhAB&mstk=AUtExfCKxmEa5io003LXQvDvn6s5Ds91RdDLKbDc81Ze5vtNs2hVxSCN3UGoiv4XBBBSwYxre-TFvMh5lEWFyL76MmTOItadNveCyw1wNwSLXmFgwftSDAUgWDI94PGrnAgd2LXuiUotq9vOOTuLHHz9HXJGAvJElEX49LPf33941jXVtac&csui=3) **of Debt:** By keeping real interest rates negative, governments effectively ""liquidated"" their debt, meaning the real value of the money owed to bondholders decreased over time

It looks a bit more scarier than a 2008 because both equity and bond markets look riskier. Gold would have been an option but you cannot be 100% gold in a portfolio and Gold is at all time high.

Would like everyone's views or hypothesis and may be a good strategy can be carved.

Update Here is what Claude AI said on this. Worth reading.

""Based on current evidence, here are the key indicators that suggest the US government may be preparing for or moving toward financial repression policies:

# Direct Policy Indicators

# 1. Debt Management Crisis

The debt limit was reinstated at $36.1 trillion on January 2, 2025, representing the total amount of outstanding debt. The Treasury is already using extraordinary measures, including tapping civil service and postal retirement funds to meet federal obligations. This shows the government is under significant debt pressure.

# 2. Interest Rate Suppression Mechanisms

Markets are pricing in continued Fed rate cuts, with 89% probability of another 0.25% cut at the October 2025 meeting and high odds of additional December cuts. This suggests policy makers are committed to keeping rates low despite potential inflationary pressures.

# 3. Yield Curve Control Discussion

Under yield curve control (YCC), the Fed would target longer-term rates and pledge to buy enough long-term bonds to keep rates from rising above target. While not yet implemented, countries are actively using YCC policies in real time, suggesting this tool is being seriously considered.

# Structural Economic Indicators

# 4. Debt Servicing Pressure

The rise of net debt cost-to-government-revenues ratio is expected to slow in 2025, partly because short-term yields have declined, somewhat narrowing the yield gap between maturing and new bonds. This shows the government is acutely aware of debt servicing costs and benefits from suppressed rates.

# 5. Institutional Framework Changes

In December 2024, GAO recommended that Congress consider immediately replacing the debt limit with an approach that links debt decisions to spending and revenue decisions. This could remove debt ceiling constraints that currently limit the government's ability to implement financial repression.

# Historical Context

Financial repression policies involve measures that enable governments to place debt with financial institutions at ""artificially low interest rates,"" and it wasn't just the US that used this method historically. Financial repression is intended to help governments deleverage over time by artificially lowering yields on government bonds.

# Key Warning Signs to Monitor:

**Immediate Indicators:**

* Implementation of yield curve control by the Federal Reserve
* Regulatory pressure on banks to hold more government bonds
* Capital controls or restrictions on international investments
* Negative real interest rates becoming persistent policy

**Policy Rhetoric:**

* Emphasis on ""financial stability"" over market-determined rates
* Discussion of making the financial system serve ""national priorities""
* Increased regulation of pension funds and insurance companies

**Market Behavior:**

* Unusual Treasury auction dynamics or direct Fed intervention
* Persistent yield curve suppression despite inflation
* Regulatory changes that effectively force institutions to hold government debt

The current situation shows many preconditions for financial repression are present: high debt levels, political pressure to keep borrowing costs low, and central bank tools that can suppress longer-term rates. While not yet fully implemented, the infrastructure and justifications for such policies are being established.""",0,1,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ns5fjr/overpriced_equity_market_bonds_other_safe_assets/,new,Question / Help,0.25

However, if you look closely into Waste Management (WM), it is one of the most durable compounding machines in the U.S. economy. On the surface, it looks like basic trash collection, landfill ownership, and recycling. But under the surface is an almost impossible moat to replicate:

High barriers to entry - New landfills are extraordinarily difficult to permit, regulate, and finance. The existing network of WM is an irreplaceable asset.

Pricing power with inflation pass-through - Many contracts allow them to alter rates automatically, while still protecting margins.

Capital allocation discipline - WM will consistently return free cash flow via dividends and buybacks, but continues to reinvest to become more efficient.

This is a business that thrives in the background of daily life. While investors are lining up stocks for the next tech disruptor, Waste Management is compounding wealth by managing something that society literally cannot live without.

They represent the same underlying company (Ørsted).

So what could explain such a discrepancy? Some hypotheses I have:

- Timing / delay in market adjustments across jurisdictions

- FX (USD/EUR) translation effects

- Low liquidity or order book depth in the ADR market

Has anyone seen similar behavior with ADRs vs home listings? Or have insight into how Ørsted’s ADR / D2G mechanics might contribute to this?

50% reduction in share price this year.
PE at 11. Usually at 20.
Analyst ratings broadly positive. 
4.5% dividend

Moats include:
Very strong brand recognition. Up there with McDs or Burger King in the UK. 

It's the most inexpensive option. I dont see weak consumer sentiment as an issue. I've traded down to it recently and it's always been heaving. There's nowhere else for the UK consumer to trade down to, other than complete behaviour change (prepping food at home). And that will be more than mitigated by the middle classes starting to eat there (see Aldi and Lidl) if things continue to worsen. 

All the headwinds around inflation and taxes on employees will also affect the competition and Greggs are well placed to survive this (see balance sheet) and eat up the spare demand when others fold. I also think there's some room for them to increase pricing a bit. £3 bacon roll and coffee could go higher and they would still outcompete the rest on price. Likewise the £5 lunch deal which is about half that of Subway (hardly a premium option!)

But maybe im missing something because they are being heavily shorted by hedge funds. What am I missing?

I have recently found Etoro in the market, did not even know they went public. It was my first trading app downloaded and used back in 2017. The App is heavily marketed towards beginners and it works, however, it is not the best for long term traders. 

The stock is currently heavily down, however, when i look at their financials, it tells me a different story.

For example on a yearly basis , Revenue up 225%, Gross profit up 41%, Their total assets up 48% with an increase in liabilities specifically accounts payable which increased 235% ( i assume from marketing).

Their cashflow statement is good as well, with an increase of 140% in cash from operating and a significant decrease in cash from investing, which means they are acquiring assets (which i like).

Their PE ratio is reasonable and not over priced like Robinhood. AI and analysts give this a strong buy, however the current market price says other wise.

Step I:

\- scrapes major subreddits like wsb valueinvesting etc. for all ticker mentions in the last 24 hours  
\- goes through openinsider to see any new cluster buys and notes the ticker  
\- goes through everything on dataroma to see if any superinvestor has bought anything recently

this gives us [step I spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sX6mbFIG7uiQxbCwPuF-tp2am5TspgLoEXmqwrAeAJ0/edit?gid=0#gid=0). Basically a list of interesting tickers to look at. Currently has 2320 entries and updated every day.

Step II:

\- filters out tickers that got there by mistake / wrong names / etfs etc.  
\- a deeper dive into things we like to see like insider buying, share reduction over the last year, superinvestors that are also in. Based on this it assigns each opportunity a score.  
\- people will say why not current ratio, rising revenue, etc. it is because these signals are often noisy and corrupt the data. Too many outliers and variations in financials

this gives us [step II spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sX6mbFIG7uiQxbCwPuF-tp2am5TspgLoEXmqwrAeAJ0/edit?gid=359346395#gid=359346395).

Step III:

\- we get ideas with the highest score based on step II  
\- the real fun begins we use the latest model of gemini to get the following  
\- business summary, company history, moat analysis  
\- management record, management incentives, catalyst analysis  
\- price history, bull thesis, assumptions baked in, bear scenario  
\- next steps to look at / questions to ask

The result is this sick [Step III spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sX6mbFIG7uiQxbCwPuF-tp2am5TspgLoEXmqwrAeAJ0/edit?gid=831501853#gid=831501853). Just take a look at how beautiful the analysis is. Gives you a solid basis to look at companies. New models are really good at getting info from the web so that's SEC filings, earnings calls, news, etc. so I cannot recommend it highly enough. I think valuation is a very personal thing which one should do themselves but qualitative analysis with the good and bad is a good starting point.

Step III script is slow because it calls the LLM for all these small qualitative things, but should eventually catch up with the previous ones.

# 1. 🔥 Reboot Spotlight to Rival TikTok

* **Algorithm Overhaul**: Invest in AI-driven personalization to boost content discovery and engagement.
* **Creator Monetization**: Launch a revenue-sharing model for creators to attract talent and viral content.
* **Social Commerce Integration**: Embed shopping features directly into Spotlight to tap into TikTok’s 43.8% conversion rate.

# 2. 💰 Monetize the AR Platform

* **License AR Tools**: Offer Snap’s AR tech to third-party apps, retailers, and advertisers.
* **Easy Lens Expansion**: Scale the AI-powered lens creation tool for brands and SMBs.
* **AR Commerce**: Enable virtual try-ons and interactive ads with direct purchase options.

# 3. 📈 Scale AI Advertising

* **Smart Campaign Suite**: Expand AI ad tools for SMBs to automate targeting and boost ROI.
* **Attention Metrics**: Promote Snap’s eye-tracking and media quality tools to advertisers for better performance tracking.
* **Sponsored Snaps & Promoted Places**: Package immersive ad formats for travel, retail, and entertainment brands.

# 4. 🧠 Streamline Operations

* **Cut Moonshots**: Pause or spin off hardware projects like Spectacles unless they show near-term ROI.
* **Lean Product Teams**: Consolidate overlapping features and reduce engineering overhead.
* **Focus on High-Margin Revenue**: Prioritize Snapchat+ and AR ad formats over low-margin brand ads.

# 5. 📊 Financial Discipline

* **Target Positive Free Cash Flow by Q4 2026**: Set aggressive cost controls and revenue benchmarks.
* **Debt Restructuring**: Address \~$1.5B net debt burden through refinancing or asset sales.
* **Quarterly Profitability Goals**: Tie executive compensation to operating income milestones.

# 6. 🌍 Expand Demographic Reach

* **Grow Beyond Gen Z**: Develop features for older users—family sharing, professional networking, and secure messaging.
* **Global Expansion**: Localize content and ad tools for emerging markets with high mobile penetration.

# 🧩 Bonus: Acquisition Contingency Plan

If Snap fails to hit profitability targets by 2027, prepare for strategic acquisition talks with:

* **Amazon** (for AR commerce)
* **Apple** (for camera tech)
* **Netflix** (for short-form content)

Snap’s tech is strong. Its user base is loyal. But without bold moves, it risks becoming a niche app with cool features and no future. This roadmap is about **scaling smart, monetizing hard, and cutting deep**.

* Some firms like Apple, Home Depot have done repurchases brilliantly, while others have destroyed billions.

-Operate in oligopolistic markets with high barriers to entry.

-Have recurring, sticky demand regardless of economic cycles.

-Generate significant free cash flow, which gets returned to shareholders or reinvested efficiently.

-Benefit from inflation pass-through in ways investors don’t always price in.

Reduce the overall volatility of my portfolio

Generate passive income

1nr7bir,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 13:21:56,It might be time to bet the farm on Constellation Software ($CSU.TO) and Topicus ($TOI.V),"Constellation Software is one of those ""if you know, you know"" companies. For those unaware, the founder and CEO Mark Leonard just stepped down as president of the company for health concerns. He will still remain director of the board, and current COO Mark Miller will assume the President role. 

This guy belongs in the same conversation as Warren Buffett for the capital allocation GOAT. Since the 2006 IPO, Constellation has returned ~35% per year, making it around a 200 bagger in 20 years. This didn't come from a single home run product like Google or Facebook, it was just 20 years of masterful capital deployment by acquiring vertical market software businesses.

I don't want to list out every financial performance metric here, but do yourself a favor and look up a 10 year chart for revenue and free cash flow per share. They keep the share count exactly the same, they don't have high debt levels, and they deploy nearly all of their free cash flow into new acquisitions. The performance is simply staggering, given the size. 

Well, after the news of Mark Leonard stepping down, shares of $CSU.TO are cratering. This is really surprising to me, as Leonard has made it a point to insist that the system that management has built doesn't rely on any single key figure, but more on a culture of excellence spread through a series of decentralized operating groups. Either way, I think the market is offering us a great discount on one of the best businesses in the world. 

Topicus ($TOI.V) is a spin off of one of the aforementioned operating groups, employing the same strategy as Constellation Software, but with faster growing companies based in Europe. Leonard is still on the board, and the Constellation DNA is very evident. They have deployed massive amounts of capital over the past year, and they are operating in a geography with much less competetive capital markets, resulting in comparatively attractive prices.

Both of these companies are now trading at EV/FCF ratios in the low to mid twenties. This is extremely reasonable, arguably cheap, for businesses of this level of quality.

The company plans to close 900 underperforming stores and reduce corporate jobs, with employees receiving support packages and benefit extensions. Savings from these cuts will be reinvested into store redesigns and innovations, with about $150,000 planned per location.

By fiscal 2026, Starbucks targets a 30% reduction in costs and will introduce a new standalone store design featuring 32 seats and a drive-thru. While these changes may help over time, the turnaround won’t be immediate. Higher menu prices from inflation and long wait times, made worse by online orders remain challenges for customer experience at a brand positioned as a quick-service restaurant.",1,1,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nr6ndg/starbucks_restructuring_plan/,new,Stock Analysis,1.0

* Relatively low PE ratio of 11.45 (per Google Finance).
* 3 Year Revenue CAGR of \~22%, but most recent quarter had negligible growth Y/Y.
* Margin improvement has been insane. In FY2024, they improved adjusted EBITDA margin from 11% to 22%. Most recent Quarter (Q2 2025), has adjusted EBIDTA margin of \~29%. Management has a goal of 35%, and they look on track to execute.
* Strategy focused on ads/monetization, enterprise, and AI. They seem to be executing well on all of these fronts, but the one I'm most excited about is enterprise. They've had some recent acquisitions and a new subsidiary set up to start focusing on these clients and enterprise staffing using their existing talent pool and platform just seems like a no-brainer. 

For me, the main thing to worry about is the drop on revenue growth, but at the current PE ratio, it's not really priced for strong growth anyways. It seems like an obvious buy based on the improvement of margins alone, but given the potential in Enterprise, I feel like there's reason to be optimistic about growth as well.

1nqzyr0,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 08:25:42,Is Google Stock a Still Bargain? 10-Year Return Expectations,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better.

However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it.

When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value.  
After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years.

From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500.

Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations.

Anyways here are the results:

FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR  
EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR  
Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR

So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price?  
Probably not.

Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs.

That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding.

Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels.

For me this is a clear hold.

If you want to look at the calculations for the model:

1nqzog9,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 08:11:15,Small portfolio value investing: focus on fundamentals over flashy trends,"Been thinking about the challenges we face as retail investors with smaller portfolios, especially when competing against institutional money. After watching countless retail investors chase meme stocks and AI hype over the past couple years, I keep coming back to the basics that actually work for our scale. The math is pretty straightforward: with less than $100K, every percentage point of loss hits harder, so protecting capital becomes even more critical than chasing the next big thing.

What's worked for me is sticking to companies with consistent earnings growth over 3-5 years, keeping debt-to-equity ratios below 0.5, and actually reading the financials instead of following social media buzz. Sure, it's boring compared to swing trading hot stocks, but compound growth from quality dividend payers has been way more reliable than trying to time market swings. The real edge we have over institutions is patience and the ability to hold positions without quarterly pressure from investors.

Anyone else finding that the fundamentals approach works better with smaller accounts?

Current contracts are for research purposes - again there is no current viable path to profits using quantum computers. 

The largest issue with quantum computers is the error rate. With a ~0.1% error rate per operation, as operations scale the results therefore become useless.

The stock is up 800% in the last year. This parabolic move without commensurate fundamental economic shift is synonymous with a bubble.

Can someone who knows more about this comment?,"With the whole health sector taking a pummeling in the past year (and admittedly, there still being a possibility of downward pressure during this presidential term), VRTX has taken quite a beating amidst regulatory hurdles.  Today's FDA designation for Vertex Kidney Disease drug is positive but I'm very intrigued by the process in which VRTX/CRSPR has begun to commercialize Casgevy.  It seems to be in the very early stages but seems to have a long-term potential for a large bump in revenue growth.  I guess it remains to be seen how profitable it can be but I imagine that will only improve with time over long term horizons.

I will fully admit that this sector is not something I'm very knowledgeable about but it seems to me if you're banking on CRSPR playing a huge role in the future of medical treatment, and with the rollout starting in recently, now would be a great time to invest in the company that stands to benefit the most from its success.  I've been following the CRSPR story for a while waiting for when ""hope becomes reality"" for its treatments and it seems that transition is occurring now.  Am I way off base here?

1nq9ft6,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 11:13:18,Thought on investing in Qualcomm (QCOM) over the long term: 20-40 years,"I’ve begun looking into QCOM these past few months .. was talking with a buddy who knows a good bit about semi-conductors, but not very much about investing. 

My buddy is a big fan of QCOM largely due to their patents and market share - according to him, nearly every single cell phone (Apple, android, and any other brands) use QCOM technology to make their phones, and those who do not use QCOM technology in their cellular devices, still owe a percentage of revenue/royalty to QCOM on sales due to QCOM’s 300,000+ patents surrounding wireless communication.

I love the sound of that, but obviously concerns regarding a monopoly arise in my mind. I’d like to gauge the sentiment of you all - is the fear of QCOM being labeled a monopoly and/or their patents being stripped away a major long-term concern?

QCOM has a solid 2% annual dividend yield, with a reasonable PE ratio of 16.5 - $10.3 billion in revenue last quarter and $2.7 billion in net income should mean they are roughly producing $40 billion in revenue annually, and making more than $10 billion in net income (25% + profit margins). 

I’ll obviously continue to look further into QCOM before making an investment, but like I said, want to hear the sentiment of you all. A company I would like to build an initial position in, turn on dividend reinvestments, and periodically add to the position over the next decade or two.

1nq8xah,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 10:53:52,5 Ways I Manage Risk in My Stock Portfolio,"As markets grind higher, I find more of my analyses and thinking erring on the side of caution. This is not a sell everything post. I just think it is worth revisiting not just how we make money but how we avoid losing too much of it. Admittedly, I am rereading Howard Marks remarks over time which may also be influencing my perspective.

Nevertheless, I wanted to share 5 things I wrote down and do to keep risk in check, specifically as it pertains to my stock portfolio:

1. I invest in quality stocks. By quality I am referring to stocks that have durable moats, strong balance sheets, and consistent profitability. Generally, these companies tend to fall less in downturns and recover faster.
2. I attempt to avoid overpaying for companies. This is because even great companies can be terrible investments at the wrong price. I use relative valuation as well as DCF analyses to find companies where the market's expectations are reasonable.
3. Diversification. Concentration seems to be a more acceptable avenue for portfolio construction these days. I am not knocking it, but I do not think that there is value in diversification to manage risk. I use ETFs to provide the foundation for my portfolio, while carrying individual positions that are built to about 5% of my portfolio. Yes. I let winners run.
4. Cash can offer incredible benefits. And there is nothing wrong with building cash positions when things appear stretched. Cash is not dead money anymore. Today, cash can earn 4-5% while also providing confidence when things get scary.
5. This one is not for everyone, but I selectively sell calls on positions that I perceive are overheated. Doing so generates income and trims risk. There are risks to this strategy, though.

To be clear, none of these eliminate losses. But taken together, the goal is to make downturns survivable and gives us the confidence to be opportunistic.

I elaborate in a bit more detail [here](https://arbalistmoney.com/5-ways-i-protect-my-stock-portfolio-from-risk/), if interested.

1nq8qsz,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 10:46:50,Short-term vs. long-term,"Lately, I’ve been struggling with the question of whether I should stick to a long-term investing strategy or try to take advantage of short-term opportunities, especially in the tech/AI sector.

On one hand, companies like NVIDIA, Amazon, and ASML have strong long-term potential and are part of big trends like AI and semiconductors. But on the other hand, valuations are stretched, and the market seems overheated in the short term.

Should I wait for a correction? Or keep dollar-cost averaging into strong names regardless of short-term price?

Both strategies have risks:

* Going short-term can lead to emotional decisions and timing mistakes.
* Going long-term might mean holding through big drawdowns, especially if a stock was overhyped.

How do you balance short-term market signals with long-term conviction?

1nq68sy,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 09:05:28,Help this poor soul understand stocks,"Hi all,

Recently, I’ve been buying stocks with a part of my salary every month. This makes saving money every month a lot easier (and more entertaining) for me. So far, I have Intel, United Healthcare, Energy Fuels Inc and Boeing stocks in my portfolio. Among these stocks, I wanted to hear your opinion about Boeing. 

Before I bought Boeing this week I had a silly notepad listing some of my reasons:

* US government backing
* Production of F-22 successor F-47
* Palantir collaboration
* Already has a high backlog of orders
* Started delivering to China-orders were halted since trade wars
* China expected to order up to 500 planes
* Turkish Airlines expected to order 250 planes (order is expected to go through today 09-25)

I recognize that it is definitely not the greatest company out there and is dealing with a lot of problems. However, from my perspective the company has a clear path for future growth. I believe the reasons I listed outweighs the company’s current problems. This is clearly not the case for most people and company is not attracting investors. 

As the absolute beginner here, I wanted to hear from you, why I’m wrong and the flaws of my logic.

1nq42p5,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 07:21:23,Portillos (PLTO,"** Ticker is PTLO **
(Couldn't see how to edit title?)

Opened new position yesterday at $6.36.

Synopsis:
- Fast casual chain based out of Chicago featuring Chicago favorites (Italian beef, hot dogs, Polish sausage, etc.) and standard fare (burgers, fries, etc.)
- IPO'd in 2021 at $20, quick run up to over $47, mainly declining since
- Market cap $477M
- Down 45% last 3 mos, 51% last year
- CEO since 2018 was termed this week, new CEO search now underway

Financials (a/o end 30 Jun):
- $727M revenue +3.62% growth
- 40.3% GP, 10.3% op margin, 4.8% net, 13.2 EBITDA
- Book value $6.38/share
- Debt to equity 1.29

Risks:
- Catching a falling knife?
- Same store sales pretty stagnant
- Growth slowing
- Popularity for Chicago style food outside Chicagoland and select transplant areas (e.g. FL, AZ) is not a given, especially given it is quite unhealthy and GLP1 use
- More capital intensive restaurant model than other fast casual competitors 

""So I have that going for me"":
- Still quite early in terms of national expansion possibilities - as of Nov last year, just 10 states and <100 stores (may have increased some since then)
- Fiercely loyal core fans of the food
- Lowering interest rates outlook benefits their debt situation
- Room to improve margins with more focus on efficiency and innovation
- Valuation on low end
- +2.2% price over the last week, which includes CEO change annlincement

Getting in now is a bit of a gamble I'll admit. Been on watchlist for awhile. Decided that the CEO change, pause in the falling price, and rate cuts are enough potential catalysts to stake an initial position (1% of trading account).

Disclaimer: I am Chicago native who likes the food but lives outside the area and wishes they'd expand to my state. 

Interested to hear other opinions.

1nppu6c,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 18:18:57,The Case for Amneal Pharmaceuticals (AMRX),"Got into Amneal at around $2 in late October of 2022 and am still holding after my 400%+ gain because I believe the stock still has room to grow significantly. JPM recently raised PTs to $14 and GS to $12 as the company begins to develop a significant foothold in the specialty and affordable medicines space. I believe the stock will continue to increase due to these 3 reasons:

1. AMRX trades at a discount to peers on EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples. If execution continues, re-rating toward peer multiples alone could justify $12–$15/share

2. Historically, Amneal was weighed down by debt post-merger. Stronger operating cash flow, refinancing (just completed this summer) at lower rates, and paydown efforts are improving the capital structure

3. The company has over 100 ANDAs pending, including complex generics that carry greater barriers to entry. Recent FDA approvals and launches (GLIADEL Wafer, biosimilars like Releuko and Fylnetra) show execution capability

and most importantly...

  
LEADERSHIP!!!

Amneal is co-led by two CEOs, Chirag and Chintu, who have an incredible grasp on the pharma space and have the entire company ""bought in"" on their mission. Amneal went public via a merger in 2018 and peaked at around $24 before crashing by over 90%. Chirag and Chintu, who were on the Board of Directors at the time, returned post-crash and began to assemble a new leadership team, which has resulted in significant growth over the last 5 years.

1npnv31,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 16:58:37,"How capitalism will collapse run away from money, run toward gold now","
There’s a huge job market crisis, the threat of AI, and people are scared of the future. What happens next? People afraid of what’s coming don’t want to hold money anymore they put it into safe assets. They buy gold. The dollar drops in value.

Yes, I think people should abandon the dollar the paper money that companies and the rich hoard. It’s useless in this economy. Hoard gold. Hoard real assets.

Companies keep generating profits, quarter after quarter, but they don’t hire people. They just grow richer and more independent from workers. But are they really? If being rich is measured by how many paper dollars you own, they can become poor overnight if people simply refuse to value paper money.

If 99% of the money belongs to the rich, then the poor should just stop using it. Leave paper money behind.

I read that 100 years ago, the amount of gold an average person could buy with their salary was much higher than today. That shows how worthless paper money has become.

So leave paper money and buy tangible assets gold, and others with real value. Companies can multiply paper money endlessly, but they can’t control limited assets.

This is the era of walking away from useless paper money. Young people will never be able to buy a home with paper money.

Go for gold, go for limited assets, go for things with real value.

Yes, companies generate profits but don’t hire anyone. Fine. Then I opt out of this system. I won’t hold my savings in paper. Every salary they pay me, I convert into gold or other tangible assets.

They pay us with paper shit that’s worth less and less in this economy. So keep only the bare minimum of paper for basic needs and save the rest in gold. That’s something they can’t print, can’t multiply, can’t control with interest rates.

Protect yourself from latestage capitalism, because money will keep losing value.

As companies hoard all the paper money, let them. We, ordinary people, should leave them with their useless paper while we hold gold and real assets just like before they tricked us into replacing real value with worthless paper.




Today, gold is the back swan event, because the dollar will soon collapse. Companies hoard all the profits, house prices in dollars are insanely high, and paper money is worth nothing.

I go to work, I get paid a salary and that only makes sense as long as, in some reasonable perspective, I can afford a house. A big house with a pool, not a rat-sized apartment for 3 million.

But young people today? They’re supposed to believe that if they just keep their jobs jobs that might not even be taken over by AI they’ll maybe afford a house in their 50s or 60s.

Paper money is worth nothing. The real Black Swan event that people don’t even see is this staying away from paper money. Buy assets. Buy value. Buy tangible things, not worthless paper whose value keeps dripping and dropping every year, paper money loosing value is a sure thing ",0,29,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1npnv31/how_capitalism_will_collapse_run_away_from_money/,new,Discussion,0.3

I started to understand value investing as I got more experience, and one thing I've struggled with is managing my own life and keeping in touch with the news. When my personal life gets busy (exams, tests, internships, traveling), not following the news a lot of times make me feel like I'm losing out on profits. 

An example from my experience is that I bought ASML around February and it stayed at around the same price until their earnings report I think 2 months ago (could be wrong on the time). The stock fell 10% due to the report and I had to decide whether I want to buy more. It fell as their earnings report detailed that due to tariffs and other factors, their earnings might not grow in 2026 (very rough summary). As I was busy during that time, I didn't feel informed enough to double down on my position, which looking back on it now, I think I would've if I took the time to look into it (obviously could be hindsight). 

For more context, I hold stocks usually for over a year, and I look to hold companies that are undervalued with wide moat. Therefore, although I'm not as impacted by short term new sentiment, I do wish to capitalize on it when I have firm belief in the foundational value of a stock and the movement  is just short term.

1npj763,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 13:59:30,Is Sprouts Farmers Market ($SFM) Undervalued?,"$SFM has been touted as a long-term growth company; but, after climbing almost 475% in a relatively short time (5 years), has shed 20.3% of its share price in just the past month.

To be completely upfront, I picked up shares of $SFM at $140/share back in February.  At that time, it was right on the border if its intrinsic value calculation.  From a Value Investing perspective, I didn't give myself much Margin of Safety....  Nonetheless, I was thrilled as the stock climbed to $182/share...only to tumble to its current level of $116/share.  So, my thesis is that $SFM is indeed undervalued.

What caused such a precipitous drop?  Well, we all know that Mr. Market is moody, fickle, unbalanced, the list goes on.  The market has soured on specialty retailers and grocers; so no surprise that while Sprouts continues to expand and grow, it's stock is being sold.  Let's look at a few numbers \[with help from Simply Wall Street\]:

**Discounted Cash Flow Model:**  FCF sits at $499.6M.  Based on analysts' growth forecast, FCF is expected to hit \~$922M by 2029.  DCF's model then calculates the stocks fair value at $236 per share; or, undervalued by 49%.

**Price vs. Earnings:**  Sprouts' current PE Ratio sits at 24.3x, with the industry/peer average around 21x.  SWS's ""Fair Ratio"" (incorporates the company’s actual earnings growth, sector-specific risks, profit margins, and even market capitalization) comes out to 22.0x; so in context, SFM isn't too far off.

**Other Models Quick Summary**:  Without belaboring the data, looking across several other models I find fair valuations ranging from $155 to $209.  My own calculations using the conservative Rule #1 model yields a ""Sticker Price"" of $132.56, and thus a 20% MoS of $106.05, or ultra-conservative 50% MoS of $66.28.

I see a target of opportunity for anyone willing to hold the company for more than just a short-term swing trade.  So, I still have my original shares at $140 (yes...in the red right now), and I have cash covered PUTs to buy additional shares at $120 and $115.  I'm still not giving myself much MoS, but for a company with relatively low long-term debt to FCF, and ROIC consistently over 10% for the past 10 years, I'm happy to be a part owner of Sprouts Farmers Market for the next several years.

  
UPDATE:  Yep.  I see it.  $SFM down again today (25 Sep).  I continue to scour for news as to why, and continue to find bull-case articles and assertions that it is ""undervalued"" and ""oversold""--likely a result of fund managers behaving like lemmings as they often do.  This reminds me of $RH where they were crushed by tariff news, then had a better-than-expected quarter (plus tariff postponement) and over-rebounded, then fell off a cliff again.  It took a few months, but now they are showing signs of a more reasonable, slow-steady climb (I sold my shares at $230).  I'm anticipating a similar pattern for SFM.",7,60,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1npj763/is_sprouts_farmers_market_sfm_undervalued/,new,Stock Analysis,0.67

His fiance is pregnant with their first child. A baby boy so I am a grandfather at the age of 43. I would like to do something to give my grandson a little head start when he gets older. I would like to open a stock portfolio for him now. He will be born in March. Then, let it grown until he is about 30 years of age or so. I figure by that time he will have completed college. Be settled into a career and possibly be settled down a little. 

I tried investing in bitcoin and the stock market years ago. I picked the wrong time to do it. It turned out to be right before COVID and it was all bad. I lost a good bit of money. I contribute a good bit of it to not knowing what the hell I was doing too. Now I have been doing a lot of reading and research. I started a little project since then where I invested a little money to get my feet wet and was able to do pretty good. Therefore, I would like to start another project for my grandson.

I did pretty good with a little small portfolio I put together for practice. Just a couple hundred bucks to get my feet wet. I basically just picked stocks from companies whose products I use and know about. I work in computer repair so most of the stocks were technology stocks. I know about diversifying your portfolio. That ETFs are more conservative where individual companies is more risky. So I know the basics which is why I am asking for help and advice.

My question is if I do something like I just did where I start a small portfolio. Say maybe $500 to start. Then, if I add a little money to it monthly (maybe over time other family members with pitch in) do you think I could grow it into something decent by age 30 or so? This is an amount of money I wouldn’t be upset with if I was to lose it all as long as I have a really decent shot at successfully completing the mission. 

Would it be better to maybe split the money between two portfolios? One conservative and one pretty aggressive? What would be a good strategy to go about this? Like I said I am a single parent. I am far from well off. I wish I had thousands I could have smartly invested. However, that is not the reality, and I want to leave my grandchild SOMETHING.

I’ve been looking into the recent IPO of **WaterBridge Infrastructure (WBI)** and wanted to get some perspectives from the community.

**Quick summary of the IPO:**

* Raised **$634M** by selling 31.7M Class A shares at **$20/share**.
* IPO was upsized due to stronger demand.
* Debuted on the NYSE mid-September and reportedly jumped \~14% on day one.
* Operates primarily in the **Delaware Basin**, providing water gathering, transport, recycling, and disposal for oil & gas producers.
* Business model includes **take-or-pay contracts**, which in theory could provide stable cash flows.

**Points I’m curious about:**

1. How do you see WBI’s risk/reward profile given its exposure to oil & gas cycles and regulatory risks around water disposal?
2. Does the IPO valuation look reasonable compared to other water infrastructure or midstream companies?
3. Are there comparable publicly traded peers (water management in energy, midstream infrastructure, etc.) worth benchmarking against?
4. Do you view this as a potential **long-term infrastructure play** tied to water management, or more of a niche/speculative investment?

Just hoping to hear some analysis and opinions from those who follow IPOs, infrastructure, or energy-linked companies.

Thanks in advance!",2,1,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1npenuj/water_stocks/,new,Stock Analysis,0.75

1npdpk7,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 10:31:39,CRWV and CORZ,"All previous crypto mining stocks transitioning to AI/HPC are going up. Why? Because big tech is throwing money at them. MSFT, META, GOOG CEO’s have all acknowledged that the biggest restriction to AI growth is power not GPUs. Which companies have the most amount of power to power data centers? CRWV and CORZ. The demand is so far beyond what people currently understand. 

MSFT threw a $19B deal at NBIS for 300MW + 400MW extension. CRWV has 470MW active as of Q2 2025, and target ~1000MW by year end. They are a preferred NVIDIA partner. NVIDIA also announced that they are backstopping any excess cloud from CRWV for up to $6B up to 2030. Even if they need it or not, they agreed to this. CRWV has 2.2GW of contracted power capacity that they can expand into (the bottleneck). 

CORZ has $5B market cap. They have 900MW of power that is active and dedicated to AI but needs connecting to GPUs etc. another 400MW used for Bitcoin mining, bringing total to 1.3GW. They also have 1GW of expansion also possible. They had 50MW active and powering GPUs by Q2 2025. Year end goal is 250MW. That is 5x the revenue they were generating before. They also still have 650MW more to expand to. Remember NBIS got a $19B deal for 300MW + 400MW possible expansion. I value CORZ at $15B market cap, would not even think about selling before. I expect them to crush next earnings call and market to price them closer to fair value. For the acquisition by CRWV deal, this will not go through unless CRWV stock goes up a lot higher maybe $200. Shareholders are not happy with current deal (Two Seas capital which is largest active shareholder has shown opposition). Stock price also tanked ~30% after deal announcement, but this will also not go through unless shareholders approve (big opposition over current deal). 

Finally, just want to mention big hedge fund buying. Jane Street and Coatue Management are hedge funds that have outperformed the market significantly over last 3 years (achieving 90%+ and 180%+ over last 3 years) have made CRWV their biggest holding at 4% and 8% respectively. There is also a cracked OpenAI guy (1st in his class in Columbia) that started his own hedge fund called Situational Awareness who has like 65% returns over last two quarters has CORZ as his third biggest holding at 20% of his portfolio.

1npambc,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 08:20:12,Deep Value with $GAMB,"Recently stumbled upon some posts on here asking why gambling.com stock is so cheap right now.

They are profitable with good margins, growing, got a great CEO who has been with the company for almost 10 years, share buybacks and more - yet the stock chart looks like they are going bankrupt.

I read trough their balance sheets and watched all interviews with the CEO and i cant find a single reason why the market is overreacting like this.
One of their recent aquisitions ""Oddjams"" has a lawsuit against them for scraping odds data from third parties but i feel like its hard to really combat data scraping and pinpoint whats legal and what crosses the line. Even if guilty, it may take years for the lawsuit to resolve.

In the meanwhile GAMB is using their insane cashflow to aquire more and more businesses while growing their marketshare and diversifying income streams.

This feels like a generational buy at these levels - i would argue there is assymetric alpha here.
The fair value of the stock is about 60-70% upside from just ebit and cashflow. Factor in the meme-worthy ticker that will tickle the wallstreetbets fans and a CEO that knows what he is doing (and is rewarded with an options plan if the stock price reaches X for 6 months) and you got a great play in my books.

Personally (and funnily enough) All-In on the stock at these levels.
Market thinks this is an affiliate marketing company but its missed that all the buyouts diversified away from it with a much broader setup for the future. They are quietly buying companies to build out their offers and tech worldwide.

Feel free to give your opinion!
I will be holding this bag for a long time - i think the future is great.

One section talks about the factors that drive stock prices. Graham breaks them down into three categories:

* **Market factors**
* **Future value factors**
* **Intrinsic value factors**

These factors not only influence the bids and offers in the market (which ultimately set the price), but also serve as the line between *speculating* and *investing*, depending on which factors you choose to focus on.

Big drop in free cash flow last year. Over the last five years, they averaged about $6.5 billion. Last year, just $3.5 billion. Looks like they made some capital improvements, but check out the five-year net income versus the one-year net income. Not great.

Men’s underwear, cardboard boxes, and giant skeletons: Offbeat recession indicators to watch

Unemployment and consumer spending can signal the direction of the economy. Some believe more nebulous data points hold clues too.

Emma Ockerman
Tue, September 23, 2025 at 7:02 PM GMT+2 7 min read


From Labubus **(1)** and men’s underwear to lipstick and skirt hems, signs pointing to or away from a recession are everywhere.

Whether they’re accurate indicators of the economy's health is another matter.

Here’s how recessions are actually defined: A committee with the National Bureau of Economic Research **(2)** that maintains a chronology of US business cycles pores over official monthly releases from government agencies, like employment and income data, to date periods that represent a “significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.”

That process can take a while. In June 2020, for example, the NBER declared the country had entered a recession **(3)** in February of that year — an unusually fast determination. In July 2021, the NBER said **(4)** the country had exited the recession in April 2020. **(5)**

Otherwise, experts turn to other reliable, albeit unofficial, recession signs, including two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, or the “Sahm rule,” **(6)** which finds the start of a recession occurs when the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate rises 0.5 percentage points or more, relative to its 12-month low.

Now, with consumer sentiment tanking, inflation ticking higher, the job market stagnating — and social media users speculating that short, bare nails **(7)** herald economic malaise — here are other less-than-traditional measures to watch.

Cardboard boxes

Cardboard box demand is sometimes seen as an indicator of economic health, since the majority of what consumers purchase touches corrugated cardboard. Here’s the not-so-great news: Right now, US box makers are cutting back on production, ** (8)** said Jadrian Wooten, an economist at Virginia Tech. Box shipments are also down.


“I love this recession indicator, or I guess potential indicator, because it is such a common item that I think a lot of people take it for granted,” Wooten said.

Even former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan reportedly used to track cardboard prices. **(9)**

“The cardboard box industry is incredibly large — we’re talking close to $100 billion in revenue,” Wooten said. “What I always tell my students at Virginia Tech is that it’s four times as big as the NFL, and they hear about the NFL every day, on TV, on social media, there are video games about it. We don’t have that about the cardboard box industry. It’s so much more important.”

Many US boxes are shipped abroad, and exports are expected to weaken amid trade tensions, **(10)** which could help explain lower packaging demand. US consumer spending, which has so far remained resilient, may also grind lower as prices rise, dimming the need for tons of shipments.

Right now, the cardboard story is also one about capacity, Wooten said, with multiple plants being taken offline in the most dramatic cuts since the Great Recession.

All of this taking place before the holiday shopping season is doubly concerning.

“This is actually the peak time for the holiday season that we would expect to see ramp-ups in cardboard box production happening,” Wooten said. “That’s probably the biggest concern in terms of a pending recession: Companies are not ordering cardboard boxes to put their products in to then send to Target or Walmart for the holiday season.”


If looks could indicate

Americans have long sought to tease economic signals from fashion and style choices. It’s been said, for example, that skirt hemlines lengthen, natural roots start to show, men’s underwear goes unreplaced, and clothes grow more muted during an economic downturn.

It’s also been said, however, that many of those “indicators” are far from reliable. The hemline index in particular has been debunked **(11)** — midi skirts trended in 2019, for example, when economic conditions were otherwise solid, and micro-mini skirts trended around the time the dot-com bubble burst.


And it was Greenspan, again, who told NPR **(12)** that a dip in men’s underwear sales could be indicative of a troubled economy.

But is it?

“I cover Hanesbrands and Gildan, which both make underwear, and I can tell you that nobody at either company has ever told me that,” said David Swartz, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar.

“Greenspan was totally blindsided by the economic crisis in 2008, so clearly his underwear indicator did not help him, did it?” Swartz added.

During times of economic hardship, retailers may say consumers are becoming more “choiceful"" **(13)** or discerning in their purchases.

“It doesn’t mean that they don’t spend, it just means that they aren’t necessarily spending on things as they would if the economy was in better shape,” Swartz said.

The 'little treat' economy

A few months after the 9/11 attacks — at which point the US was already in a recession — Leonard Lauder, then the chairman of the Estée Lauder Companies, said ""when things get tough, women buy lipstick,” according to a Guardian report from the time. **(14)**

""In stressful times, many consumers are reaching out for those small indulgences that provide momentary pleasure,” Lauder said.

This sentiment started being referred to as the “Lipstick Index,” and it somewhat tracks with the idea of today’s “little treat economy,” or the rise of people indulging in more affordable pick-me-ups (an iced coffee, maybe, or a cute keychain) as a form of self-care.

“I don’t know that there’s any clear evidence that women decide to buy more lipstick because they feel bad about the economy or something like that,” Swartz said. “My opinion would be that when there’s a recession, people cut back on everything, and that probably includes lipstick.”

More indicative of economic conditions, perhaps, is whether or not people are going out to eat, which is generally more expensive than cooking at home. And restaurant traffic is indeed on the decline, **(15)** with the cost of food away from home up 3.9% in the past year. **(16)**


“You can also look at things like sales in discount versus sales in department stores,” Swartz said. “We’ve seen much stronger results from retailers like TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack and Ross compared to department stores. We’ve also seen weakness in the luxury space.”

Giant skeletons

Sean Bagniewski, a Democratic state representative in Iowa serving the Des Moines area, posited in a newsletter he sent in August that the apparent lackluster demand for giant, 12-foot skeleton sales at Home Depot could suggest economic rain clouds ahead.

He has his own “Skelly” and noted that “there are lively Facebook groups that focus on this and other Home Depot Halloween items each season.” Despite retailing for $299, they often sell out fast when they hit stores. And, since Home Depot (HD) did not do a spring sale of Halloween decorations this year, Bagniewski told Yahoo Finance, it seemed likely that August’s decoration drop would generate a lot of interest.

“Though I have one, I was curious to watch how the Skellies got snapped up when they were released at about 5:15 one morning earlier this month,” he wrote. **(17)** “In 2023, all of them were purchased within the hour. In 2024, all of them were gone by noon. This year, there were more than 3,000 that were still available on the Home Depot site 13 hours after they were released.”

“That’s not as fancy as Greenspan economics, but I’d say it’s interesting anecdotal evidence that folks are feeling a pinch in their pocketbooks,” he added.

A spokesperson for Home Depot said they couldn’t “share any sales specifics around any products,” though “we continue to see fans embracing Skelly into their Halloween collections.”

As of the morning of Sept. 23, Skellies remain in stock. **(18)** Indeed, some commenters noted in a Facebook group devoted to Home Depot’s Halloween products that they had tighter budgets this year or were waiting for discounts, though others spent thousands of dollars on decorations.

Still, Bagniewski sees red flags when families scale back on luxury items that make their kids happy.

“If people aren’t buying those — and it’s been a hot-ticket item in past years — then that should be somewhat of a warning sign,” Bagniewski said.

He said a lot of companies are pulling back on hiring because the outlook feels uncertain. He also doubled down on being cautious with rate cuts, worried that moving too early could let inflation slip out of control. On top of that, tariffs are still a risk for prices, and while AI is boosting investment, the long-term impact is still up in the air. Powell also admitted the stock market looks pricey by historical standards, but kept a neutral tone. The only hint was that “moderately restrictive” policy could mean there’s room for gradual, measured cuts ahead.

Bowman, on the other hand, took a much more aggressive stance — saying the Fed should cut sooner to prevent job losses and layoffs from snowballing.

1noy49y,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 20:28:19,Crocs stock - value trap?,"Hey everyone! 

Long time lurker, and longer time value investor.

I’ve had a position in Crocs for some time now. Disappointed with the recent dip, but I believe the market has oversold pretty heavily. I’m considering adding to my already heavily allocated (as a % of my portfolio) position.

The company has been growing revenue and cash flow for quite a while now. They’ve been buying back shares and paying down the debt from the HeyDude acquisition aggressively. While the acquisition has panned out as a bit of a disappointment (see the recent impairment), it has undoubtedly taken the company to another level. They are forecasting revenue declines for the current quarter which hasn’t helped the stock price. 

All that being said, this company is selling at dirt cheap multiples. Even adjusting for the revenue decline, it will be one of the most undervalued cash flow streams in the market. The balance sheet is relatively healthy, and I’m expecting them to announce having purchased 2-3% of outstanding shares during this quarter - as the price is deflated.

They have shown significant international sales growth despite the slow down in the Americas. Their shoes are priced at some of the lowest levels versus most of their competitors AND they still get a higher margin than most of them. The management team has even advised part of the revenue decline is due to a pull back in promotions to preserve brand integrity. On the HeyDude side, revenue has been showing notable declines - although a bullish investor can attribute this to a shift in business model to drive D2C sales at higher margin than HeyDude’s wholesale strategy. 

I wanted to gather this community’s thoughts. Is their last report and this current quarter the start of the end? And therefore the market is pricing their stock accordingly? Or is this a true value play with blood in the streets and far too negative market sentiment for a historically great company (and one that still looks to be a good deal even if revenue declines over the next 5-10 years).

1nou72b,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 17:36:40,Thoughts on Target Corp-Possibly good ROE at these levels.,"Not an owner at present, looking for discussion from people who've looked at this stock before.

Obviously Retail is a mixed bag of margin compression and macro risk. Tariffs are the elephant in the room here.  Target has struggled way more than other big box retailers. However,  I think target is getting close to a good value oriented entry point here.  It is currently trading at less the 10x last year's stated free cash flow.  Previous years, with the exception of FY2023, see average comparable FCF yields.  I see them possibly upgrading their rewards program to drive more traffic.  Over the past ten years, they have bought back approx. 40 percent of their shares outstanding.  They have raised the dividend and have seemed resolved to keep it's dividend intact.  Also another factor here is the real estate porfolio within the overall stock price.  Including the real estate, the actual retail business of Target seems to be valued at very low valuation, if not, negative.  

Now what I'm saying here is not that Target is going make any gigantic headway in it's stock price, but I do believe it's possible for them to offer a decent return on equity through dividend and possible additional buyback opportunities via its cash flow.  I could see Target reclaiming its affordable chic mantel within the retail landscape.  

The only reason is even bring this up is I see Walmart, Costco, Amazon trading at fairly high multiples.  My curiosity is whether a retailer with maybe some more upscale exposure should be trading at literal fractions of a multiple lower.  

Let me know what your thoughts are, what am i getting wrong, and what you think is a better option in terms of VALUE investing.

1nopl2t,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 14:39:57,Will PayPal stock price explode?,"Hey everyone, 

Just wanted to get your feedback on my stock analysis of PayPal. 

PayPal does not need any introduction, it has been a major player in FinTech but has recently been challenged by the new competition landscape (Apple Pay, Google Wallet, Adyen...) and revenue growth has slowed to single digits which has brought the stock price down. 

Looking at their Business model, they make most of their money (around 90%) through transaction fees from Merchants and Consumers. With the world going digital with payments, this is a good model. Moreover, they will soon launch the PayPal World service which will interconnect the biggest payment schemes from Latin America(Mercado Pago), India (UPI), and China (WeChat). This last point gives them momentum to reach for new markets and expand their revenue growth. 

Taking into consideration their financials (from Yahoo Finance), PayPal has a Debt to Equity ratio of 60.25%, signaling healthy signs. Moreover, the forward P/E is 11.67, which is also low. Lastly, they are undergoing a big share buyback policy, which would ultimately bring share prices up. 

I haven't done any Discounted Cash Flow model to calculate the stock price, but looking at some analysis on Youtube, it seems like the intrinsic value of this stock is around USD 120. 

I personally think they are some good upsides with this stock and wanted to share that thought with you. If you would like to challenge that, please be my guest, I am looking forward to hearing your arguments.

Their GLP1 drugs treat one of the most common ailments on earth, and yet they are beaten down while the market is at all time highs. However, I’m not going to be making much of a bull case for GLP1’s here, others have done that. This post is about identifying lesser known companies that stand to benefit from the bull case for GLP1’s coming to fruition, as well as international markets. Here is what you need to know: 

The biggest news I really hope you know as a GLP1 investor is that semaglutide’s patents expire (all of them) next year in Canada, India, Brazil, Turkey, and Mexico. This has been well known for a while so it's not a huge drag on NVO or LLY, but we should all consider what generic GLP1’s hitting the market at the same time as orals next year will do. These two coinciding events could rapidly diminish the spooky novelty and price of these drugs, driving demand and adoption throughout the world. Next year will be pivotal, but this also raises the question, which companies are making the first truly affordable versions of these drugs?

First, this won’t be a market for just any generics maker, only those experienced in manufacturing biosimilar peptides and injectables will have a chance here, so it's not as zero-sum as some simple pressed pill generics market. The first mover will be the Swiss generics maker Sandoz (SDZNY) which plans to have generics on shelves in Canada by January at around $75 dollars a month (\~70% discount to current prices). That is the price of a nice gym membership. The other confirmed entrants in Canada will be Apotex (private), BIOCON.NS, and Dr. Reddy’s (RDY). Expect TEVA pharma and Viatris (VTRS) to enter later.  

I like SDZ quite a bit, price-to-sales of 2.4, forward P/E of 25. It’s up 45% this year but that's not ridiculous in this market. Here is some quick back of the napkin math: 

Current estimate is 2026 total revenue grows from 11B to 11.875B, 3%(300M) increase y/y from 2025 growth. Currently 1M Canadian GLP1 users, 4M total type 2 diabetics. Let’s say SDZ gets 500k of sales at $75 for 10 months of 2026, that is 375M of new revenue from just Canada GLP1’s next year. This is an extremely rough estimate, but I buy the general case of SDZ’s revenue from just GLP1’s next year being underestimated. 

RDY like SDZ is an experienced biosimilars manufacturer and has plans to aggressively enter all markets open to generics, especially its home market India. With a p/e of 18, p/s of 3, basically no debt and \~800M in cash RDY looks like a value play in an expensive market. If these drugs take off in these foreign markets this could be criminally undervalued. Now a bit more on these markets specifically:

Brazil is an underrated market, there are \~70-80M Brazilians who have private health insurance and make up a wealthier cohort who live very much like the average American. A study found this cohort’s life expectancy (83yrs) is actually higher. Of this privately insured cohort, \~14M are obese, and \~6M have type 2 diabetes. This is much larger than the Canadian market, and should be made up of fairly analogous market participants. There are, of course, the other 150M Brazilians as well. Consider [HYPE3.SA](http://HYPE3.SA) as a pure Brazil play, but SDZ, RDY, BIOCON, and TEVA will all be here as well.

Expect BIOCON, RDY, and SUN Pharmaceuticals to dominate an Indian market that while very large (70M-85M type 2 diabetics), will be extremely crowded, and frankly hard to gauge in terms of adoption. I want to buy BIOCON as they are an experienced exporter with a large Canadian presence, but I’ve had no luck doing so because there are no ADRs. 

A final note on generics, TEVA may win in the end at least revenue-wise. They are the generics giant, have the most know-how, and have quietly already got their foot in the door. Just a couple months ago they started making generic liraglutide in the US, an early GLP1 (not very good, so not a huge deal). This won’t impact their bottom line but it builds their GLP1 production capability for free, expect them to enter these markets aggressively, if you like the value here like I do, make it your top generics play.

Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) is a speculative play that I’m sure many of you have probably heard of. They make an oral that just completed phase 2 trials successfully, but the market hated the results due to high expectations. Personally, having read the study, I think it was blown out of proportion and it's valued nicely as a speculative play. I certainly like their drug better than Amgen’s or Metsera/Pfizer’s because it is an oral with genuinely good weight loss results already in phase 3 trials.

Telemedicine is the last obvious place to look here, the pick is LifeMD (LFMD).  NVO and LLY are never going to do business with HIMS again after the compounding issue, and HIMS cannot directly sell semaglutide or tirzepitide at all. LFMD has direct partnerships with both LLY and NVO and directly sells on their platform. Buy this as a fairly pure GLP1 play in telemedicine, and don’t worry too much about them getting sued, that's just a right of passage for telemedicine companies (seriously though). The valuation here is also just flat out good, 1.3 p/s (compared to HIMS’ 6.5) and analysts are rating it with serious upside right now. I may have buried the lede here as LFMD is arguably the purest GLP1 bull case play other than NVO and LLY and it is nice and beaten down, the red flags are the lawsuits and potential regulatory issues with telemedicine. 

A final note: NVO’s EVOKE Phase 3 Alzheimer’s/Dementia study will report results by the end of 2025, maybe any day now. Results will likely be middle of the road, if they are bad, well, we’ll take a hit with losing potential dementia treatment upside. But if results are good the sky might be the limit here, if GLP1’s can significantly treat obesity and Alzheimer’s with an oral pill… well you do the math. Get in or get out before these results drop. 

My GLP1 portfolio is about 35% LLY, 20% NVO, 15% LFMD, 10% TEVA, 10% SDZ, 5% RDY, and 5% VKTX. Good luck all.

1nonf0l,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 13:18:11,The Denison Mines investment thesis.,"The Athabasca Basin region contains the world's highest uranium grades, and Denison Mines is capitalizing on that. Denison has four low cost uranium development projects which they have a range of interest, 22.5%, 25.17%, 70.55% interest, they include a mill, another mine, and some exploration.

As it stands, their balance sheet is solid having just received 333 million in cash bringing them to $721 million in cash, uranium and investments. They sold convertible notes in a capped call strategy, which means that investor can buy a certain number of shares up to $4.32 for the next 6 years with an annual coupon of 4.25% (way better for reducing stock dilution)

Their flagship project, Wheeler River, will develop two assets, an in situ recovery operation for onsite processing, and a convention underground mining operation with a milling toll at their 22.5% mill. The capital expenditure of this project is $429 million. It's a 16.5 year mine with an 11 month repayment and in IRR of 90%. Production is planned to startup mid 2028.

Not to mention a huge amount of the float and stock is owned by institutions.

All that is to say, I think the bull case for DNN is incredibly strong with current market and geopolitical context. Kazatomprom, the largest Uranium producer in the world is running into bottlenecks to keep up with demand.

I think there is strong potential for DNN to see a continued interest from investors. This kind of company with a $2.5 billion market cap is actually one that could be a lot higher. Cameco who operates in the region 37 billion. How quickly can Denison grow and further develop their balance sheet?

1non3ev,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 13:05:49,Is $BIRK the most undervalued stock in footwear?,"Hey r/valueinvesting. I thought I would do my first DD post. I've been expanding my horizons into consumer goods stocks lately.I am mainly a tech growth guy, but I may have found a gem with Birkenstock. Birkenstock is an iconic German footwear brand that has been around since 1774. Recently they've started selling boots, clogs, and have now dabbled into the skincare world. They went public in Oct. 2023 at $46/share and dipped post-IPO, but has been slowly climbing back. Now shares are trading around $45 with a market cap of 12 billion. With a P/E of 25, I'm seeing plenty of brand-recognition moat, growth, and consistent revenue growth. If you've stepped onto a college campus recently you may have noticed the explosion of sandals with Gen-Z. Since Birkenstock is the main brand of sandals, Gen Z should be coming back to keep buying for the rest of their lives.

* Revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 20% in the last few years, hitting 1.5B in FY2024. Net income margins are improving up to 10% thanks to their premium pricing and increase of efficiency. $BIRK has also expanded into the Asia-Pacific region and DTC now account for 40% of their sales, up from 30% pre-IPO.
* With 250 years of history, their products are positioned higher than a fast fashion trend. Average selling price is steadily increasing 5% per year.
* Forward P/E is currently at 19. Completely reasonable for a growth stock in consumer goods. If they are still on track to climb their revenue 20% this year, they will hit an EPS of $2.50.
* Birkenstock is aiming for 100+ new locations by 2027.

Their balance sheet is clean: EBITDA <1x, 300 million in free cash flow, with upcoming buybacks and dividends. I think $BIRK is screaming 'opportunity.'

The only downside I think is plausible is that they are not recession-proof. No one will buy $150 sandals in a recession. Overall, I still think $BIRK could be a great play over these next years.

1nom5ay,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 12:30:44,JP Morgan buy thesis on ASML,"From JP Morgan: ""TSMC has started to ramp up its 2nm process and this process ramp will continue in ’26 when their lead customer, Apple, is likely to start using this process. There have also been press reports yesterday that Nvidia is expected to be the first to adopt the upcoming A16 process at TMSC which will implement backside power. If these reports are true, then TSMC would need to ramp up significant capacity for A16 in ’27 (when it is likely to be in production). A16 will need 1 or 2 more EUV exposures than 2nm and thus will be particularly positive for ASML because of the increase in lithography intensity but more importantly because of the volume of wafer capacity that would need to be added if Nvidia were to start using the leading edge process (Nvidia has been using a process that is 1 or 2 generations behind the leading edge on its leading edge processors till now). TSMC would need to start preparing for Nvidia ramp in terms of orders and building capacity in 2H26 which would result in stronger orders/sales for ASML from TSMC in both ’26 but definitely in ’27.

HBM-related demand remains robust and memory pricing has not shown weakness. Indications have been that Samsung is possibly closer to qualification for HBM4 at Nvidia as well, which would be very positive for equipment shipments starting end of ’26 into ’27. Thus, risks that ASML guides to a weak ’26 are becoming much less likely in our opinion and ’27 trends will be strong (though not guided so soon by ASML). Importantly for the stock, once ASML guides to ’26 revenue range on October 15th, only ’27 will matter and though ASML will not guide to it, the market will speculate on positive trends and that should help the stock. ASML also continues to trade below prior average multiple of 30-35x and thus appears attractive. We reiterate that ASML remains our top pick in ‘25.""

Positive sell side reports have been a major catalyst for ASML over the last month. Coverage of ASML had become widely negative throughout '25. There are two bear theses which are related. The first is that litho intensity has peaked in terms of capex requirements to move to the next nodes. The second thesis is that high-NA won’t be adopted for a while as it is not economic. 

While TSMC didn’t introduce scaling at the N2 node as they moved to the new GAA transistor architecture (nanosheets), we should see scaling at the next one or even two nodes again—which will be a positive for ASML. On the second bear thesis, the positive is that high-NA is much more economic than EUV at its early introduction, as EUV’s uptime and productivity were extremely low. The technology had all sorts of problems and there were continuously bear theses flying around that the technology will never make it. The positive for ASML though is that even if high-NA gets delayed, more multiple patterning with EUV tools will be needed at the most advanced processing steps, which actually increases revenues and margins for ASML (high-NA is lower margin than EUV due to current low capacity levels).

So, the long term bull case for ASML is that:  

1. TSMC at its next one or two nodes will start scaling again, leading to increased EUV demand as more EUV process steps will be needed again.  

2. TSMC is building out three fab clusters—one in the US and two in Taiwan, where capacity requirements are increasing due to the boom in AI demand.  

3. DRAM is becoming more EUV intensive, due to the scaling roadmap.  AI is very DRAM intensive (HBM), boosting needed fab capacity.  

4. ASML has zero competition.

I'd add some charts here with further details but apparently Reddit doesn't allow this - anyways, more background on the current outlook in AI can be found here, which is an important driver for future  ASML tool orders:

- Citigroup have upgraded their price target to £14.40 / $19.44. (The difference appears to be that Citigroup have recognised how massively exciting the Nuclear Energy side of the business is, whereas Goldman haven’t even mentioned it.)

- JP. Morgan have also just identified Rolls-Royce as top 12-month picks, and them as capable of exceeding consensus earnings forecasts in the second half of 2025, placing them on Positive Catalyst Watch. https://www.reddit.com/r/RYCEY/s/mq1EpPz6Vv

- Nuclear energy stocks are roaring upwards, sending nuclear energy speculative stocks soaring despite being loss-making, and despite no revenues in some cases (OKLO!), so it’s only a matter of time before attention turns to a high-growth, cash-generative business like Rolls Royce, which keeps announcing new deals.

- Rolls-Royce won a £2,500,000,000 deal in June to build nuclear reactors in the United Kingdom.

Since 2012, there have been seventy 12V 4000 engines used in trains operated by Saudi Arabia Railways, and – having been impressed by their quality even in the harshest of conditions – Saudi Arabia have ordered an additional 50 trains with RR engines, as announced a month ago.

Sure I’ve missed so many things there as all the many divisions of Rolls-Royce seems to be on turbo charge at the moment.

With aviation demand rising (and especially from Airbus more than Boeing),  with defence spending rising, and with the growing and desperate need for more sustainable energy solutions from nuclear, etc etc, it is inevitable that Rolls-Royce will be announcing more deals on all fronts in the coming weeks and months.

All the mag7 companies that have slimmed down over the last 3 years are flush with cash and any big capex like 500m deals on AI build out or data centers is just a vapid money washing scheme that makes everyone’s earnings seem massive and impressive and holy shit look how profitable all these companies are but when you look past the deals no one is actually pulling any value out of consumers???

Sure, Google impressions are rising yada yada. How much is openAI actually worth if they need subscriptions to a service and there’s 20 other chatGPTs doing the same shit when the curve levels out (I guess my thesis also relies on AI not exploding as fast as everyone thinks and taking over every job ever in 3 years)

Im just wondering if I’m in the right ballpark and if you guys can see where this leads. Is there a turning point in this bubble where the piper needs to be paid and everyone gets exposed as snake oil salesmen all colluding to make themselves look highly profitable?

Background: As a hobbyist value investor, my daily routine looks like this: Wall Street Journal, Google News, The Guardian, Yahoo News… rinse and repeat. The result? Tons of time wasted, with only a tiny fraction of useful information. Even worse, by the time I finally find a truly relevant piece of news, the market has already reacted，umm....like a gossiping neighbor who’s always two steps ahead.

So about six months ago, I just built my own tool, named Deeptracker. The original idea was pretty simple:

1. Automatically track the news for me
2. Push it to me within 1 minute of publication
3. Bonus: attach a quick “market sentiment score” so I don’t lose my sanity

Recently, I hustled my way into getting **12 people** to try it. Yep...twelve, not twelve hundred... But hey, I tried . The feedback was actually better than expected:

* Some said it saved them tons of time hunting for relevant news
* Some said it caught details they would’ve missed manually
* One even said it’s better than finviz (and to me, that’s like winning a medal )

Of course, there were criticisms too:

* “Alerts are nice, but sources must be authoritative.” (I swear I hooked it up to legit sources!)
* “Features could be expanded.” (Sounds a fair point  :)

I can’t wait to find out:

1. Do you also feel buried under the daily avalanche of news?
2. If you landed on my product page, would you at least think the design is okay-ish?
3. Or should I just accept that DT is my quirky personal tool, and the market demand might not even be real?",0,5,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nof2q8/does_anyone_actually_need_a_free_personalized/,new,Investing Tools,0.14

I try to explain to them what I have achieved and they listen politely and nod and at the end they say ""good work"" before they take the conversation in a 90 degree turn away from the topics of investing and me being awesome. 

I do searches such as asking google ""is 30% a good return on my investments?"" And then devour every scrap telling me how well I am doing. It conjures an image in my mind of someone(that would be me, I am the someone in my minds eye) masturbating while simultaneously they have stuck a hose from one of those pedal press bike pumps deep in the ear and the person(again, the person being spoken aboit here is me) rhythmically alternates between q stroke and a foot tap ad nauseum... stroke, foot tap, stroke, foot tap, stroke, foot tap, stroke, foot tap, stroke...  each action engorging a different body part, both stealing blood from the other temporarily in a struggle to engorge themselves. 

Sorry for that detour. Moving on, I remember the GFC and all the wealth that was wiped out and i remember feeling so bad for everyone affected by the situation... and then some years later I saw that all the wealth had come back and now new records were being smashed. This was when I started to research investing and more crucially, I explored the ideas that came to me from me and overtime I tweaked my ideas, I added components from other steategies, I poured over statistics, I read countless charts and over nearly a dozen years, I had come up with my own investment strategy. Since I first started my investment journey at the beginning of april last year I have refined my strategy, making it better and Dropping what didn't work. The most improvement has come from receiving validation of my methods via results and that has allowed me to use the conviction I now feel to more fully apply my strategy, where before I would sometimes hesitate and buckle (selling too soon, not buying when I should have).

Anyway, I wanted to post images but I dont have the requisite amount of karma so I will just type it out.

My total returns sit at 48.13%, annualised that works out 30.81.

At it's best it's gone as high as a total of 55% and annualised rate of returns of 40%.

I do not use, nor do I understand options, puts or calls. 

I'm not leveraged or using a margin call or whatever it's called. I use no debt whatsoever. 

Currently I have 3.68% in cash and 96.32% in stocks.

36.88% is in US stocks and 73.12% in AU stocks.

US stocks:

Total P/L (USD) 5,771.32

Total Profit (USD)+7,906.82

Total Loss (USD)-2.135.50

Win Rate 74.29% across 105 different posistions.

AU stocks:

Total P/L (AUD) 20,017.17

Total Profit (AUD)+24,112.73

Total Loss (AUD)-4,095.56

Win Rate 73.49% across 83 different positions. 

My Win Rates for both AU and US have both been as high as 80% in the past and are both at the lower end of the spectrum atm. 

I believe that I can see things that others are blind to, that I approach investing wildly different from most people. I regularly watch YouTube videos of people picking stocks and I am blown away by how differently we think and while on the topic of YouTube investors has anyone else noticed how rubbish these people are? I have not seen a single person, not one ever, EVER post a total profit/loss statement covering from start to finish.  

I ask these cringe inducing wankers to please post said total profit/loss and they respond with (what are you? My wife? I dont have to do nothing you tell me to do buddy"" or better still they just ignore me. We all know this is because they are all haemorrhaging money and are travelling through Loss Country. I have an idea for a YouTube channel that attacks these buffoons and posts advice on investing, but I have a unique idea regarding how it would be executed and generate revenue. 

I just realised I have been in a manic state for some time now and had better put a stop to this before it gets even more. Anyway, what do you guys all think of my results so far?

1no7n26,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 00:06:13,$RMCF - Not Financial Advice,"Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory (RMCF) is a ~$1.70 microcap that runs ~250+ chocolate shops/franchises plus wholesale/e-comm. They do around $30M in revenue annually, but the market cap is only -$4.8M net loss), but has started showing positive EBITDA in recent quarters and is rolling out a turnaround plan.

Why it’s interesting:
1. Valuation: Trades at ~0.4× sales - dirt cheap compared to branded specialty retail.
2. Brand footprint: 250+ locations, with new flagships opening (Chicago, Charleston).
3. Execution plan: New e-commerce platform, packaging rebrand, updated POS/ERP for franchisees, and cost discipline (pricing + SG&A).
4. Potential: If margins normalize (20–30% gross, 10–12% EBITDA), the stock has meaningful upside from this tiny base.


Valuation Scenarios:
1. Worst-case: Flat sales, weak margins, dilution → $0.00–$0.40/share.
2. Base case: Margins improve, EBITDA breakeven in 1-2 years → $2.50–$4.00/share.
3. Bull case: Strong margin expansion + brand growth, ~10× EBITDA → $5.00+/share.


Catalysts to watch:
1. Continued gross margin recovery toward 20–25%.
2. Successful rollout of new e-comm + branding.
3.Same-store sales growth + higher franchise royalties.
4. Operating leverage from POS/ERP deployment.
5. Franchise expansion momentum.


Bottom line:
This is a high-risk, asymmetric play - downside could wipe most of the equity, but if the turnaround sticks, upside is 2-3× (base) to 5× (bull). At $1.70, you’re basically paying less than the price of a candy bar for each share in a national chocolate brand.

1no64zm,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 22:48:39,The SMR Nuclear Renaissance seems to be a pipe dream being build on sand,"To get this out of the way, I am not anti-nuclear. I am however, struggling to understand how the economics make sense. I see a lot of posts and comments suggesting it is the only clean energy source that can provide growing baseload power, but the conversation rarely delves deeper than that. 

From what I've seen, the economic and logistical case for Small Modular Reactors seems to completely erode when looking at market data, historical project performance, and even fundamental physics. It looks to me like SMRs are not a viable solution for modern energy needs, as they seem economically uncompetitive, appear to be mirroring the nuclear industry's record of project failure, and could even exacerbate the unresolved problem of radioactive waste.

&nbsp;

**1: Costs:**

Data from Lazard's Levelized Cost of Energy analysis shows that unsubsidized utility-scale solar and onshore wind are the cheapest forms of new generation. 

- **Onshore wind** can have a levelized cost of energy as low as $27 per megawatt-hour, with a midpoint of $50.
- **Utility-scale solar** is similar, as low as $29 per megawatt-hour with a midpoint of $60. 
- **Gas combined** cycle plant has a midpoint cost of $77 per megawatt-hour. 

The only recent U.S. data point for new nuclear, Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4, has a realized cost of approximately $190 per megawatt-hour. So finances from out our most recent reactor build shows costs that are more than three times more expensive than new solar and wind. It doesn't seem like SMRs will be cheaper. The Department of Energy itself modeled a median cost per megawatt that was over 50% higher for SMRs than for large reactors

Even when you account for grid stability using a Levelized Full System Cost of Electricity model, the system cost for renewables in Texas is around $97 per megawatt-hour, which is nearly identical to nuclear at $96. This model assumes only 5% firm backup power, but the U.S. grid already has about 25% firm capacity from existing nuclear and hydropower, which makes this a pessimistic scenario for renewables. It seems likely that wind and solar are far cheaper than nuclear even when using this full system cost model.

&nbsp;

**2: Poor Track Record:**

 On top of this, the nuclear industry has a consistent, international record of severe budget and schedule overruns, which makes it hard to believe claims that SMRs will be delivered on time and on budget. 

For example, Plant Vogtle in the U.S. was originally estimated at $14 billion for completion in 2016 or 2017, but it was finally finished in 2023-2024 at a cost of around $35 billion. That's a 150% cost overrun and a seven-year delay. Ratepayers in Georgia will pay an extra $7.6 billion for it. Also, after completion, Vogtle Unit 3 was offline for 9.5 of its first 48 weeks. 

It's not just a U.S. problem either. The Flamanville-3 reactor in France began in 2007 with a €3.3 billion budget and a 2012 completion date, but it was finished in 2024 with a final cost of €13.2 billion - a 300% overrun and a twelve-year delay. An official audit even places the total cost at €19.1 billion. This pattern seems to be holding for existing SMRs. 

The world's only three operating SMRs, two in Russia and one in China, had cost overruns of 300% to 400%. An SMR in Argentina has a 700% cost overrun. China's first SMR took 12 years to build instead of the planned 4, and its second one is projected to cost twice as much per megawatt as a large reactor.

The flagship SMR project in the U.S., NuScale's Carbon Free Power Project, failed before construction even began because of unsustainable costs. It was terminated in November 2023 because its power was just too expensive for utilities to buy. The construction cost estimate for the 462 MW plant increased by 75%, from $5.3 billion in 2021 to $9.3 billion in 2023. 

The capital cost per kilowatt rose to over $20,000, which is comparable to the much larger Plant Vogtle. The target price for NuScale's electricity surged by 53%, from $58 per megawatt-hour to an unmarketable $89, and that was even with a $1.4 billion subsidy from the Department of Energy. 

Projections for other SMR designs look even worse. JP Morgan estimates some Western SMRs may cost $15 to $20 million per megawatt. Bill Gates estimated his 375 MW Natrium reactor would cost close to $10 billion, which is nearly $30 million per megawatt - double the per-megawatt cost of Vogtle.

&nbsp;

**3: Waste and Liabilities** 

Contrary to some of the marketing claims, it seems SMRs will actually produce significantly more radioactive waste per unit of energy than large reactors. A 2022 Stanford University study found that due to greater neutron leakage in small cores, SMRs will magnify the existing nuclear waste problem. The study suggests SMR designs will increase the total volume of nuclear waste requiring disposal by a factor of 2 to 30. They would also generate at least nine times more neutron-activated steel than conventional plants per unit of energy. On top of that, after 10,000 years, the radiotoxicity of the spent fuel from the SMRs studied would be at least 50% higher per unit of energy compared to conventional fuel.

This new, more complex waste would be added to a global stockpile of 400,000 metric tons of spent fuel, which is growing by over 11,000 tons annually, for which no country has a permanent disposal solution. The U.S. alone has over 88,500 metric tons of spent fuel stored at 75 sites across 33 states, and that number grows by 2,000 tons per year. There are other liabilities and risks to consider as well. Nuclear plants consume a lot of water, somewhere between 500 and 800 gallons per megawatt-hour. In contrast, solar PV uses only 2 to 20 gallons for cleaning, and wind turbines use virtually none. 

There are also massive unfunded cleanup costs. The global unfunded liability for decommissioning energy assets is $7.5 trillion. In the U.S., the failure to create a permanent waste repository has already cost taxpayers $5.3 billion in reimbursements to utilities for on-site storage, with future liability projected to be between $29 billion and $50 billion. Stranded assets from early plant closures could add another $60 billion in liabilities. The SMR supply chain also seems fragile and dependent on foreign nations. Over 90% of U.S. uranium fuel is imported, and there are no significant domestic suppliers for key materials like Hafnium, Niobium, and Nickel. 

Lastly, when you look at where major data centers are (Northern Virginia, Phoenix, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago), these aren't in the middle of nowhere; they are major urban areas. Do you think there won't be massive NIMBYism and regulatory efforts to halt small nuclear plants in these areas? 

&nbsp;

**4: I Just Dont get it**

When you look at the market, it seems SMRs are a non-competitive technology being outpaced by cheaper, faster, and more scalable solutions. From 2011 to 2021, the world added 56 gigawatts of nuclear capacity. In the single year of 2023, the world added 510 gigawatts of renewable capacity. For 2024, renewables accounted for 92.5% of all new global power capacity, and for 2025, solar, wind, and batteries represent 93% of planned U.S. utility-scale capacity additions. 0% is nuclear.

Nuclear's share of global power generation peaked at 17% in the mid-1990s and fell to 9.1% by 2024. If projections hold, solar will generate more electricity than nuclear by next year. Meanwhile things like advanced geothermal are projected to provide baseload power at a capital cost of $4,500 per kilowatt by 2030, eroding the nuclear is the only scalable renewable baseload argument.

However, the severe financial fragility introduces substantial risk, making this a low-confidence good buy driven purely by potential future drug approval and commercialization.” - AI tool I’ve been using

I think this could potentially be an insane return, it’s a very risky play but putting some money into the stock could pay off heavily.

Has anyone studied Free Cash Flow Yield? What is the general principle for a benchmark or a range that is attractive? Terry Smith has a video explaining his firm's philosophy here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiZQqe-3RKA&pp=ygUUZnJlZSBjYXNoIGZsb3cgeWllbGQ%3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiZQqe-3RKA&pp=ygUUZnJlZSBjYXNoIGZsb3cgeWllbGQ%3D)

Obivously you can never look at one metric and everything needs to be in context, for example if a company is heavily levered most of that free cash flow yield should be reserved for debt repayments while a low levered company cash either distribute back to shareholders or re-invest into the business. I really enjoy looking at simply Debt/Free Cash Flow.

1nnxe6i,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 16:19:30,Intel’s Nvidia Lifeline - Desperate Wager or Stroke of Genius?,"The big news is the alliance between Intel and NVIDIA. NVIDIA is pumping $5 billion into Intel, sending the stock soaring while AMD's took a hit. For Intel, it's a desperately needed lifeline into the AI data centre space. For NVIDIA, it's a strategic hedge against relying solely on Taiwan's TSMC and a way to win political points with Washington. AMD is now caught in the crossfire, facing a new competitor attacking it on both the CPU and GPU fronts.

But this deal doesn't fix Intel's core problem: its grand plan to become a contract chip maker (a ""foundry"") is in deep trouble. The company's own SEC filings bluntly admit they have been ""unsuccessful to date in attracting significant customers"".

So, everything now hinges on one massive bet: their next-generation 18A manufacturing process. This tech is genuinely revolutionary, with new ""RibbonFET"" transistors and ""PowerVia"" backside power delivery that could, in theory, leapfrog TSMC's upcoming N2 node. Microsoft has given them a huge vote of confidence by signing on to use 18A, but the stakes couldn't be higher.

The bear case is terrifying: persistent rumours of alarmingly low manufacturing yields (some as low as 10%) could kill the entire strategy before it begins. Meanwhile, Intel is still bleeding market share to AMD in its core CPU business and is a distant third in the AI chip race, where NVIDIA's software moat is almost impossible to overcome.

My take? Investing in Intel today is a venture capital-style bet on a single, binary outcome. If they can execute flawlessly and get 18A working at scale by 2025, the stock is extraordinarily cheap. If they stumble, the decline could be terminal. It's a high-risk, high-reward play for the brave.

Financials show ~$500m revenue last year, solid cash on hand, but also dilution and ~$1b in convertibles. On trailing numbers, valuation looks expensive.

Mark Spitznagel’s hedge fund has earned bonanzas in market collapses

This is an online version of Spencer’s Markets A.M. newsletter. Get investing insights in your inbox each weekday by signing up here—it’s free.

Plenty of fund managers will tell you they’re really bullish about stocks. Try finding one who says so yet stands to make a killing if prices collapse.

“I’m the crash guy—I remain the crash guy,” says Mark Spitznagel, who earned $1 billion in a single day for his clients during 2015’s “Flash Crash.” A protégé of “Black Swan” author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, his hedge fund, Universa Investments, also scored major gains when Lehman collapsed and when Covid-19 sparked a meltdown.

The alarming part of Spitznagel’s current outlook is that he sees conditions akin to 1929, the year of the Wall Street crash. The silver lining for those hoping the bull-market music will keep playing a while longer: He thinks this is more like the early part of 1929 when stocks added significantly to their Roaring ’20s gains.

How excited—or worried—should ordinary investors be? Take a deep breath and understand the way Spitznagel made those past killings. He wasn’t reading the tea leaves and predicting the timing of stock swoons. Even the smartest trader couldn’t know a pandemic or trading glitch was coming. Universa buys so-called tail-risk protection that loses money most of the time and then pays off hugely if a downturn is particularly sharp.

Other successful fund managers have drawn public attention with similar calls, and they occasionally get them right. In July 2024 Spitznagel himself sounded a similar tune, predicting “something really, really bad,” but with a last hurrah for stocks first. The S&P 500 has gained 23% since 

Market timing is notoriously difficult and often costly for individual investors who shift their portfolios on fearful headlines—something Spitznagel pointedly doesn’t recommend. Individuals who can’t buy sophisticated tail-risk protection will still make attractive returns in the long run as long as they can hang on. Many don’t.

“The biggest risk to investors isn’t the market—it’s themselves,” he says.

Timing aside, the euphoric and then cataclysmic scenario Spitznagel is describing could be good for his particular strategy. When investors are optimistic, his fund can purchase exotic tail-risk derivatives cheaply. His clients, mostly traditional investors such as pension funds, pay for protection so that they can more confidently reap the full benefit of rising markets.

The reason Spitznagel thinks the current bull market’s comeuppance could be the worst since 1929 is repeated federal rescues of markets and the economy. He compares it to the practice of quickly extinguishing forest fires only to have too much dry tinder accumulate. Amid today’s near-record stock valuations, the eventual “firebomb” could burn 

Before that happens, though, he calls conditions such as Federal Reserve rate cuts ideal for the market to push higher, with the S&P 500 hitting 8000 points fairly quickly. That would be a 20% gain from today’s level.

If a major selloff really is just over the horizon, big gains now wouldn’t be unusual. Since 1980, the S&P 500 has returned an impressive 26% annualized in the 12 months preceding the start of a bear market. The final 12 months’ rally was more than twice as high as that average ahead of the 1929 peak.

Both individual and professional investors tend to increase their stock exposure at times like today. Strategists at State Street noted last month that institutional investors’ exposure to equities just reached its highest since November 2007, just before a vicious bear market. American households’ allocation to stocks is also at a record, surpassing tech-bubble levels.

Two other signs that investors are throwing caution to the wind: The premium investors require to own investment-grade-rated bonds hit its lowest since 1998 on Friday and trading volume on U.S. stock exchanges was just shy of the April record during the Liberation Day panic.

“The markets are perverse,” says Spitznagel. “They exist to screw people.”

1nnmqwm,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 09:38:43,The great ammunition liquidation has ended (plus one more investment theme to start the week),"Note: formatting is much better on the website.

\---

# Theme 1: Ammunition Industry Pricing Power Returns After Historic 2025 Collapse

**News:** Kinetic Group, owner of Federal, CCI, Speer, Remington, and other major ammunition brands, announced substantial price increases of 3-12% across all ammunition categories effective October 1, 2025, citing rising costs of brass, lead, antimony, and propellants.

**Investment Thesis:** The first major ammunition price increase announcement signals the end of 2025's historic price collapse, creating margin recovery opportunities for manufacturers after months of unsustainable pricing.

The ammunition market experienced an unprecedented collapse throughout 2025, with 9mm rounds falling 75% from pandemic highs to just 20 cents per round, and current prices sitting 35% below pre-pandemic 2019 levels. This dramatic decline was driven by oversupply from pre-tariff imports, reduced post-election demand, and economic pressures on consumer spending.

Kinetic Group's announcement represents a fundamental shift in market dynamics. When the largest player in the ammunition market implements broad-based price increases, it typically sets the tone for industry-wide pricing adjustments. The company's rationale of rising raw material costs suggests that the artificial oversupply conditions are normalizing.

The timing creates additional advantages for manufacturers, as they can sell existing lower-cost inventory at higher prices while benefiting from the approaching hunting season demand. With warehouses currently full and retailers heavily discounting to clear inventory, this price increase signals that the liquidation phase may be ending.

**Stocks that would benefit:**

• `SWBI`: Smith & Wesson Brands Inc - While primarily known for firearms, Smith & Wesson has strategically diversified into ammunition production to capture more of the shooting sports ecosystem. The company is uniquely positioned to benefit from ammunition price normalization through both direct margin improvement in its ammunition segment and increased firearm sales as ammunition becomes more affordable, encouraging more frequent shooting and training. Smith & Wesson's vertically integrated business model allows it to capitalize on both sides of the market recovery, with its strong brand recognition driving consumer loyalty across product categories during this pricing inflection point. 

• `RGR`: Sturm, Ruger & Company Inc - As a pure-play firearms manufacturer with a debt-free balance sheet, Ruger stands to benefit significantly from the normalization of ammunition prices through increased firearm demand. When ammunition becomes more affordable, consumers typically increase their shooting activities, driving both new gun purchases and replacement cycles. Ruger's recent strategic product innovations, including versatile platforms like the RXM pistol and successful Marlin lever-action rifles, position the company to capture increased consumer spending as the ammunition price barrier to shooting sports participation decreases, directly supporting the pricing power recovery thesis. 

# Theme 2: EV Charging Infrastructure Gains Momentum from Wood Mackenzie's Bullish 12.3% Growth Forecast

**News:** Wood Mackenzie released comprehensive research projecting global EV charging ports will expand at a 12.3% compound annual growth rate from 2026 through 2040, reaching 206.6 million ports worldwide, with annual infrastructure investment growing 8% annually to $300 billion by 2040.

**Investment Thesis:** EV charging infrastructure companies are entering a sustained expansion cycle driven by improving utilization economics and U.S. market outperformance expectations of 14% annual growth through 2040.

The Wood Mackenzie forecast validates long-term business models across the charging ecosystem, particularly highlighting that the ratio of EVs to public chargers will improve from 7.5 vehicles per charger in 2025 to 14.2 in 2040. This utilization improvement directly addresses previous investor concerns about charging network economics and return on invested capital.

The U.S. market specifically is projected to outpace global growth, reaching 475,000 ports and generating $3.3 billion in annual market value by 2040. This domestic outperformance creates particular advantages for American-listed charging infrastructure companies.

Residential charging dominance continues with 133 million ports expected globally by 2040, representing two-thirds of all installations through 2050, supporting companies focused on Level 2 residential solutions alongside public fast-charging networks.

**Stocks that would benefit:**

• `EVGO`: EVgo Inc - Positioned as a pure-play beneficiary of the improving EV charging economics highlighted in the Wood Mackenzie forecast, particularly the projected increase in the ratio of EVs to public chargers from 7.5 to 14.2 by 2040. EVgo's strategic focus on high-power DC fast charging in urban and suburban locations directly aligns with the projected 14% annual growth in the U.S. market. The company's recent non-dilutive financing, including a $1.25 billion DOE loan and $225 million commercial bank facility, provides the capital needed to expand its public stall count to approximately 14,000 by 2029, capturing significant market share during this growth phase. EVgo's joint development of next-generation charging architecture with Delta Electronics, targeting a 30% reduction in gross CapEx per stall, further enhances its ability to benefit from the projected market expansion. 

• `BLNK`: Blink Charging Co - Uniquely positioned to capitalize on both the residential and commercial charging expansion projected in the Wood Mackenzie report through its vertically integrated business model. The company's strategic shift toward a higher-margin, recurring service revenue model emphasizes ownership and operation of charging assets, particularly DC fast chargers, which aligns perfectly with the forecast's emphasis on improving utilization economics. Blink's proprietary network technology and vertical integration capabilities enable it to enhance operational performance and improve station economics as the market expands. The company's recent 35% year-over-year growth in charging service revenue demonstrates increasing utilization and network expansion, directly supporting the thesis that charging economics will improve as EV adoption accelerates.

• `CHPT`: ChargePoint Holdings - Offers comprehensive charging solutions across residential, commercial, and fleet segments, making it a diversified play on the projected expansion across all charging environments. The company's software platform and hardware innovations are particularly well-positioned to benefit from the forecast's projection that residential charging will represent two-thirds of all installations through 2050. ChargePoint's strategic partnerships with companies like Eaton and General Motors accelerate product development and expand market reach, particularly for advanced energy management solutions like bidirectional charging. The company's record non-GAAP gross margin of 33% demonstrates improving economics that align with the Wood Mackenzie forecast's projection of better utilization rates and return on invested capital for charging infrastructure.

1nnmapb,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 09:20:03,Is catalyst pharmaceutical a good value buy?,"
Been looking at Catalyst Pharma (CPRX) and ran it through my scoring model. Came out pretty strong (84/100). Quick breakdown: All data from stock analysis.com

What looks good:

Margins are insane → ~83% gross, 37% net. 

ROIC ~21% → solid efficiency.

Zero debt + $650m cash → balance sheet is rock solid.

Free cash flow margin ~49% → very rare for a small biotech.

EPS growth forecast ~26% over 5 years.

Analysts are bullish → avg PT around $33 (that’s ~+68% upside).

Patent protection on their main drug (Firdapse) extended until 2035.


What bothers me:

PEG ratio ~1.3 → not dirt cheap anymore.

Revenue growth forecast is only ~11% → not huge 🤔

Still heavily dependent on one drug → if anything goes wrong, revenue takes a hit.

Generic/legal risk always a cloud in pharma.

Execution risk with their newer drugs (AGAMREE, FYCOMPA).


My view:
CPRX feels like a proper cash cow with limited downside, but the growth story depends on them scaling beyond Firdapse. If there's no future successful drugs released, you’ve basically bought into a super profitable but not fast-growing rare-disease niche.

Curious if anyone else is in CPRX",3,4,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nnmapb/is_catalyst_pharmaceutical_a_good_value_buy/,new,Discussion,1.0

1nnk79x,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 07:44:34,Why Japanese Real Estate Small Caps Might Be the Best Value in Global Markets Right Now,"The Japanese stock market has finally climbed back to the highs it set during one of the largest financial bubbles in history (the 1980s). After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

⸻

Bottom line:
Japanese real estate small caps are a rare mix of hyper-growth, low valuations, insider ownership, and secular tailwinds.

1nnh3jp,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 04:40:37,The grain trader that’s hated right now (ADM),"I am talking about Archer Daniel Midland, one of the largest grain and soft commodity traders out there. This stock has taken a beating the last 2 years, when it had an investigation into accounting practices and suspended their CFO. Things have not looked good for their stock price since. However, their cashflows have been very solid in the last few years and this is why I suggest there might be value in this stock. As of today, the market cap is roughly 80 billion USD.

Firstly, their business model mainly consists of procurement, storage, blending and transportation of oilseeds and grains as well as crushing them into meal and oil products. These two pillars are accounting for two thirds of their profits. The rest is refinement and distribution of bulk and package food oils and biodiesel and a 22% ownership Wilmar that has a diversified portfolio and is accounted for at equity. Their processing plants are mainly in the US. According to CSI Market, their market share depending on the product is somewhere between 30-40%. Their operating margins however are quite low, since they are a trader and not a producer, they dont own the farm land. So you will see a low margin in their business and volatility in their earnings depending on the underlying price movements. Their moat is their sheer size and the cost efficiencies they can achieve compared to the competition.

From their financials, I think this company draws a different picture than their stock price suggests. Their operating cashflow has been massive in the latest quarter at 4 billion USD, which is very solid compared to total assets of around 50 billion USD. They generated good cashflow over the last 3 years with consistent quarterly cashflows in the region of 1-3 billion USD, the only quarter being negative back in March 2023.

Looking at the balance sheet, they do have liabilities (the business is capital intensive to some degree, to buy machinery etc.), but they have a very healthy level of equity. As for shares outstanding, they have constantly decreased over the last quarters as well as over the last 10 years, to me a good sign that you wont get diluted.

Overall, the cashflows can be a bit over the place and sensitive to macro events, i think this is still a player to keep in mind, given the discount the stock price has compared to a few years back.

Insider trades do give some mixed signals, since the CFO has sold some shares a few months back worth 1.3 MUSD (see below), but this does not have me worried too much.

For this analysis I used charts over the quarterly and annual financial results (balance sheet, income statement, cashflow statement and shares outstanding) that are official submissions to the SEC and i have obtained them through [www.Stock-Ticker-News.com](http://www.Stock-Ticker-News.com)

1nn08ij,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 14:52:51,$ALT. Many catalysts create a favorable risk/reward setup... (A Write Up),"**Disclosure:**  
First off, I want to be clear, I did use ChatGPT to help me reword and structure this write-up. **This is not “AI slop.”** I’ve done my own due diligence on $ALT, reviewed the trial data, filings, and peer comparisons. I merely used it as a tool for formatting and clarity. Also, **I do have a position in $ALT** and recommend you do your own due diligence before investing.

**Thesis**

Altimmune ($ALT) with its lead asset **permvidutide** is delivering on multiple ways in **obesity**, MASH (metabolic associated steatohepatitis), and liver disease. The recent 24-week data, non-invasive (NIT) improvements, regulatory developments, tolerability profile, obesity weight loss, recent management additions, and high short interest all create a short-term favorable risk/reward setup which should play out within the next year (when 48 week data releases end of this year/early next year). Also an **incredible opportunity for an acquisition**. 



**1. Mechanism & Design**

Pemvidutide is a GLP-1 / glucagon dual agonist engineered with Altimmune's EuPort domain. This deisng extends its half-life, reduces peak exposure, which enables therapeutic doses (1.2 mg, 1.8 mg) to be used without titration, improving usability for patients and physicians.

**(Simplified)** It's like Ozempic but built better - it lasts longer, its smoother on the body, and doesn't slow dose increases. 



**2. 24-Week MASH Data**

In the IMPACT Phase 2b trial, pemvidutide achieved MASH resolution without worsening fibrosis in       52-59% of patients vs \~19% placebo (p<0.0001). Fibrosis improvements trended positive (32-35% vs 25% placebo) but wasn't statistically significant at 24 weeks. 

**(Simplified)** After 6 months, more than half the patients had their liver disease clear up, compared to only 1 in 5 on placebo. Scarring wasn't improved enough yet, but it looks to be moving in the right direction. 



**3. Non-Invasive Tests (NITs)**

Significant improvements were seen on non-invasive fibrosis and liver-stiffness measures (VCTE, ELF), consistent with FDA's move to recognize VCTE as a ""reasonably likely"" surrogate endpoint. 

**(Simplified)** Scans and blood tests showed the drug was working. The FDA now says these kinds of scans can count as proof of a drug works.



**4. Weight Loss in the MASH Trial**  

At 24 weeks, pemvidutide delivered \~5-6% mean weight loss without titration, with body weight still declining at the last observation.

**(Simplified)** People lost about 5-6% of their body weight in 6 months - and they were still losing more when the study ended. 

  


**5. Safety & Tolerability** 

Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were <1% on pemvidutide, lower than placebo. EuPort design may contribute to reduced GI side effects.

**(Simplified)** Almost nobody quit because of side effects - actually fewer than those on placebo. 



**6. Obesity Program (MOMENTUM)**

In obesity, Phase 2, 2.4 mg pemvitutide produced 15.6% mean weight loss at 48 weeks with minimal titration. Lean mass loss was \~22% of weight lost, while visceral fat reduction was \~28%, outperforming subcutaneous loss and looking favorable vs other GLP-1s. 

**(Simplified)**  In a year-long obesity trial, patients lost about 16% of their weight. Most of that was fat, especially belly fat, and they kept more muscle compared to other weight-loss drugs. 

  


**7. Pipeline Expansion**  
Altimmune has initiated Phase 2 studies of pemvidutide in Alcohol Use Disorder (heavy drinking days) and Alchohol-Associated Liver Disease (endpoint: VCTE at 24 weeks). 

**(Simplified)** The drug is also being tested to help people drink less and to treat alcohol-related liver disease. 

  


**8. Valuation & Peer Context**  
Altimmune's valuation (\~$330M market cap, \~$170M EV) remains anomalously low compared with peers, especially following Roche's $2.4B acquistion of 89bio. 

**(Simplified)** Self explanatory...  




**9. Regulatory/Surrogate Endpoints**

FDA's acceptance of a Letter of Intent to qualify VCTE as the first non-invasive surrogate endpoint ""reasonably likely to predict benefit"" enhance the regulatory pathway for pemvidutide. 

**(Simplified)** The FDA now allows certain scans to be used as proof in trials, which makes Altimmune's results even more valuable. 

  


**10. Short Interest Details**

Shares sold short \~26.77 millions shares 

Short % of flat \~30.55-31.7%

This is high short interest. It means many are betting against ALT, which could amplify volatility around catalysts like data readouts, regulatory decisions, earnings. 

  


**11. New Management**

Altimmune appointed Linda M. Richardson as Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), effective September 16, 2025. Richardson brings over 30 years of commerical leadership across metabolic disease, hepatology, cardiovascular, and addiction medicine, with prior C-suite experience at Intercept and senior roles at Sanofi. The timing of this is pivotal 48-week MASH data readout and Phase 3 planning and signals that Altimmune is preparing for commercial execution. Hiring a CCO at this stage suggests confidence in trial outcomes, intent to scale infrastructure for Phase 3, and a focus on market access and launch strategy. 

  
Hope you all enjoyed and recommend you do your own DD before making any financial decision.

1nm5s9p,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 14:31:31,Unprofitable stocks are often the BEST value plays.,"I see a lot of people write off companies the second they see **“unprofitable.”** But that seems foolish to me.

Often when a company is unprofitable, the stock looks insanely overvalued on traditional metrics. But *IF* it has a clear path to profitability it might be a good buy. As once profits start coming in, suddenly valuation looks “reasonable.” Therefore the stock rerates higher.

**Examples:**

* PLTR
* HIMS
* UBER
* CVNA
* HOOD
* SOFI
* SHOP
* (and probably more)

All were ""expensive"" when the stock was unprofitable. But after profitability they got rerated higher.

Obviously most unprofitable companies never make it and burn capital forever. **That's why I believe if I were to bet on an unprofitable company it'll be software companies.** As they're highly scalable and are the most likely to do a profitability turnaround. And they're profits need to be heading up.

**Curious how this sub views it:**

Is this outside of value investing, or is it value?

And what are your unprofitable plays?",0,39,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nm5s9p/unprofitable_stocks_are_often_the_best_value_plays/,new,Discussion,0.34

One can say they’re just looking for good deals in the market. Either by ownership, or lending. They understand that the market is valued correctly in the long term, hence in the short term there are discrepancies, or gaps in the market, that they can take advantage of in many shapes or form. But there are two main components that play a key role.


The price the investor buys at, and the value they approximately predict of the security they are buying. Typically the intrinsic value, the bet on future earnings based on the assets tangible and intangible of the present. The assets a business owns will be the primary driver of growth and earnings, and an investor main goal is to find securities that have assets that provide strong earning powers in the future. This is the value, now in the short term, investor sentiment, aka the optimism or pessimism of “Mr. Market” is in constant fluctuations. So the intrinsic value and the present day price of the security often do not correspond. And some are seriously undervalued, those provide a margin of safety, with a significant discount rate. This is the ideal security an investor wants and hunts for.",2,4,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nln59x/why_value_investing_is_fundamentally_market_price/,new,Discussion,0.75

Is it value investing to invest in unorthodox companies that are surviving crisis, bankruptcy, restructuration, and very shaky past ?  
  
In Brazil there are some companies that although are or were in huge crisis, they have some good value, like:

* Light Company: It's the electrical company of Rio de Janeiro, it was in our Chapter 11 and judicial recovery, it had a huge debt, it's also well known in the market that 60% of the energy generated and transmitted by the company is hotwired and stolen by the inhabitants, pratically they are a joke amongst the people. Nevertheless, today they are in a very better situation, their leverage is good compared to other electrical companies, they have some good cash flow, big shots of the market investing, Small P/E, and the energy supply of the entire Rio de Janeiro State, but the market is still undervaluing the stock. 
* Lojas Americanas: It's our Dollar General, and punchline of hundreds of jokes amongst the population, due to it's recent fraud scandal, judicial recovery, litigations, stories of shoplifting, etc However the owners (3g Capital of AbInbev, BurgerKing) were forced to captalize and save the company. today the company is still recovering, but there is some potential like: personal intervention of the owners (Mr Sicupira, Lemann and Telles), small debt, huge capital injection, a reducing loss, and it's huge presence in Brazil's Retail and logistics, that still provide them competitive advantage in the sale of snacks, underwear, electronics, alongside digital presence, and a possibility of interest rate reducing in the future. Although the company is a meme stock in the stock market.
* Magalu: it's our Best Buy+IKEA, and the main Amazon + Mercado Livre rival in the country, it was in a bad shape last years, it also got in trouble with our basic interest rate, and debt, it's stock plummeted. However it seems to be back on the track, they are recovering from losses, their debt is also reduced, they have huge cash flow, are a HUGE brand in the market, their logistics is second to none, they are also undervalued in regards to their equity, and believe or not the company is diversifying in the cloud sector.

1nl8pby,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 12:45:00,I believe this is the most future proof mine I've ever found,"
Alright listen up gang, I’ve found a beat down stock but what I think is a sure hit for mid to long term investors.  FPX nickel is building the largest nickel mine in north American, top 10 in the world.

To break this down, here’s a few of the key bull points

-The ore does not require acid extraction, it uses magnets (fucken magnets, how do they work?)

-The ore type means is low carbon footprint, low tailings, and low metallurgical cost, it’s a simple extraction method. Low carbon is favorable as  future proofed mine. The capital cost per extraction is quite ideal

-it’s in BC Canada which is favorable for mining, good port access and intercontinental sales

-It can be processed as either high grade nickel for stainless steel, or pushed to battery grade nickel sulphate

-They received $3.5 million CAD from the Canadian government to support construction. This is not a loan, literally just free money to the company

-They have three separate companies who all have bought a share in FPX and all the company’s have a cost basis of around 40 to 50 cents (share price is 30 cents now)

-They have preliminary agreements with Toyota and panasonic, Japan’s metal and energy security agency, and Prime planet energy & solutions to supply materials for EV construction (non binding). These will align the industries for future partnerships, funding agreements, and general support overseas

-It’s mine life is 29 years.
 
What’s the downside and risk?
It’s early stages, Environmental assessments have been happening since 2022, but permitting might take as long as 2027. Nickel might not be sold until as late as 2030


So with that said, this is a long term investment. Dont expect fast returns and big moves soon, but for the patient investor, this could really pay off

1nkz7ha,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 05:46:57,"Malibu Life Holdings (LON:MLHL) Trading at Huge Discount. Price $20, Book $33+.","Malibu Life Holdings (LON:MLHL) used to be that Third Point Investors Limited was just one of those London-listed closed end funds that gave you exposure to Dan Loeb’s hedge fund strategy via a feeder structure. It traded at a persistent discount to its net asset value, leaving a lot of investors frustrated. Recently, it pivoted with a reverse takeover and transformed itself into an operating reinsurer focused on US fixed annuities. That’s the change. The upcoming opportunity lies in how that restructured business can begin to deliver growth, profits, and get re-rated by the market.

As of now, the volume of shares traded have taken a nosedive since the reverse take over given the reassessment taking place by all institution investors. Furthermore, the company has yet to release it's first quarterly and annual reports since the merger, however, based on the financials reported during the reverse takeover, we can work somethings out. In addition to this, liquidity has also been impacted by the scheduled redemption of 4.38 million shares on 19 September 2025, with initial cash consideration paid that day. After the redemption the free float drops to roughly 17 million shares, which has further thinned day-to-day volumes and made price discovery more volatile. The redemption also took place at a slight discount, meaning the NAV per share should slightly tick up, but we can ignore that bit for now.

The latest numbers tell us that the reference NAV per ordinary share is about \~$33 as of the last disclosure date. The company’s share price is currently trading near $20-21 depending on market moves. The tangible book value of Malibu Life Reinsurance (the acquired business) is roughly US$65-68 million. However, since this was an NAV-to-NAV deal, this won't impact the PB per share.

Putting those together, the implied book value (NAV) per share is $33, while the market is paying around $20. That means the shares are trading at about a 40-45% discount to book value (or NAV). That is a large margin of safety if the book value is sound, and if the reinsurance business can begin to show results.

Risks remain. Execution risk is high: building up premium volume, managing reserves, ensuring profitability in the reinsurance of US fixed annuities is not trivial. Regulatory risk exists if oversight or capital requirements change. There is also the possibility the discount persists or widens if the market is skeptical of management, of the reinsurance strategy, or if early operating results are weak. Liquidity and investor sentiment matter.

Assuming the business executes reasonably well, sells enough treaties or annuity blocks, and begins to deliver mid-teens returns on equity (the stated target), one can model a re-rating of the share price over a 1-2 year horizon. If today’s NAV is \~$33 and the market is paying \~$20, the discount will need to narrow substantially for the share price to catch up. If discount narrows to, say, 10-15%, that alone gives \~25-30% upside (to \~$28-30). Add in NAV growth from earnings (assuming 10-15% ROE, growth in premium base, operational leverage) and you might see NAV rise to perhaps \~$36-40 in 12-24 months. Combined with discount compression that gives a potential price target in the ballpark of US$32-$40 per share.

Given that, a fair one-to-two year price target I would propose is US$35 per share under base case, US$40 per share if execution is strong and re-rating occurs.",52,3,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkz7ha/malibu_life_holdings_lonmlhl_trading_at_huge/,new,Stock Analysis,0.97

* I'm relatively a newborn in stockmarket and value investing, effectively starting in late september of last year. And i started very bad, investing on **NVDA** bubble and quitting once i got the opportunity, and i learned more about the market,  fundamental attributes, fundamental analysis.
* I'm in a very *sui generis* market, the brazilian one, where the stock market is underinvested and a bit smaller than the american one, the investors are either too skeptical or too optimistical, with elephant companies with very low P/E ratio, healthy finances and big fat dividends (like 15% in some banks, oil, mining).
* Since NVDA i've been building a small portifolio, following the principles of: absolute frugality in the stock price (small P/E like Vale and Petrobras), very good growth prospects, no bubbles nor Rallies, undervalued good companies (like Oil, Insurance, Banks), that suffered devaluation due to market rumors, bad season and the infamous tariffs.
* I avoided to buy NVO, due to lack of time to study, fear of catching a falling Knive, the targeting of Ozempic Patents by brazilian and world pharma (lots of companies are crazy to make their own, it's going to be a fever here, unfortunately lots of the producers are private)
* I also avoided Google, due to the worsening of the flagship product (search platform), bullish approach to AI, the fierce competion in cloud providers, the insane approach of US government, the recession on the radar, and a P/E of 25
* Nonetheless, NVO is starting to get impulse and is a nice company to invest (their brand is differential).
* And Google even though i disagree with some choices, they have Youtube (This itself is a huge product, a monopoly), Google, Waymo, GCP, and strong R&D

A rally is forming about these two companies, in a market that is craving to buy the deep and is almost bubble generator,  
And i'm thinking about getting a few shares of NVO and GOOGL, but i'm afraid of paying a very expensive price, what's the best approach to this case ?

What I have noticed is they usually give conservative guidance on how much they expect to grow, and I have them doing 15% revenue growth over the next 5 years on average.

## CONCLUSION & VERIFICATION SUMMARY

### Macro Regime Classification
**Primary Regime:** TRANSITIONING (EXPANSION → SLOWDOWN)
**Confidence Level:** HIGH
**Expected Duration:** 6-9 months
**Key Supporting Evidence:**
1. Fed pivot to easing with first rate cut
2. Labor market deterioration (NFP miss, rising unemployment)
3. Yield curve normalization after extended inversion

### Executive Summary
**One-Line Synthesis:** The macro environment is transitioning from late-cycle expansion to early slowdown, with the Fed initiating an easing cycle that should provide selective opportunities in duration and quality risk assets while warranting caution on cyclical exposures.

### Highest Conviction Calls

1. **Long Investment Grade Bonds**
   - Supporting data: 4%+ yields with Fed easing, tight spreads
   - Implementation: Overweight IG via LQD or individual bonds
   - Risk: Spread widening if recession materializes

2. **Overweight Quality Growth Equities**
   - Supporting data: Rate cuts historically benefit growth, strong fundamentals
   - Implementation: Technology and healthcare sector ETFs
   - Risk: Valuation compression if rates rise unexpectedly

3. **Reduce Cyclical Exposure**
   - Supporting data: ISM <50, weak NFP, global growth concerns
   - Implementation: Underweight energy, materials, industrials
   - Risk: Positive economic surprise could cause underperformance

### Key Risks to Monitor
1. **Inflation reacceleration:** Trigger at CPI >3.5%, currently at 2.9%
2. **Credit event:** Trigger at HY spreads >450bps, currently at 283bps
3. **Labor market breakdown:** Trigger at unemployment >4.5%, currently at 4.3%

### Next Update Requirements
- **Scheduled Update:** October 18, 2025
- **Conditional Update:** If Fed makes inter-meeting move or CPI >3.5%
- **Emergency Update:** If VIX >30 or credit spreads blow out >100bps

Fundamentals (Ok - kinda solid): Good balance sheet (solid liquidity ratios + recovering solvency such as debt ratios), not great but ok looking income statement (EBITDA&net profit margin still trying to recover + still decreasing ROIC and ROE but still solid numbers), Cashflow statement doesn't look too great but I can see they are (1. laying low on CAPEX just maintaining and not investing into PPE; 2. Paying back shareholders) - exactly what a mature stage company should do. So overall, the fundamentals don't look bad to me.

2. Overarching Headwind (Nothing to be feared): I think this headwind is nothing to be feared as its gonna pass. People needs their stuff shipped, simple as that. And the orange king won't be in power forever. ( so I have AMZN + FDX shares & sold puts on UPS)

3. Valuation: A solid business trading at 13x earnings is a no brainer to me.

My execution: I started a position with 10% of my NAV and plans to hold if it goes up or convert half into LEAPS if the earnings blew up.

The Golden Age of Value Investing Is Over

It used to take hard work and an ear for scuttlebutt to gain an edge, but now AI has leveled the playing field. Is that a bad thing? 

For 30 years, my advantage as an investor was painstaking research. AI just made it worthless.
In 1995, I read two books that changed my life: Benjamin Graham’s The Intelligent Investor and Roger Lowenstein’s biography of Warren Buffett. I was hooked on value investing. I could not get enough of it. In those days, however, getting enough of it was hard. It was the infancy of the internet, so it wasn’t as if I could just Google “Warren Buffett” or “value investing.”


The first thing I could get my hands on was Berkshire Hathaway’s annual report. I had to look up the phone number in the phone directory. After that, I placed a phone call using a landline. A nice lady with a Midwestern accent picked up the phone, “Berkshire Hathaway — how can I help you?”


“Hello,” I said. “I’d like to order a copy of your annual report.” That’ll be no problem, came the answer. I gave her my mailing address, and she repeated it back to me. A few days later, I received a brown envelope with the annual report. I devoured it. And I used the table of Berkshire’s publicly traded investments to go after new materials — the reports of Coca-Cola, Geico, American Express and Capital Cities/ABC — in a similar fashion, by picking up a landline phone and making a verbal request.
What’s my point?


Things went slowly. Acquiring knowledge was hard. Every step in the acquisition of investing knowledge involved a cycle of days, if not weeks. The various pieces had to be carefully assembled and assiduously harvested.


From those early days, I learned about the Berkshire Hathaway meetings. They were not recorded for YouTube or televised live. So, I acquired some shares and attended them in person. All in pursuit of an investing edge. Yes — there were a few lucky non-attendees of those meetings who managed to get onto Whitney Tilson’s famous email list — which at the time numbered dozens at most. But that was it. The inside tracks were few and far between.
Because I could not get enough, I also attended the Wesco meetings in Pasadena, California with Charlie Munger, and the Sequoia Fund meetings run by Bill Ruane and Rick Cunniff. Once at the Wesco meeting, Munger mentioned the Tupperware company in the context of Robert Cialdini’s Influence:The Psychology of Persuasion. I was on it. I even organized a Tupperware party in my home to understand how the company’s sales system worked.


In those days, potential investors in my fund used to ask, “What’s your edge?” Perhaps it was a shorthand for “Do you have a source of inside information?” Or, more politely, “What’s your variant insight?” If I had any at all, it was based on this sort of scuttlebutt.
But that world is now gone.


Over the last decade many of those advantages have been eroded. Pounding the pavement, smiling and dialing were no longer necessary. Because those hard-earned insights were being emailed, tweeted, livestreamed, YouTubed, podcasted and more. Yes, you still had to pick your sources. But there was so much more that was simply available at the tips of any analyst’s fingers.


And now comes AI. The way investment research changed in the internet age was glacially slow when compared to the earthquake that is LLMs. Before ChatGPT, you still had to have the patience to assemble and read through the mosaic of sources. Now you can just ask ChatGPT or Gemini to do all the trawling. An LLM can give an instant summary of all that has been said in the public domain about a company. And it can be instantly analyzed to provide the current state of wisdom on the topic.
Granted, the LLMs cannot, to the best of my knowledge, generate original thinking. But the path to original thoughts is so much shorter — and so much more accessible.


In past times, I used to make a point of traveling to the Kings Road in London on the off chance that Nick Sleep and Qais Zakaria of Nomad might treat me to a Cornish pasty along with some of their original thoughts. It was there that I first heard Nick talk about “scale economies shared.” Today there is no need for me to travel all that distance — unless I am only after the Cornish pasty and Nick and Zak’s fine company.


Why? So many original thoughts or variant opinions are available online and the LLMs can trawl through all of them — adding in and cross-referencing a mosaic of additional sources: social media posts, SEC filings and more. That material is all now public domain.


It’s true that there are still many nonpublic data sources that are not accessible by LLMs. But data tends to leak out via Scribd, Reddit, arXiv or social media. Even if that’s just metadata, it can be assembled effortlessly. Then a human like me can apply intuition and fact-check the sources to make sure the LLM is not hallucinating.


What does this mean for value investing?
My conclusion is that the golden age of value investing is well and truly over. Thanks to the LLMs, I have no need for a junior analyst: At a fraction of the cost, an LLM can do a far better job. And the era of the swashbuckling hedge fund manager — Michael Steinhardt, George Soros, Julian Robertson — is also gone.


Asset pricing will become more accurate. Hidden subtleties about a particular business that make it either better or worse than it appears will be more easily revealed. The return on better analysis and better insight will diminish because it will be available to all. The British scientist and writer Matt Ridley would liken this to the Red Queen effect: We can all run faster, but at the end of the day, we will all have access to the same LLMs. The dispersion of returns for active management has to reduce, clustering even closer to the index return, even for investors who don’t closet index.


People used to ask, “What’s your edge?”, but there is no edge anymore. At least, none that is obvious to me.


Where, then, will money flow? What remains are index funds and asset-gatherers like BlackRock. And what of small, independent boutique funds like mine? We can stick to human behaviors that work — which the indexers and the quant funds with their large organizations and programmed behavior cannot replicate. We can buy and hold, which is sometimes called time arbitrage.


I will certainly continue to invest in scuttlebutt, LLM channel checks, expert calls and the like. But I know that it will probably be futile. Because everyone can do it. I expect my attention to turn to building the best set of relationships, and to invest in businesses that themselves invest in better sets of relationships.
For this I can think of no better example than Berkshire Hathaway - with its vast number of shareholders. That's a large group who have the lived experience that buying and holding for the long term, rather than chopping and changing, is the way to invest. That will give Buffett's successor, Greg Abel, a far better environment to allocate capital - just as my investor base should afford me the same. I know it's slim pickings, but it should be enough for those of us who remain.


If the only thing AI and LLM's do for finance is to level the playing field - to further marginalize the masters of the universe (and wannabees like me) - would that be such a bad thing? Most likely not.


Thanks to AI, the playing field is more level than it's ever been. Now more than ever there is no need for the average investor to have to pay outrageous fees. A big benefit of the stock market was democratize finance. Perhaps, now, thanks to AI, that day is finally here.",79,76,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkmlfe/the_golden_age_of_value_investing_is_over_guy/,new,Discussion,0.9
1nkmjao,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 18:33:13,Analysis of IREN - second update,"Hi everyone,



Some of you might remember [my previous discussion about IREN when it was trading at $18 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1mnyhsk/analysis_of_iren_an_undervalue_company_for_now/)a month ago. With recent price movements, I wanted to share an updated analysis and get your perspectives.

Current snapshot (Sept 18, 2025):

* Trading at $36.60
* Market cap: $9.968B

**My 2026 Projections:**

Looking at their monthly reports from January through August 2025, I'm conservatively estimating they'll generate $60M in hardware profit monthly starting January 2026.

Annual gross hardware profit: 12 × $60M = $720M

They're targeting $200-250M in GPU service revenue annually. While no contracts are announced yet, partnerships seem likely based on recent industry trends. Assuming 10% for electricity and operating costs:

Annual gross GPU service profit: $180-225M

Total gross annual profit: $900-945M

**Scenario Analysis:**

**Scenario 1: BTC around $115,000**

Converting gross profit to net income (after all costs, taxes, depreciation, etc.):

1. Conservative (20% conversion):
   * Annual net income = $900-945M × 0.2 = $180-189M
   * P/E = $9,968M ÷ $180-189M = 53-55
2. Historical basis (30%, based on FY25 Net/EBITDA ratio of 31.2%):
   * Annual net income = $900-945M × 0.3 = $270-283M
   * P/E = $9,968M ÷ $270-283M = 35-40
3. Base case (40% conversion):
   * Annual net income = $900-945M × 0.4 = $360-378M
   * P/E = $9,968M ÷ $360-378M = 26-28
4. Aggressive (60% conversion):
   * Annual net income = $900-945M × 0.6 = $540-567M
   * P/E = $9,968M ÷ $540-567M = 18-19

**Scenario 2: BTC around $150,000 (30% increase)**

Total gross profit increases to \~$1,160M

1. Conservative (20%): Net income = $1,160M × 0.2 = $232M, P/E = 43
2. Historical (30%): Net income = $1,160M × 0.3 = $348M, P/E = 29
3. Base case (40%): Net income = $1,160M × 0.4 = $464M, P/E = 22
4. Aggressive (60%): Net income = $1,160M × 0.6 = $696M, P/E = 14

**My Take:**

Given the current macro environment with declining interest rates, I conservatively assume Scenario 1, case 3 as the worst case. This gives us a P/E of 26-28 at today's price. For a tech company with solid assets and strong positioning in growing sectors, this seems like reasonable value.

1nkmaru,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 18:23:15,Merger Arb Opportunity - DALN,"DALN has a deal on the table to be bought for $16.50, it closed at $15.37 today. On paper thats a return of a little over 7% on a deal that should close fairly quickly, maybe 6 months-ish?. Of course like most things, its not that simple. There is a slim possibility of a higher bid, and a small possibility the deal is rejected by shareholders mad that they couldn't get a higher bid.

The one reason not to recommend it is the balance sheet is weak, and its lost money most recent years, so if the deal does fall through the downside is very real. But I discount that risk because of the other bidder.

Following is some excerpts from the always excellent Matt Levine's column that gives the lay of the land on this deal.

So they went out and talked to a few potential buyers, including Hearst Newspapers and “a high net worth individual, Party A, whom Mr. Decherd believed had journalistic values similar to those of the Company.” Eventually they reached a deal with Hearst, and in July they [announced the merger](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/cQSD-rUFsF4HKoB4VsY-kfDv-pMDsnOqnSQFeBwIXqDZSSfuCuxk8VXriprlr4IYFBpuUuHR1iOfwnn53VDqwiruqg2bTjNr2CIsbXfjt_reKgueMVDxh0nAxupak8nj4FibCRAWgcm9X0fM3A8U3Mya01uk7KnAwfEqXc9nyGdEPSCqsRYpyC1hZW9tZFmsM2M4XXzOKb0xPLr-PiytyK-SFydoNL32ocfHngyNNEWxIWykDnJOGZwKRrMJut142pWKLuMoVUT8rq7K90LIdwENmNWl0RtR5mwIKpXXFbW08sGKo74Dohjg9xBqJVTg5owTPb7PPleOk9xIBDkfJNNkqy2FhZLNqwk0lbKf02FyIg57jMqlVlDMi_8/13yyOL3KmAcuw_XceqAQuPYsqc_vAa1Y/12).

But the basic situation hasn’t changed. The Alden deal would clearly be better for shareholder value — $20 is more than $16.50 — but Decherd thinks it would be worse for journalism, and he gets to say no. “Having retired from the Board in September 2023 and having had no formal role related to the Company since then, I have no fiduciary responsibility,” [he told the board](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/f46EHZDyrSMPIT_uO260nZr-k_w0MsCReINf5ePd3DX7ZIvSCHXfEe9GM26C8ZN-EVbK6kFjcIifxW7SKs957ZBkFSiR1AraDzCmYivZF4moT8kMnNDMLXw4Uy03YFpXsTd4W7EUUBGcXfjsPdv6aVEP-kk4_UQih6XVxNxvLshYcfNsOlhqy-X4aDqWDyCDq37mntS5HZffcIGOS1mpLe3fpjtiTj7z71nZxfq4AXp0mOpgUZcP4bGhj2oELkyppIGdfe_s6UtB5tb1AwgvpJ8tnasWjjC0QaG8II_clYJ9cr8QzelkAZQrxBk_YgHeR5KLLFb_VMZiR8cQjJ2SXVLiIhDvNi7eVnhJyuoYrsWr0UEn7fiTKp30a8Y/347KtJCaauCp6KmXWEpN3bRkwCb6JI10/12): He doesn’t have to maximize shareholder value.[\[4\]](x-webdoc://4A216BF9-A9A1-4D4F-8C93-27674C55069B#footnote-4) He’s a yes on Hearst and a no on Alden, so there’s no Alden deal.

That doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a Hearst deal. The awkward fact is that, to get any merger done, the company needs the approval of two-thirds of the regular, low-voting shares; Decherd only owns 1.6% of those. Presumably most of the public shareholders care more about the extra $3.50 than they do about Decherd’s journalistic preferences. They don’t get to vote on the $20 Alden deal; they only get to vote on the $16.50 Hearst one. They *could* vote against it, but DallasNews [has said that](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/6CEdb6B4Ppu-EYv7BrC2nECV7L2MR97Vflhc7DPhzGtTPmOA7_fvVMeNYavmMHwE2aUKFDQ4zjrwWa8D_3J5n-MjJFcpy3Yz783W4y3m6MoOaDJI45Ny0WRuPkH5efYppsOC4OnlTt7oAZqVMg92X62zgSADAzSRdifFeH6FLOqmLSX8E3SZOTQ61345AOuTyxEfOtmSGVRc5v-N-LJ13UN8aGolKmej5D4n5vS1P91-RF5aaDiVIAdhFPd-CzxmiNt0xkaFpaDiHLo2q9Lb_3vjeNxYxcBLy6PRLobBgsWTHVle6ZYze1L__U6HNGmSYF2BSjuIS9agTcWQ-7arrbrLHx5Ce1DvNaKZ3PP2RZb1B4HgCn6MkHWtiUY/Zu9lBg5T8x2TE_d24KFYB2E5YqXmaNe0/12), if the Hearst deal is voted down, then there’s no deal: “If the Hearst Merger is not approved by shareholders, we will continue to operate DallasNews as an independent organization.”",2,4,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkmaru/merger_arb_opportunity_daln/,new,Stock Analysis,1.0

Cut the crap, it's been 5 years and the bags have been carried. You here to act smug or make money?

This is not some fairy tale of a $69,420 stock price with pretty images and rocket emojis, no, this is your good old serious DD of why $GME is the safest, most asymmetric bet on the market right now. No short squeezes, no crime, no bells or whistles required — just a very low-risk multi-bagger based on facts and numbers.

## Core Thesis

You've already heard this section 5 years ago from a cat much smarter than me...

It's the Ryan Cohen’s two-phase turnaround plan, which he already executed once with Chewy.

**Phase 1. Stabilize the Business**

The first phase is to avoid bleeding or even bankrupcty. This phase is already done.

- Cut costs
- Close stores
- Streamline operations
- Grow cash
- Reach profitability

**These goals were already achieved at the cost of revenue decline and stock dilution**, both of which are seen as big red flags by institutions.
But these were predictable temporary downtrends, a clear part of the strategy.

**Phase 2. Growth & Digitalization**

Once the company has capital to expand with and no risk of bankruptcy, phase 2 begins.
This is what the institutions are overlooking, still valuing GME based on its history rather than the future — hence the asymmetric opportunity.

- Build new, profitable revenue streams
- Focus on high margin digitalized products
- Focus on repeating loyal customers

This phase has just started with Q1 '25 being the first operating profitable quarter, and Q2 '25 being the first operating profitable quarter with revenue growth.

Further revenue growth will be largely driven by the (growing) collectibles market, and we can already see a +63% collectibles growth in Q2 '25.

GameStop also has a partnership with the most reputable grading service in the US, PSA, which provides high trust and a large inventory.
This partnership enables GameStop to handle everything for the customer, allowing them to buy the card at GameStop, grade the card at GameStop, and sell the card at GameStop for a 90% margin.

Compare this to GameStop's biggest competitor, eBay, where the customer themselves have to do everything:

1. first they buy the card from a potentially scammy seller,
2. then ship it manually for grading,
3. only to then list and sell it manually on eBay for yet another potential scammer buyer.

All while eBay takes a larger cut of ~15%. Even a regard like me would realize it's better to go for GameStop.

For the future we also have confirmed Power Packs, a mystery box for collectible cards, being released as a high margin digital product.
It was just released into beta in Q3 so we don't even see the revenue yet, but knowing people a mystery box is going to be extremely profitable (and more importantly, high in revenue).

Also, there's probably more to come in the upcoming years or even months, but we'll ignore that for this thesis.
Let's only focus on the facts.


## Stock Floor

GME trades at ~$10B market cap, which is very near its cash value of ~$8B.

This heavily limits any potential downside on the investment:

- In the event of GME stock collapsing, the company could buyback its shares for extremely cheap (theoretically buy all of its stock and have money left over).
- In the event of a total market collapse, the company could acquire other companies for cheap.

With ~$450M annual interest income from the ~$8B cash, the business is profitable.
Additionally, both Q1 '25 and Q2 '25 saw positive operating income.

All of this sets a hard floor for the stock at around ~$20, if not higher.

The only real way below this point is for Ryan Cohen to actually _waste_ the billions in cash.  
After having already turned the company around from bleeding to profitable.  
And after erasing all the debt and generating the billions in the first place.  
And after having successfully executed this once with Chewy already.  
All while being invested in the company with his own skin; takes no salary, no stock compensation, just ~$1B worth of stock bought with his own money.  
But sure, he'll burn $10+ billion into nothing.


## The market mispricing

Subtracting the $8B cash from the market cap, we're left with the profitable operating business, loyal customer base, PSA partnership, and a well known brand all being valued at mere $2 billion.
All while leaving **zero** valuation allocated for the future growth potential, which is already visible and happening.

Some of this is explained with GME's P/E of ~50, give or take, which is very much in line with other companies like BestBuy or Chewy.
But these other companies don't have $9B in cash.

So if we only look at the *operating business* itself and calculate the adjusted operating P/E with:

    (Market Cap - Cash) / TTM Operating EPS

We get an adjusted P/E of 4. Yes, **four**.
Even if we subtract the zero interest convertible notes from the cash first, the adjusted P/E still lands at mere 11.
Compare this to peers with 20+ or even 40+ operating P/E, we're looking at 2x to 10x undervaluation.

This mispricing is most likely due to the history and ""meme stock"" status of GME. The big investors and analysts value their career stability and herd growth over stigmatized asymmetric bets:

- Nobody wants to invest into a *meme stock* and be wrong, they would look like a fool and lose a ton of clients or even their job.
- Meanwhile if they lose money in the big stocks like Tesla or NVIDIA, they can blame ""the market"" as they were all wrong together.

If you've seen The Big Short then you know that this kind of herd behavior is not at all abnormal for Wall Street.
Michael Burry's boss and clients yelled at him while the outsiders laughed at him, but we all know how the herd behavior ended for them.

Wait, did I forget to mention that institutions have already increased their position by 100% in just the last year alone?
That they now own ~45% of GME?
Yeah, maybe they're not *all* idiots.


## Stock Potential

The collectibles market in the US alone is ~$62B, estimated to rise to ~$83B by 2030.
Capturing mere 5% of this market would yield ~$4B in annual revenue.
This would be on top of their existing revenue of ~$5B.

Considering how collectibles have great margins, even a 10% operating margin is still a very reasonable estimation.
With these numbers we'd be looking at an annual **profit** of ~1B. That's an EPS of ~$3.00. That's a stock price of $50 - $100.
Again, with an adjusted operating P/E of 4 to 11.

And that is with mere 5% of just the US collectibles market.
With GameStop's brand, a loyal customer base, and PSA partnership, it's very much lowballing the numbers.
Add a bigger share like 10% or even 15%, add a small share of Canada/Europe/Australia as well, add another revenue source besides collectibles, upgrade the operating P/E to 20+...

We're genuinely looking at a target price of anywhere from $100 to $1000+, depending on how well they execute.

And if you *really* wanted to dream **big**, try giving GameStop an NVIDIA-like market dominance status with a 90+% market share of the collectibles market. Yeah, I'll choose not type that number out to avoid people dismissing this thesis as unrealistic.


## Opportunity cost

Let's finish with a very simple comparison with the S&P 500 over the next 3 years.

- **Upside potential:**
  - GME: 2x almost guaranteed, 5x very realistic, 40x theoretically possible.
  - S&P 500: ~33% average over 3 years, maybe ~50% theoretical high.
- **Downside potential:**
  - GME: -20% if operating business gets valued at zero and GME burns some cash on nothing. Chance of Ryan Cohen burning through all the cash is close to zero.
  - S&P 500: AI bubble bursting could crash the market. War or Trump could crash the market. 50% to 70% drop not out of the question. Chance is very real, even if low.

No investment is guaranteed, but GME is as close as we can get right now. It is once again, deep *fucking* value.",13,62,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkjcul/like_it_or_not_the_best_value_stock_out_there/,new,Stock Analysis,0.56
1nkii8i,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 15:54:25,I just bought 100 shares in DUOL,"A month ago I wrote a post in this subreddit entitled [I just bought 1000 shares in INTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/UjOsd1RTrg), with an entry price under $20.

I was called a few choice names, none of which I take personally.

My favorites were: 
""may God have mercy on your soul"" and ""OK grandma"" LOL

Now that the FED has finally lowered rates, I've been looking for an AI hyperscaler that can actually deliver.

#Financials

The first thing to catch my eye about DUOL was the quarterly revenue and gross profit curves. Can we all agree that they are a thing of beauty? 

This company now delivers operating margins of 13.5% and an ROE of 19.15%. Again, extremely impressive for a company that's only been profitable for 6 quarters. Their minimal debt shows disciplined execution.

But I don't think we're finished. I think DUOL has the AI-ready platform to scale to a ROE of 60%+ ...we could be talking about the next magnificent company here, a true compounder.

#The Courses

The next thing was to test the app. I had used it about 2 years previously, but now the improvements are enormous. 

They've obviously really thought about the course material, redoing it where necessary. I feel like they have some top PHDs designing the syllabus.

For example, it used to start with sentences like ""the dog drinks water""...

Now it starts with ""I want a coffee"" - literally the first thing you need to say in a new country. Sentence bridges like ""also"" and ""actually"" are introduced early as well, giving flow to sentences, building confidence.

The repetition is now broken up with AI voice calls, language games and podcasts, all hosted by their viral characters.

Recently they announced they would be expanding many more courses from A2 to B2 language proficiency level - even providing language proficiency certificates for employers.

I spoke to my 12 year old foreign nephew for the first time in English the other day. I asked him where he learned English? expecting him to say it was from school - NOPE, it was Duolingo - apparently it's simply fun...

#Unlimited Scalability

DUOL is right to focus on languages right now, but the courses they could add are endless. Here's just a few ideas:

- Sign language
- Personal finance (badly needed imho)
- Home/car maintenance
- Philosophy
- Business administration 
- Geography
- History 

They have already added Chess, Mathematics and Music - Where does it end?!

#AI Hyperscaler

Even without AI, this company is a gem, but with artificial intelligence it's a true beast. They can use AI for:

- Reducing human workload in writing repetitive course material (still human reviewed).
- Creating exciting upsells such as the ""Talk with Lily"" voice call feature.
- Initial drafting of illustrations (this feeds into their viral marketing).
- Directing customer service requests to the right human (my help ticket was responded to in under 2 hours!).

The idea of ChatGPT integrations competing with them is laughable. This isn't as easy to replicate at scale as it looks. They already have the user base momentum...

Actually, the fact most of us still use ChatGPT and Midjourney instead of Gemini, should tell us something about the significance of first-mover advantages in AI.

#Valuation

Now let’s address the high valuation. 

I'm not one of those morons that is going to tell you PE ratios don't matter - earnings absolutely do, and always will matter.

Normally as a value investor I wouldn't buy a company with such a high forward PE.

However, what I look at more is the TRAJECTORY of capital efficiency and operating margins - which in this case (given the clear AI runway) more than justifies the price.

This company is somewhat newly profitable. Some distortion of valuations are to be expected. Earnings in November are likely to continue showing improvement in capital efficiency.

This company is about to start really standing out in stock screeners...",51,78,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkii8i/i_just_bought_100_shares_in_duol/,new,Stock Analysis,0.71

1nkf9x3,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 13:52:27,Fannie Mae ($FNMA): Undervalued Housing Finance Giant Trading Below Book with Conservatorship Overhang (9/18/25),"Fannie Mae ($FNMA) currently trades around $13.84 (9/18/25) with book value estimates closer to $10–20 per share.

Despite generating billions annually through its mortgage securitization and guarantee business, common equity remains heavily discounted because of the ongoing government conservatorship and uncertainty over recapitalization.

With Deutsche Bank initiating coverage at Buy ($20 PT) and FHFA reportedly rehiring staff ahead of IPO preparation, the investment case is shifting.

Here’s the breakdown:
Valuation
- Book value range: $10–20+ depending on recapitalization assumptions.
- Current trading price: $13.84, which still embeds a large conservatorship discount.
- Fannie continues to retain earnings (since PSPA changes in 2019), building capital for eventual exit.

Catalysts
- Analyst coverage: Deutsche Bank’s Buy initiation ($20 PT) and B. Riley’s Neutral initiation ($10 PT) bring Wall Street attention.
- IPO chatter: Reports that FHFA is preparing for a partial IPO of Fannie/Freddie stock.
- Conservatorship exit: Any move toward release, recap, or restructuring could re-rate shares closer to book.

Risks
- Dilution: Treasury’s senior preferred conversion or a large equity raise could significantly dilute common shareholders.
- Policy dependence: Exit timing is political/regulatory, not market-driven.
- Interest rate cycle: Higher rates reduce originations and earnings power.

Conclusion
FNMA is not a traditional value play in the Graham & Dodd sense… it’s a policy-driven special situation. But with a wide gap between book value and trading price, and catalysts finally re-emerging (coverage, IPO prep), the asymmetric risk/reward profile makes it worth consideration for patient investors.",6,11,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkf9x3/fannie_mae_fnma_undervalued_housing_finance_giant/,new,Stock Analysis,0.88
1nkepvr,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 13:31:46,Starbucks (SBUX) - Is the company in a death spiral or is this a huge turnaround opportunity?,"**TLDR:**

Starbucks is facing its most profound crisis since 2008. The numbers are grim: global sales are falling, customer traffic is plummeting, and profit margins are collapsing.

In China, what was once their biggest growth engine has become a strategic disaster. They've been completely outmanoeuvred by a local, tech-savvy competitor (Luckin Coffee) and their market share has collapsed. They're now reportedly looking to sell a stake in the China business at a steep discount.

Back in the US, the company is locked in a bitter and expensive war with its own workforce, as hundreds of stores have unionised and the company faces charges of illegal union-busting.

The market is pinning all its hopes on the new CEO, Brian Niccol, the guy credited with turning around Chipotle. He has a comprehensive ""Back to Starbucks"" plan to fix the in-store experience, improve efficiency, and innovate the menu.

The problem? The stock is still trading at an insane valuation (P/E over 36), pricing in a perfect, flawless execution of this turnaround. This seems insane given the massive headwinds. Is the faith in one man justified, or is the market ignoring a business whose fundamentals are cracking?

I wrote a full, in-depth analysis breaking down the numbers, the China debacle, the union fight, and whether Niccol's plan has a realistic chance of success against such a risky backdrop.

Overview
Gambling.com Group ($GAMB, ~$300M market cap) runs an asset-light, high-margin model in the online gambling industry. It earns through:
	•	Affiliate business – referring users to betting sites, earning from new depositing customers (NDCs) and their ongoing activity.
	•	Data business – selling real-time betting data and analytics, now ~25% of revenue and growing rapidly, with strong subscription-like predictability.

Financials
Since its 2021 IPO, revenue grew from $42M to $127M in 2024 (CAGR ~45%). Gross margins remain ~90%+, with adjusted EBITDA rising to $48M and net income to $30M in 2024. Management guides 2025 revenue of $171–175M (+35% YoY) and $62–64M EBITDA (+28%). Historically, GAMB has beaten guidance.

Recent Sell-Off
Despite strong results, shares are down ~49% since Feb 2025 due to:
	1.	Google’s June algorithm update briefly hurting search rankings (since resolved).
	2.	Reported IFRS EPS loss tied to contingent earnout accounting for the Odds Holdings acquisition. This is non-cash and reflects the acquisition outperforming expectations.

Bullish Case
	•	Growing, sticky data revenue (quadrupled YoY, expected to reach 50/50 mix with affiliate).
	•	Expansion tailwinds from new U.S. state gambling legalization.
	•	Strong insider ownership (~40%) and doubled buyback program ($20M).
	•	Management confidence in continued growth through 2025 and beyond.",14,22,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkcvoq/gamb_what_am_i_missing_undervalued_gaming/,new,Stock Analysis,0.94

1nkcawm,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 12:02:17,Got into short term thinking and options.. need to reset.. get back to basics,"So I've been actively investing for 5 years now.. I really got my start during covid as I saw everything was down big and it was an opportunity.. for the first few years I was investing for the long term in most of the stocks I bought. I thought I would hold for at least a year+ .. perhaps forever if I had a lot of conviction.

Then around a year ago, I sold off some stocks for various reasons and had a big pile of cash - at that point, I decided to do a few short term swing trades.. on a few stocks/etfs I saw were see sawing back and forth in price somewhat reliably.. so I bought at the low point of the pattern and sold at the high point.. I did that a couple times and made a ton of money in a matter of weeks.. 

But I was being irresponsible with my position sizing.. I was putting 50%+ of my net worth into a single stock, thinking short term and would sell when I was up 5% - rinse and repeat.....   

However, you may see where this is going.. I saw a big blue chip stock was down 5% for the day.. so I dumped 60% of my entire net worth into it.. but then it continued to slump down.. and go sideways for a couple months.. and I grew antsy.. so I sold it all and took a 6 figure loss. A month or so after I sold it, it rocketed back up and far past where I had initially bought it. The thing is, I actually total belief that would eventually happen, but I got used to making money quickly - and got FOMO and bored waiting too long.

Then I dumped it all into another company that I felt had a solid brand and was trading at 5 year lows.. (for sure it will go back up soon!) .. and again.. it slumped down further over months..  quite a few months went by watching it go lower and lower - and I realized I was paying a big opportunity cost.. so I sold last week and booked a very large loss.

Also in this period of time I dipped my feet into options, mostly selling cash secured puts and covered calls.. options is something I completely avoided for the first few years of my investing journey as I didnt fully understand them and considered them risky.

Long story short - I realize this past year that I got sucked into the habit of short term thinking and essentially gambling and I paid a heavy price for it - as I made some money, but ended up losing more in the end. I also paid a massive opportunity cost - for if I'd just had a diversified portfolio, I would be up a lot this past year with a lot less stress. There were also good long term investments that I correctly recognized, but didnt take advantage of because I was chasing short term gains.

I'm considering removing options trading from my account and rebuilding a diverse portfolio.. with no position greater then 5-10% of my portfolio. Its like I need to retrain my brain to think long term.. and to stop being lured by the prospect of short term profits. 

Maybe I needed to actually learn this lesson the hard way though... maybe in the long run it will be a good thing.. that I actually tested these theories out and got burned.    

Has anyone been through a similar experience of getting lured into short term thinking and successfully recalibrated back to a long term/value investing viewpoint?

1nkbaoy,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 11:24:50,Wendy’s (WEN): An Overlooked Value Play,"TL;DR

Wendy’s trades at a steep discount to peers (EV/EBITDA ~9x vs McDonald’s/YUM ~18–19x). It pays a 5 to 6 percent dividend and has catalysts in AI and supply chain tech (Palantir partnership), a leadership transition and activist oversight. With a 95 percent franchised model that produces steady cash flows and low capital spending WEN offers asymmetric upside for value investors.

⸻

Why WEN Screens as Value

Multiple compression vs peers
WEN trades at about 8.5 to 11x EV/EBITDA while larger burger peers are near 18 to 19x and growth names like Shake Shack above 25x. Even a move back to 12 to 14x could mean significant equity upside.

Cash-light model with real yield
95 percent franchised with stable royalties and low capital needs. Dividend yield sits around 5 to 6 percent so investors get paid to wait.

Clear long-term growth plan at depressed expectations
Management’s algorithm calls for 3 to 4 percent net unit growth, 5 to 6 percent systemwide sales growth and 650 to 700 million dollars EBITDA by 2028. Hitting those targets would force a market rethink.

⸻

Tech and Operational Catalysts

Palantir partnership
Wendy’s supply chain co-op (QSCC) is rolling out Palantir Foundry to optimize purchasing, inventory and waste reduction. This directly improves margins.

AI drive-thru rollout
FreshAI voice ordering is planned to scale to 500 to 600 locations by the end of 2025. Faster throughput, better order accuracy and lower labor costs if successful.

Competitor pause creates open lane
One of the biggest burger chains paused its AI pilot which gives Wendy’s first-mover advantage if execution is solid.

⸻

Leadership and Activist Oversight

CEO transition
Kirk Tanner left in mid-2025. CFO Ken Cook is interim CEO while the board searches. A credible hire plus a refreshed plan can unlock a re-rating.

Trian Partners still at the table
Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund remains a major shareholder and has added shares. Trian has pushed for refranchising, real estate optimization and even take-private moves in the past.

⸻

Why Longevity Matters

Wendy’s was founded in 1969. In quick service, brand equity and menu consistency translate to pricing power and resilience. The Frosty, Baconator and spicy chicken franchise is sticky. That intangible is hard to replicate and underpriced when sentiment is low.

Potential Buyout or Strategic Moves

With a cash-generating, asset-light model and activist oversight a private equity takeout or refranchising and real estate deal is not far-fetched at today’s multiples. It is not a base case but does provide a backstop for downside.

⸻

Key Risks

U.S. traffic softness or promotional pressure on franchisee margins

CEO search taking too long or new leadership missteps

Execution risk on Palantir and AI initiatives

⸻

Bottom Line

At about 9x EV/EBITDA, a 5 to 6 percent dividend yield and credible tech plus leadership catalysts WEN offers a compelling heads I win tails I get paid setup for value investors. In a sector where everyone watches McDonald’s Wendy’s looks like a mispriced middleweight with upside potential.

People are starting to catch on to the fact that they are working on licensing out their 450 petabytes of video/audio to AI training models.

Some estimates on the low end are $450-900m (assuming the license everything as low end rates of what people pay for the data). Some estimates are over $4 billion (assuming high data valuations). The program for GoPro seems to be an opt-in, with 50% revenue split between GoPro and the owner of the data. 

GoPros market cap, even amid the run up is less than $400M. Assuming some sort of middle ground (fraction of the data is sold at a cost between high and low of the range) - this stock easily doubles or triples.

Joint announcement sends Intel shares soaring in premarket trading

Updated Sept. 18, 2025 at 7:57 am ET

Shares in Intel soared nearly 30% in premarket trading Thursday after Nvidia announced it would invest $5 billion in the challenged chipmaker, giving the government’s turnaround plan a potential boost.

Nvidia said it’s buying $5 billion in Intel’s common stock at $23.28 a share and would jointly develop data center and personal computing products.


The investment pairs the world’s most valuable company, which has been a darling of the AI boom, with a chip maker that has fallen behind rivals. It further shores up Intel a month after the U.S. government said it was taking a 10% stake in an extraordinary private-sector intervention.

* 60%-85% Risky
* 85% + No Go

Steady Earnings Increase
* 5% - 20% each year

Good Return on Equity (RoE)
* 10%> No Go
* 12% Decent
* 15% + Strong

High Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)

Whereas when I first started, I went on the practice account in trading 212 and made a pie which is now up by 35%l… and I didn’t check a single company other than just looking at them and going “I like what they do”

 I’ve got a couple picks I wanna look into before actually putting money into them, so what do you look for and where do you look when screening a pick before investing?

I realise there’s more to it than just data and numbers, I’ve seen a lot of people say that they go way more off general “vibes”, looking at the market and the growth potential of the company rather than numbers, so I’m just interested to see what people look at before putting money into

Also, is my list just complete crap anyway?

1nk44m2,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 06:00:04,PYPL just announced AI partnership with Google - thoughts?,"**TLDR:** Google-PayPal multi-year deal makes PYPL a key processor for Google Cloud/Play. Stock up 3% after hours. Could advertising data sharing be the real opportunity here?

Google and PayPal dropped news about a multi-year deal where PayPal becomes a key payment processor for Google Cloud, Google Play, etc. Stock only gained 3% after hours which seems modest for what sounds like a significant partnership.

PayPal gets integrated across Google's ecosystem and Google's AI gets incorporated into PayPal's security services. This seems more substantial than their usual announcements since it involves Google Cloud enterprise payments, not just consumer-facing features.

What's interesting for me is that PayPal has been pushing into advertising lately, and Google obviously dominates that space. Could this partnership open doors for shared advertising data? Both companies could benefit from combining Google's search/ad targeting with PayPal's transaction data. That would be a pretty powerful combination for advertisers.

Been considering picking up some PayPal shares. Does this partnership signal the bottom of the stock and maybe the catalyst PYPL needs to break out of its current trading range, or is that 3% aftermarket bump all we're likely to see?

1nk42gb,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 05:56:10,Microstrategy is one of the worst investments to own,"I’ve been following MicroStrategy for a while now, and after the latest moves I felt I had to dig deeper. The more I looked, the more it reinforced my view that this company is basically the most dangerous way to own Bitcoin. A few things stood out:

The premium is collapsing. MSTR used to trade at 2–3x the value of the Bitcoin it held. That gap has shrunk dramatically, and without that premium the whole “intelligent leverage” model stops working.

Dilution has gone into overdrive. They’ve raised tens of billions this year alone through share sales and preferred stock. The share count has nearly doubled in months.
The preferreds are Ponzi-like. Proceeds from new offerings are explicitly allowed to be used to pay dividends on the old ones. That’s not sustainable.

Michael Saylor’s “never sell Bitcoin” mantra ignores risk. It’s fine as a meme, but as a corporate policy it’s insane. If Bitcoin takes a typical 70–80% drawdown, the debt and dividend obligations wipe out the equity.
Even skeptics like Jim Chanos flagged this. He called it a “perpetual motion machine of dilution,” and watching the last few months play out, it really does look that way.

Here's the post if you want the full breakdown with a 15 minute podcast (charts, filings, stress-tests, etc.): https://open.substack.com/pub/tscsw/p/avoid-microstrategy-inc-the-bitcoin?r=203zi2&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true

It honestly feels less like a Bitcoin play and more like a house of cards that only stood up as long as people were willing to pay a crazy premium. Now that premium is eroding, is this the beginning of the end for MSTR?

Curious what others here think - am I being too harsh, or is this as structurally broken as it looks?

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story.

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.

Not financial advice. Just my DD.

WARREN BUFFETT: I was busy chewing here and —

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Japan is a major holder of U.S. Treasurys. Given the troubled Japanese economy, do you foresee Japan cashing in their U.S. investments to bail themselves out? Why or why not?

WARREN BUFFETT: The problems with the Japanese economy and does that mean that — are you thinking particularly about them dumping Treasurys or something of the sort?

CHARLIE MUNGER: That’s exactly what she’s —

WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. (Laughter)

Well, you know, it’s very interesting. All the questions about what so-called foreigners do with investments.

Let’s just assume the Japanese, or any other country, decides to sell some U.S. government holdings that they have. If they sell them to U.S. corporations or citizens or anything, what do they receive in exchange? They receive U.S. dollars. What do they do with the U.S. dollars? You know, I mean they can’t get out of the system.

If they sell them to the French, you know, the French give them something in return. Now the French own the government securities.

But really as long as we, the United States, run a deficit — a big deficit — a trade deficit — we are accepting goods and giving something in exchange to foreigners. I mean when they send us whatever it may be — and on balance they send us more of that then we send over there — we give them something in exchange.

We give them — we may give them an IOU. We may give them a government bond. But we may give them an investment they make in the United States.

But they have to be net investors in this country as long as we’re net consumers of their goods. It’s a tautology.

So I don’t even know quite how a foreign government dumps its government bonds without getting some other type of asset in exchange that may have an effect on a different market.

The one question you always want to ask in economics is — and not a bad idea elsewhere, too — but is, “And then what?” Because there’s always a second side to a transaction.

And just ask yourself, if you are a Japanese bank and you sell a billion dollars’ worth of government bonds — U.S. government bonds — what do you receive in exchange, and what do you do with it? And if you follow that through, I don’t think you’ll be worried about foreign governments selling U.S. bonds. It is not a threat.

Charlie?

CHARLIE MUNGER: If I owned Japan, I would want a large holding of U.S. Treasurys. You’re on an island nation without much in the way of natural resources. I think their policy is quite intelligent for Japan, and I’d be very surprised if they dumped all their Treasurys.

WARREN BUFFETT: If they’re a net exporter to us, though, what choice do they have? When you think about it.

If they send over more goods to us than we send to them — which has been the case — they have to get something in exchange. Now for a while they were taking movie studios in exchange, you know — (Laughter)

They were taking New York real estate in exchange.

I mean they’ve got a choice of assets, but they don’t have a choice as to whether — if they send us more than they get from us — whether they get some investment asset in return.

I mean it’s amazing to me how little discussion there is about the fact that there’s two sides to an equation. But it makes for better headlines, I guess, when read the other way.

1k6qy5m,2025-04-24,2025-04-24 08:28:18,Sex Workers Already Predicted There's A Recession Coming — Here's How They Know,"

While some people anxiously watch the stock market for signs of a recession, others look for more subtle cues that the economy is in trouble.

One of them is Catherine De Noire, a manager of a legal brothel, a Ph.D. candidate in organizational psychology and an influencer. When business at her brothel unexpectedly dips, De Noire takes it as a sign that the economy is in trouble.

Although De Noire is based in Europe, she believes that economic upheaval in the United States “triggers huge uncertainty” across the pond because of America’s global influence. De Noire first noticed a decline in business right after Donald Trump was elected in November 2024, as Americans and the rest of the world anticipated upheaval.

Strippers in the U.S. are also feeling the pinch. Dancer and influencer Vulgar Vanity said that when she first started dancing in 2022, she could earn six figures just by dancing during a handful of big events in Austin, such as the Formula 1 Grand Prix and South by Southwest music festival. This year is different.

“I didn’t even bother working South by Southwest because the first Friday night I attempted to work, I walked into a completely empty club and didn’t make any money at all,” she said.

Vanity also says that many of her regular customers aren’t tipping at all or tipping less than half of what they used to. She is quick to point out that she is just one dancer and “obviously not an economist,” but she notes that other dancers and tipped workers are also hurting. Her theory is that her customers are no longer tipping as generously because of rising costs and economic uncertainty. Vanity is worried that this means we are on the verge of a recession or full-blown depression.

The theory behind the ""lipstick index"" is that when money is tight, consumers substitute costly purchases with cheap luxuries like lipstick.


Are these astute women onto something? Indicators like a decline in business at brothels, lower tips for strippers and other nontraditional measures of economic health “have a measure of validity but may be more coincident indicators than leading ones,” said Marta Norton, a chief investment strategist at Empower. While Norton finds this type of anecdotal evidence interesting, she says she looks at more traditional sources of data, especially corporate earnings and the stock market, to predict if a recession is in our future. 

By those traditional measures, “We may be slowing, but we aren’t facing a looming recession. Yet,” she said. De Noire believes that the tariffs Trump announced on what he called “Liberation Day” will “definitely contribute to a further decline and recession.”

Nevertheless, the past has shown that nontraditional measures can tell us a lot about the economy’s health. Here are some of the anecdotal indicators of the economy about whether a recession is likely.

The Brothel Index

According to De Noire, business at her brothel usually picks up in the spring once people give up on their New Year’s resolutions and recover from holiday spending. But this year, business is down. She attributes the “huge dip” in earnings at her brothel to customers feeling insecure about the economy.

“There are significantly fewer clients coming in, and the sex workers are reporting noticeably lower earnings,” she said. Although De Noire emphasizes that the top sex workers at her brothel are still earning more compared to the general population, she said some of the highest earners at her brothel are earning about half of what they did during the same time last year.

“We’re seeing clients come in less often, try to negotiate lower prices or stop visiting altogether. We’re also hearing from our workers that more clients are going for the cheapest possible service,” she said.

According to De Noire, this suggests that people are saving money or reallocating their spending toward things they see as more essential, likely because they’re preparing for challenging times ahead.

Legal brothels in the U.S. are seeing a similar trend, according to Andrew Lokenauth, a data analyst and founder of BeFluentInFinance.com. He explains that revenue at legal brothels in Nevada is down roughly 20% since last quarter. “My research shows this correlates strongly with discretionary spending trends,” indicating a recession is likely.

The Stripper Index

Strippers are often the first ones to notice a downturn in the economy. Dancers are “obviously not a priority or household necessity” and “are the first to feel it because we’re the first ones tossed aside,” Vanity said.

“The ‘stripper index’ is one of those odd but oddly effective indicators” of economic health, said David Kindness, a certified public accountant and finance expert. It tracks how much strippers are earning and how often customers are going to strip clubs, he explained.

“When tips slow down and foot traffic thins out, it often means people are holding onto their extra cash,” Kindness explained. According to Lokenauth, Vanity isn’t the only dancer feeling the squeeze, and that’s not a good sign. “Strip club revenue in Vegas is down about 12%,” which could indicate we are headed for a recession, Lokenauth said.

The Beer Index

What type of beer people drink is a “pretty good indicator” of whether a recession is on the horizon, said Jack Buffington, an assistant professor of supply chain management at the Daniels College of Business at the University of Denver.

“Beer is a discretionary spend and a social spend,” so people cut back on how much they spend on beer when they are worried about the economy, he explained. Since it’s much less expensive to pick up a six-pack than to go out for draft beers, how much money people are spending on draft beer, and pricey craft beers in particular, is a harbinger of a recession.

“Craft beer sales are way down,” potentially indicating a recession is likely, Buffington said.

The Men’s Underwear Index

In 2008, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan observed that declining sales of men’s underwear likely meant we were headed for a recession. “There’s a concerning trend. Sales dropped roughly 6% over these past months,” Lokenauth says. “Guys only skip replacing underwear when they’re worried about money,” so we may be in trouble, he says.

The Lipstick Index

The “lipstick index” “illustrates a seemingly contradictory consumer pattern during economic recessions,” explains Kevin Shahnazari, a data analyst and co-founder of FinlyWealth.

The Lipstick Index doesn’t just apply to lipstick. The theory behind the Lipstick Index is that when money is tight, consumers substitute costly purchases with cheap luxuries like lipstick.

“In the 2008 recession, cosmetics sales increased, showing that even in tough times, individuals crave tiny comfort purchases that give psychological boosts without a hefty financial outlay,” Shahnazari explained.

For example, someone might skip a costly facial but buy a $10 lipstick. Or they might skip an expensive dinner out but still buy a $6 latte or a box of expensive chocolates.

Today, cosmetics sales are strong. “MAC and Sephora sales are up about 15%, not a great sign for the broader economy,” Lokenauth said. Moreover, there “is a quiet trend towards lower-cost, no-frills beauty,” and cosmetic sales in drugstores have risen over the past few months, Shahnazari said. This could be a sign we are headed for a recession.

The Online Dating Index

How people date can also indicate whether or not we are headed for a recession. Paid subscriptions for online dating services have fallen, even though the total number of users has risen, Shahnazari said. “Free and lower-tier use of dating apps has risen by about 12%, indicating social and financial stress,” he explained.

Additionally, increased use of online dating apps can be a sign that people are looking for “cheaper entertainment and companionship instead of expensive nights out,” Lokenauth said. “I’ve tracked this metric for years, and it’s scarily accurate,” he added.

The Hemline Index

Hemlines “rise with optimism, fall with doubt,” Shahnazari said. “Although absurd, this psychological anomaly quantifies consumer confidence and social mood,” he explained. Historically, shorter hemlines meant economic optimism, and longer hemlines signaled economic trouble. For example, the happy-go-lucky flappers in the Roaring Twenties wore short dresses, but hemlines got longer during the Great Depression in the 1930s.

Currently, the Hemline Index is sending mixed signals because recent designer collections are featuring both long and short hems, Lokenauth said. Thanks to fast fashion, hemlines aren’t as clear an indicator as they once were, he explains. However, given the accuracy of the Hemline Index in the past, he thinks it’s worth keeping an eye on the runways next season.

**The Brunette Index**

If you notice fewer blond hairdos, it could be a sign a recession is looming. “Stylists are often the first to notice economic shifts, and lately, many have mentioned clients asking for easier and cheaper options,” Kindness said.

Clients may shift from high-maintenance hairstyles to lower-maintenance natural looks as a way to save money, Kindness explained. There are signs spending at salons is down. If you see formerly blond “recession brunettes” out and about, it might be a sign a recession is coming, he said.",3030,209,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-recession-is-coming-sex-workers_n_67eaa67fe4b008c5a2ecc0bc,year,Basics / Getting Started,0.96
1jaeywd,2025-03-13,2025-03-13 11:43:04,Remembering the stock market crash of 2022,"It’s easy to forget how short the market’s memory is. I think this community understands it better than anyone else, but it's still worth re-visiting from time to time.

I still remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.

Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.

Meta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren’t making money. Zuckerberg was ""burning billions"" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.

It wasn’t just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google’s ad revenue shrank. Microsoft’s growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.

And then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.

Meta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.

When markets are crashing, it feels like they’ll never go up again. When they’re at all-time highs, it feels like they’ll never go down. Neither is true. So just be calm and hold tight. And if you can, keep buying.

1ki81ib,2025-05-08,2025-05-08 22:36:48,Buffett’s Farm Analogy Is Still the Clearest Way to Think About Valuation,"Buffett once explained business valuation using something as simple as a farm — and honestly, it cuts through all the noise.

Imagine you’re looking at a farm 30 miles out. You figure out how many bushels of corn and soybeans it produces per acre, what fertilizer and labor cost, and what you’re left with .. say, $70 per acre in profit.

Then you ask a simple question:  
*How much would I pay to earn $70 a year forever?*

If you want a 7% return, you’d pay $1,000. If the farm is going for $900, it’s a buy. If it’s $1,200, you pass.

That’s it. No drama, no daily price tracking, no CNBC.

Buffett says investing is just that ,,,,figuring out how much cash a business can produce over time, and what you’re paying for it. That’s intrinsic value.

And you don’t need to have an opinion on every stock. Most go into what he calls the “too hard” pile. The goal isn’t to be right about everything  it’s to wait for the few things that are easy to understand and priced right.

You don’t need to jump seven-foot bars. Just step over the one-foot ones.

That’s value investing.

1k2dlk8,2025-04-18,2025-04-18 15:37:17,Buffett's alternative to tariffs is seriously brilliant (Import Certificates),"I'm honestly not sure how this hasn't been brought up more, but Buffett actually has a beautifully elegant alternative to tariffs that solves for the trade deficit (which is a very real problem, he said in 2006.... ""The U.S. trade deficit is a bigger threat to the domestic economy than either the federal budget deficit or consumer debt and could lead to political turmoil..."")

Here's how Import Certificates work...

* Every time a U.S. company exports goods, it receives ""Import Certificates"" equal to the dollar amount exported.
* Foreign companies wanting to import into the U.S. must purchase these certificates from U.S. exporters.
* These certificates trade freely in an open market, benefiting U.S. exporters with an extra revenue stream, and gently nudging up the price of imports.

The brilliance is that trade automatically balances itself out—exports must match imports. No government bureaucracy, no targeted trade wars, no crony capitalism, and no heavy-handed tariffs.

Buffett was upfront: Import Certificates aren't perfect. Imported goods would become slightly pricier for American consumers, at least initially. But tariffs have that same drawback, with even more negative consequences like trade wars and global instability.

The clear advantages:

* **Automatic balance:** Exports and imports stay equal, reducing America's dangerous trade deficit.
* **More competitive exports:** U.S. businesses get a direct benefit, making them stronger in global markets.
* **Job creation:** Higher exports mean more domestic production and, consequently, more American jobs.
* **Market-driven:** No new bureaucracy or complex regulation—just supply and demand at work.

I honestly don't know how this isn't being talked about more! Hell, we could rename them Trump Certificates if we need to, but I think this policy needs to get up to policymakers ASAP haha.

Edit: removed ‘no new Bureaucracy’ as an explanation for market driven. It def does increase gov overhead, thanks for pointing that out!

Buffett was asked if he's worried about “NASDAQ stocks trading at 30x revenues instead of 10x earnings.” His answer?

“We don’t care. There’s always a part of the market that’s nuts.”

They tried shorting hype stocks once when they were younger. Were right. Still lost money.

Also, they don’t chase international stocks *just* because they’re cheap. But if a $5B+ business outside the U.S. meets their standards? Game on. Geography isn’t the filter — durability is.

My favorite part though?

“We don’t have to predict the future. We buy businesses where chewing gum is still chewing gum in 20 years.”

Now  I know some folks will ask for tickers. I get it.  
But the real flex isn’t copying someone’s stock list , it’s knowing **what return** ***you*** **need** and then working backwards to figure out if the valuation gives it to you.

 “Buy the dip!”  “Be greedy when others are fearful!” Lmao 

Did you really think you’d be the one who wasn’t fearful? Especially when all the smart people around you are being fearful?

“Buy great companies at good prices.”  Lmao.  Did you think you’d find a company with perfect fundamentals that just HAPPENED to be priced poorly?  

I think people misunderstand the cliches.  
In order to get a good price on something, it REQUIRES either poor macroeconomic circumstances or poor management.  In order to get a GREAT price, it requires both at the same time.

GEICO was arguably Buffet’s best investment from 1965 to 2025.


In 1975-76, when Buffet bought it, it was near bankruptcy, hemorrhaging losses, and trading under $3/share.   From 1976 to 1986, GEICO delivered 50% CAGR.


All investors could see was wreckage. Geico was expanding coverage into risky areas at ridiculously low premiums.  Inflation hit and boom… their claim costs suuurrrrrged.


They took on huge underwriting losses.  Claims ballooned, especially from urban drivers and their young policyholders.

They were so focused on growth that they forgot about making sure they had adequate reserves.   

This js why Buffet is absolutely GOATED.  On paper, EVERYTHING about Geico looked horrible.  At least to my accounting eyes.  Hindsight makes some of the turnaround signs seem obvious, but they really weren’t quantifiable via something like a dcf. 


- claim rates are surging
- claim costs are surging
- claim fraud is surging
- inadequate cash reserves
- governments block insurance price increases right when Geico wanted to increase premiums
- too many employees and regional offices.
- management just accelerated the losses to force revenue growth

- double digit inflation…
- interest rate hikes to over 13%
- recession
- oil crisis
- stock market crashes 50%

- then all of a sudden this all adds up to a $126million loss and bankruptcy was on the table…


…. Enter Warren Buffett. Absolutel animal.  Looks at all this and decides “This is a wonderful company.”

Everyone was fearful for very good reasons.  If Reddit were around back then, every single valueinvestor user would be shit talking Geico.

Buffet just decided, meh… the business model is good, liquidity is high enough to avoid bankruptcy for a few more years, and Geico is a good brand.  What more do you need for a thesis? 


+20 bagger for Buffet.


Whenever you see **truly discounted prices**, the backdrop always looks fucking brutal.

- Earnings are collapsing.
- Management seems clueless.
- The economy feels like it’s in freefall.
- Financial news is a parade of panic.

Blah blah blah. 

But are these not the exact conditions that allow us to buy quality assets at deep discounts?

Prices always reflect a reasonably justified fear.
Good prices come from bad news. But the bad news doesn’t last forever.

$61 to $2 is what happened to Geico’s stock.  It fell for 4-5 years straight.   

…Imagine negative trends in earnings, debt growth , asset contraction, cash burn, and margin contraction all holding for that long, but you manage to look at it and see it as a winner.

1gqy05k,2024-11-14,2024-11-14 00:41:07,A few observations on Mr Market from an Old Timer,"I'm 57 and long retired.  I've been in the markets for almost thirty years, twenty of those years as a professional (hedge funds, PE and a bit of investment banking).  I've always had a value mindset and thus I've been skeptical of growth-related hype.  So a few observations... worth exactly what you're paying for them.

At the peak of the 2000 internet bubble the top-10 companies (by market cap) in the S&P were worth 10.1% of then-global GDP.  Which was an outrageous valuation at the time.  Well, today that same figure is almost 17%.  Yup, almost 70% higher.  What does it mean?  I don't know.  But it probably means something.

I've witnessed three huge bubbles during my career: the Internet Bubble, the Everything Bubble I (prior to the Financial Crisis), and now the Everything Bubble II.  I have never seen anything like the current bubble - bullishness in all sectors just off the charts.  Caution trading at the biggest discount I can ever remember.  What does it mean?  I don't know.  But it probably means something.

My two biggest concerns with current market conditions are: (1) so much of the current conditions has been monetary driven - between the Fed, fiscal stimulus, and the other Central Banks' stimulus, there's just so much cash sloshing around the global jello bowl that it all has to go somewhere (and that somewhere has clearly been financial assets), and (2) the folks setting the prices in the most speculative assets don't appear to own the instruments they're trading in - they're just tossing them around hoping the ""number go up"" paradigm will never capitulate.  The only conviction is that someone will pay more for it tomorrow.  This has always been a feature of markets, of course.  But now it appears to be the *only* feature where a lot of the most prominent assets are concerned: Nvidia, Tesla, Bitcoin, etc.  (Tesla's entire market cap, for example, turns over every 30 trading days on average.)  What does it mean?  I don't know.  But it probably means something.

I've seen some crazy market conditions.  But this takes the cake.  If worldly wisdom teaches one anything,  however, it's that things can always get crazier.  We live in interesting times.

Despite the strong economic data, low unemployment rates, Reddit determined we were definitely in a recession because someone's dad went out to dinner the other Friday night and the place was empty. When someone's dad goes out to eat and there's no one there, this is definitely a leading indicator of a recession. I am asking because I panicked and sold all my positions, and wet my pants. and I am now mostly in cash, wondering if I should now buy back in. Even though it's very common advice to not time the market, I did it anyway because everyone else on Reddit was doing it, and as I said, Reddit is an objective source of truth.

1nblsgb,2025-09-08,2025-09-08 08:00:40,"The S&P500 is still underwater YTD, adjusted for currency depreciation","I am not trying to make any predictions here, but after the ""great crash"" of 2025 a few months ago, many people jumped the gun in saying: ""you see? it's all panic, stocks only go up"". I am heavily invested in Europe since last year and I have been warning that Trump would not be good for the US stock market. People did not believe me back then and do not believe me now. YTD, the S&P500 is up 9.7%. At the same time, the USD vs EUR is down -11%. If we add in inflation, it's even worse.

Right now, this bull market is sustained only by AI hype and not much else, with the mega caps outperforming the rest of the index, while recent job reports now suggest that the economy is going worse, hitting highest youth unemployment since May 2021. Perhaps the stock market will continue to go up, because higher unemployment means lower rates, but it also means inflation will probably be higher. If Trump gets want he wants with rates, turkey-style hyperinflation is not impossible. Given that the US government debt relative to GDP continues to compound, either the dollar goes down in value, or taxes need to go up, at some point. 

Damaging diplomatic relationships and putting in question the independence of the FED and meddling with the private sector (I am pointing at Trump saying that Intel's CEO should be fired, his decision to stop near-completed wind turbine projects being built in the US by Danish companies, his relationship with musk, saying he wants to lower the value of the dollar to make exports competitive....) is the worst thing he can do, since US bonds and stocks is one of the biggest exports that the US has. This is justified by the ""US exceptionalism"". But if this exceptionalism is put into question, that will have huge consequences. 

Regardless, what the FED does or does not do should not influence us as value investors, but my point remains: US exceptionalism is more than priced in already, and at current multiples, it is justified by AI, recency bias, and a tendency of investors to chase returns.

After doing some reading and listening to many Youtube videos about value investing. And especially after knowing the one of the richest men in the planet got so rich by value investing. I decided that I need to test it.

The first problem is that I have never done it before and I just can't dump cash into a strategy I have never tested. And the second problem was that it's not easy for me to find and read multiple DDs about hundreds of companies in order to find which ones fall into the value investing category.

So I made a web application that does just that. It goes through the SP500 companies and finds which ones are undervalued, mostly stable and profitable. I want to share with you the stocks that it picked for me. In which I invested in a paper account. And the return on the demo investment since the first of July 2025. (2 Months)

|Ticker|Return (2 Months)|
|:-|:-|
|UAL|27.96%|
|APA|25.86%|
|DHI|24.29%|
|BLDR|19.56%|

1lo4kq2,2025-06-30,2025-06-30 07:00:12,Top 10 things to do while the market is at all time high.,"
1. **Ignore the market.**

Value investors are bottom-up stock pickers. We buy undervalued stocks of companies. Not undervalued markets.

2. **Sharpen the saw** 

Read a book, learn about business models, competitive advantage, and how to value a company.

Eg. Learn how to DCF. This is a great time to learn how to do excel by creating your very own DCF. Remember, the value of a company is the sum of the future cash flows it produces discounted to the present. 

3. **Start an investment diary.**

Write down what you bought, sold, and also the why, and what will make you sell. 

4. **Learn other ways to value a company besides DCF.**

Like Relative Valuation. Like IRR method. Like Dividend Discount Model. 

5. **Sign-up with your local library.**

 And download the Libby app to read or to stream the digital audio book, Buffett’s Early Investment by Brett Gardner.

6. **Great time to tinker with screeners.**

Try something different this time, screen for quality instead of value. Or screen for value for international stocks.

7. **Watch your favourite Wall Street movies and laugh at the inconsistencies.**

Wall Street.    
Quick Silver.   
Trading Places.   
Bonfire of the Vanities.  
The big short.   
Barbarians at the Gate     
Wolf of Wall Street.  

8. **Pick up a cheap HP 12c calculator** and learn how to do NPV and do financial maths in reverse polish notion. 

9. **Go and investigate why are there at least three versions of EPS** by financial websites and which is the one that you trust. Here are three you check that are almost definitely different: market screener, yahoo finance and Market Watch. 

10. **Check the Barron’s or WSJ websites for stocks selling at 52-week lows.**

Eg from last Friday’s trading: 

Molson Coors,     
Campbell,     
Kraft Heinz,   
Conagra Brands,   
are all trading at one year lows.

There are situations you will see over a long period of time… I mean you will see things that it would be a mistake if you’re working with smaller sums, it would be a mistake not to have half your net worth in.

I mean you really do sometimes in securities see things that are lead pipe cinches and you’re not going to see them often, and they’re not going to be talking about them on television or anything of the sort, but there will be some extraordinary things happen in a lifetime where you can put 75% of your net worth or something like that in a given situation.

1id54hz,2025-01-29,2025-01-29 16:27:23,"Are you an expert in your field of work? If so, which stocks in that sector are you bullish on?","Hey! Occasional forum lurker, but first post here.

Warren Buffet said he only invests in companies he understands. But the world is becoming more global, interconnected and specialized - I think most people would agree it's easier to understand what Coca-Cola or Starbucks do than what eg. Broadcom does. We also don't have access to our own research teams like professional investors do. What we do have, however, is communities like this where the sum of our combined knowledge is enormous. So I thought of a concept (sorry if it's been posted before) - if you are an expert in your field, share with us any stock(s) you are bullish on and think will beat the S&P500 over the next 5+ years. Preferably outline why you think so, ie. elaborating on its bull case/moat and potential risks, while considering the current valuation.

I'll start. I work as an endocrinologist in Europe. That is, a medical doctor specialized in hormonal and metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity. I'm bullish on Novo Nordisk. Here's why.

The new class of GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs are the closest thing we currently have to miracle drugs, without wanting to sound sensational (consult your own doctor before starting it lol). There are currently only two players in the town: Novo Nordisk with its Semaglutide, and Eli Lilly with its Tirzepatide. Let's look at what these drugs do: Semaglutide reduces HbA1c (long term blood sugar) by around 1,7 % in type 2 diabetes which is amazing, vs. Tirzepatide's 2,1 %. Weight loss is around 15 vs 21 % after around 1,5 years - although recently NVO did a study on 3x the current approved upper dose of Semaglutide showing 20 % weight loss. Both drugs have studies proving effect on heart failure, chronic kidney disease (Tirzepatide only through other studies, not a study designed to look at this specifically although it is under way) and metabolic fatty liver disease, although I don't know the exact effect sizes here. Only Tirzepatide has study data on obstructive sleep apnea (also NVO's old Liraglutide), but this should be a class effect secondary to the weight loss. Only Semaglutide has a large study demonstrating a reduction of cardiovascular events like stroke and heart attack (the SELECT study), which was large, independent of the weight loss effect and rather sensational when it came out. LLY's study on this, SURPASS, is currently underway and I'd guess this is also a class effect. Semaglutide has shown promise on alcohol and drug use disorders and studies are underway. Preliminary data implies that the GLP1 class can also reduce the risk of dementia, at least in diabetics (which tbh is expected when you lower the blood sugar and might not be a specific effect of GLP1s). As you can tell by the aforementioned, the market is f\*cking huge for these things, and far from being saturated. Diabetes type 2 has a prevalence of 5-10 % in most populations, and obesity >25 % in many countries. On these 2 indications alone, which they currently have official indications for in Europe (only recently Sema and Tirze got FDA approval for chronic kidney disease and sleep apnea respectively), they have struggled to meet demand. Tirzepatide only came to Europe some months ago as LLY have struggled to supply its domestic market, while there have been shortages of Semaglutide for over a year in Europe. This is also while many countries, at least in Europe (idk how Medicare works lol) have not covered Semaglutide for obesity, due to the huge costs it would be for the governments (remember most countries outside US have universal health care afaik). A month's worth of Semaglutide in my country is about $250, which many people won't pay for themselves, thus limiting demand. These drugs also stop working when you stop taking them, causing the weight to be regained over time, which obviously is a huge plus to the pharma companies.

Okay, so an enormous market that's far from being saturated. There's clearly room for both these two players, and it doesn't matter that Tirzepatide appears to be slightly better if it's unavailable either due to demand exceeding supply or due to higher pricing. So what about up and coming drugs? LLY's Retatrutide shows weight loss in the region of 25 % which is amazing, whereas CagriSema (Semaglutide + an amylin agonist called Cagrilintide) showed a ""disappointing"" 22 % weight loss after a company had predicted over 25 %. This caused the stock to plump over 20 % before New years, which I think is such an overreaction based on the aforementioned stuff. Also, the study did only have 57 % of the participants on the max dose at the end. This might be a concern if indicates more side effects, but another possibility is because the study was designed to be like real life where if a patient gets adverse effects the clinicians are lenient to let them lower the dose - many people can in real life not tolerate the highest doses. If so, very ethical and nice of the company, but bad for shareholders since it might have costed them the 25 %. Anyway, the stock rebounded by around 10 % last week when their latest drug, Amycretin, showed around 20 % weight loss after only around 30 weeks, which is probably even better than Retatrutide. All in all, I'd hold Lilly slightly ahead of Novo right now as a company alone, but not by much. Let's look at the valuations then. Revenue is about the same, but LLY has a market cap thats about twice as large. In other words, almost twice the P/S (10 vs 18). NVO has significantly better margins, which means that P/E is even more discrepant (28 and 22 forward vs 86 and 35 respectively). NVO has much more cash and free cash flow, while only sligthly more debt. Looking at the valuations and putting it together with the products, I think NVO is a way better pick than LLY. Non-GLP1-portifolios are, I think, rather similar between the companies. NVO has the better long acting insulin in degludec, their rapid acting insulins are about the same in Fiasp and Lyumjev, Lilly has more non-diabetes stuff that I'm not familiar with, while NVO has in very preliminary animal studies made a ""smart insulin"" that only works when the blood sugar is high and is ""switched off"" when it becomes normal/low. Absolutely huge if it can work in humans, but extremely early, so not attributing this too much value atm.

So what about the bear case? In the absence of the scenario where data in 5-10 years show increased cancer risk from GLP-1 agonists (cancer takes like 20-30 years to develop so getting this data would take time), which I think is unlikely based on animal studies, it's mainly about the competition. Many other pharma companies want a piece of the cake and are close to releasing their own GLP-1s, like Boehringer Ingelheim, Amgen, Pfizer and some Chinese company. These show about 20 % weight loss, so probably good stuff, but at the time they will be released both LLY and NVO will probably have superior products in Retratrutide and Cagrisema. But even more importantly, they will probably have a way larger production capacity due to their head start. On this matter, NVO is expanding its US production so I'm not worried about potential tariffs.

For these reasons I think NVO will continue to have immense revenue and profits from these products for at least 5 years, and probably much longer since they're also ahead in the R&D department. Based on history, I also have faith in NVO continuing to innovate beyond Amycretin. They invest huge amounts in research.

I was lucky to buy the dip before the Amycretin data made it pop 10 % last week, but I'd still say this company is rock solid and a good buy at this valuation. It probably won't be a 5- or 10-bagger, but I'm confident it'll beat the S&P500 over the next 5 years. Do your own DD and remember to diversify, I'm not a financial advisor and anything can happen in the market.

Tech stocks are trading at absolutely ridiculous multiples, and everyone seems to have forgotten basic valuation principles. PE ratios are looking more like fantasy football scores than rational financial metrics.

Take the Nasdaq 100 - it's up around 30% this year, but are corporate fundamentals actually justifying these valuations? I'm seeing companies with negative earnings trading at 20x revenue, and investors are treating these like they're guaranteed winners.

The AI hype is driving a lot of this, but beneath the surface, I'm seeing:

* Unsustainable growth projections
* Minimal attention to actual cash flows
* Investors treating speculative narratives as hard metrics

Value investors are getting squeezed. The traditional metrics we rely on - price-to-book, consistent earnings, strong balance sheets - seem almost quaint right now.

But the mechanics of how this company operates have some concerning similarities, and I can't shake the feeling that it's a massive house of cards.

I was so curious that I decided to research it and make a post about it, here are the main points from that post that I found out:

* **Their actual business is basically irrelevant.** MicroStrategy is a software company, but its revenue from that has been flat or declining for years. The entire bull case is 100% about Bitcoin, which means the company itself doesn't actually *create* any value. It's just a container for a single asset.
* **It's a ""Perpetual Dilution Machine.""** They use debt and continuously sell new MSTR shares to buy more Bitcoin. Because the stock trades at a massive premium to the Bitcoin it holds, they're essentially using new investors' money (who are paying a premium) to increase the Bitcoin-per-share for existing holders. It's a cycle that only works as long as new buyers keep piling in at inflated prices.
* **You're paying an insane premium for BTC.** When you buy $MSTR, you're not just buying Bitcoin. You're paying a huge markup. People have calculated it to be a 2x premium or even more at times. Why would anyone do that when you can just buy a Bitcoin ETF (even a leveraged one) for a fraction of the cost and get more direct exposure? It makes no sense.
* **The whole thing relies on Michael Saylor's salesmanship.** Michael is a charismatic speaker, but he has a history (look up their stock in the dot-com bust of 2000) of leading investors off a cliff with big promises. It feels like the entire valuation is propped up by his cult of personality and the belief that ""number go up,"" rather than any sound financial reasoning.

This is just a summary to save time, but if you are interested in the full analysis I'll link the post and 40 minute podcast here: [https://tscsw.substack.com/p/dont-buy-microstrategy-inc-mathematically](https://tscsw.substack.com/p/dont-buy-microstrategy-inc-mathematically)

It just feels like this entire operation is designed to enrich early shareholders at the expense of everyone who buys in later. The structure is unsustainable and seems designed to collapse spectacularly once the hype dies down or Bitcoin has a serious correction.

The legendary investor, 94, opens up about his decision to hand the top job to Greg Abel; ‘How do you know the day that you become old?’

By 
Karen Langley

May 14, 2025 at 3:24 pm ET

Warren Buffett can’t put his finger on exactly when he decided to hand over the reins of Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B -1.66%decrease; red down pointing triangle to Greg Abel.  

But in recent years Buffett observed just how much energy his appointed successor brought to each working day. And how his own days had slowed. The two men were operating at different speeds—increasingly so.  

“There was no magic moment,” Buffett, now 94, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. “How do you know the day that you become old?”

Berkshire shareholders and onlookers have long wondered how anyone could replace Buffett, for decades a towering figure in American business and finance. But as he passed his 90th birthday, Buffett began to experience something most people come to accept much earlier in life: his age. 

“I didn’t really start getting old, for some strange reason, until I was about 90,” he said by phone from his office in Omaha, Neb. “But when you start getting old, it does become—it’s irreversible.”

The financial industry thrives on overcomplicating things to justify fees.

As Charlie Munger said:*""The whole damn system is corrupt... everyone wants easy money, fast. And that requires a big fee.""*

Think about it: there’s **$2 trillion** locked in mutual funds charging **2% fees** while underperforming cheap index funds like the S&P 500. Who’s really winning here? Hint: it’s not us.



# 2. Temperament beats intelligence

Investing isn’t about being the smartest—it’s about controlling your emotions.

* Warren Buffett: *""The most important quality is temperament, not intellect.""*
* I read a study of a fund that averaged an **18% annual return**, but the **average investor in that fund lost money** because they tried to time the market.

**Lesson:** Fear and greed will destroy your portfolio faster than any bad stock pick.



# 3. The S&P 500 is your cheat code

Here’s your free investing hack: **buy the S&P 500 and chill.**

* Low fees.
* Decades of growth.
* Outperforms **98% of funds** consistently.

Even Charlie Munger admits:*""Wealth managers have almost zero chance of beating an unmanaged index like the S&P.""*

So why do people chase stock-picking glory? Because too many investors confuse excitement with success.



# 4. Picking stocks is really hard

Think it’s easy to find the next Tesla? It’s not. And even if you do, good luck getting in before the hype.

* Buffett: *""If you can’t value the stock, you can’t invest in it. You can gamble on it, but you can’t invest.""*
* Most people buying stocks have never even read a balance sheet.

**Picking winners is possible, but it’s incredibly hard—think Charlie Munger-level hard.**



# What this all means

The truth is, the game is rigged for most people to lose. But that doesn’t mean you can’t win.The winners aren’t the ones chasing hype stocks or flexing their ""10-baggers""—they’re the ones quietly compounding wealth by staying disciplined and focusing on what works: **consistency, patience, and a solid strategy.**

So, how does this match up with your experience? **What lessons have you learned the hard way?**",421,135,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1h28d43/the_truth_i_learnt_from_warren_buffett_and/,year,Investor Behavior,0.87

- Huge AI Lab with almost SOTA models and great research team.
- GCP with increasing AI usage and custom TPUs.
- YouTube + Ads : worth more than NFLX on its ownband growing in the AI content boom era.
- AI Tools in Advertising
- AI in search AI Mode and Overviews are making search sticky.
- Android : Mass AI distribution potential for today. 
- Android XR : AI device launch vehicle with Glasses and Headsets, future looking platform. Already has Samsung, XReal, Sony as partners.
- Waymo : Only operational self driving fleet with paid rides.
- Quantum Computing : SOTA quantum processor in Willow and long standing research.

Negatives : 
- Anti-trust lawsuits : quite frankly some cases seem outdated with AI nocking down the search industry doors. Android lawsuit in Europe seems more like a punishing-success story. 

- Search Revenue : no noticeable impact on revenue yet but we should start seeing some impact soon. Question is can it be offset ?

1i6jjjo,2025-01-21,2025-01-21 09:17:21,How I Find 2-10 Bagger Stocks,"I look for undervalued businesses—companies that generate strong cash flow, have durable advantages, and are selling for less than they’re worth.  
  
Here’s how I find them.  
  
1. The Screener: My First Filter  
I start with a stock screener. Finviz is my go-to, but sometimes I use [stockanalysis.com](http://stockanalysis.com) .   
I use these filters targeting mostly mid caps as these have a longer growth runway:  
  
✅ P/E Ratio Under 20 – If I’m paying more than 20x earnings, I better have a damn good reason.  
✅ Forward P/E Under 15 – I want earnings growth at a reasonable price.  
✅ PEG Ratio Under 1 – Cheap stocks with strong growth potential.  
✅ EPS Growth Past 5 Years Over 30% – I want companies that are getting stronger, not stagnating.  
✅ High Insider Ownership – If the CEO isn’t betting his own money, why should I?  
  
This weeds out the noise. What’s left? Stocks that are cheap, growing, and run by people with skin in the game.  
  
2. Dataroma: Superinvestors & My Own Research  
I track Dataroma weekly. It tells me what top investors are buying and selling. But I don’t blindly copy trades. I piggyback on their ideas, then do my own research to determine if a stock fits my strategy.  
  
When I see a company that looks promising, I dig deeper:  
  
Why is it undervalued?  
Does it fit my investing principles?  
What’s the downside risk?  
How does it compare to other opportunities?  
If it checks my boxes, I buy. If not, I move on.  
  
3. 52-Week Lows: Hunting for Mispriced Assets  
Every week, I check stocks hitting 52-week lows. Markets overreact. A great business can drop 30-40% on short-term fears, but if the fundamentals are intact, it becomes a value play or an asset play.  
  
I look for:  
✅ Stocks within my circle of competence – I don’t buy what I don’t understand.  
✅ Companies unfairly punished by market sentiment – The goal is to buy strong businesses at weak prices.  
✅ Hidden assets – Sometimes, a stock’s valuation ignores valuable real estate, brand power, or patents.  
  
This is where I find bargains the market has temporarily forgotten.  
  
Final Thoughts: Discipline Over Noise  
I don’t buy just to buy. I let screeners, Dataroma, and 52-week lows guide my research, but I always do my own work. I have other ways I find stocks that I will share in future posts!

1jfv8i1,2025-03-20,2025-03-20 14:03:55,Yet Another Financial Reporting Mystery at Tesla... (1.4 billion disappeared),"So, there is what the media says about this (pointing fingers and freaking out) and then there is what really happened.

So, looking at TSLA financial statements from 2024, we see they report $6.3 billion in fixed asset purchases (this is a very capital-intensive business of making cars, nothing in that alone is shocking). However, while $6.3 billion in cash went out the door, only 4.9 billion in fixed assets came back in. This, to me, is alarming for the misstatement but not for the impact. In reality, they should most likely have noted they are employing a highly aggressive expensing strategy (that's probably questionable but not illegal) or that they have losses due to exchange rates. They didn't note that, and that's a problem with the leadership and their knowledge of financial accounting which should bother TSLA investors (are the books reliable in other areas?), but it isn't really the headline it's been made out to be. This company has a history of producing financial reports which raise questions, but it has continued to be a going concern with a strong cash balance across that time...

\*\*\*\*

**I am going to however call TSLA out on the same thing I've posted about five times since 2022: Why are they issuing so much new debt?** This company does have a problem in the financial strategy wing in that they keep issuing billions and billions and billions in new debt even though they also report decent cash flows.

Why?  
Because income statements are easy to dress up. Balance sheets? Not so much. They show what a business really owns, owes, and hides.

Here’s what Warren actually wants to see:

* Plenty of cash
* Little or no debt Rising retained earnings
* High return on tangible assets 
* Clean inventories & receivables If inventory is piling up or customers aren't paying, something stinks.

What he avoids:

* Massive goodwill with flat earnings - overpaid acquisitions.
* Ballooning intangibles with no real cash flow.
* Companies that look profitable but are drowning in debt.
* Creative accounting masks —-especially when the auditor notes are longer than the CEO letter.

If they were to spend that same money today at todays share price, they could purchase 7.3m shares or 70% more shares.  

What's worse is they've already spent another $200 million on share buybacks this year already at an average of approximately $100.  

Imagine if they'd just taken the safe route and put all this money into debt repayment. They'd be on track to being debt-free in the next 12 months or so. At which point they could probably just pay the stupidest dividend of 10-15% annually.


My honest opinion is the following: 

1. Investors have a tendency to overrate share buybacks and get overly excited because you're effectively seeing compounding in real-time. 

2. Buy back should be done conservatively. If a share price seems reasonable, then companies should err towards a dividend and definitely debit repayment if it exists.  For me, buybacks are more of a tool to hit the gas and put the metal to the floor when it makes sense. I own GigaCloud Technology, for example, and they bought back 4% of their company in the first six months of this year as people panicked over their share price (traded at 2x cash and 5x earnings lol). *That was a good use of buybacks*

3. If you ever see a company buying back its shares regardless of what's going on, it's a red flag, and you should be concerned.  $LULU for example, was buying back their shares at record multiples even with moderating growth. just why? Why not just pay a modest dividend?  This unfortunately means that every single share they purchased in the last five years was significantly above the share price today. 5 years of cash returns that have effectively lost anywhere from 30% to 50% of their original value.  

Anyway, I expect this one to be a little controversial, but it's something I've been thinking about a lot lately because I've become increasingly skeptical of the average CEO and CFO's ability to understand and how to properly value their business.  And thus make intelligent decisions with buybacks.",357,100,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1mlseme/crocs_bought_550m_of_shares_at_12794_in_2024/,year,Discussion,0.96

1mi4hh3,2025-08-05,2025-08-05 05:25:23,Sometimes it's that easy: ASML,"If you’re a long-term investor looking for a stock with a strong moat, healthy margins, predictable revenue, and exposure to a growing industry, I don't think there's a better stock than ASML. The company plays a key role in lithography, which is an essential part of chip manufacturing.

ASML holds around 80% of the DUV market (used for less advanced chips), where it competes with Nikon and Canon. More importantly, it has a monopoly in the EUV market (used for more advanced chips), as it's the only company with the technology necessary to produce them.

Despite short-term headwinds, ASML estimates revenue between €44 and €60 billion and gross margins of 56–60% by 2030. If we take the low end of that guidance and assume no margin expansion, we’re still looking at \~10% CAGR:

(44 - 28.2) / 28.2 = 56%, and 56 / 7 = \~8% CAGR.

If we include buybacks and dividends, the total return approaches 10% CAGR. In my view, a monopoly trading at 25x TTM P/E in a long-term growth industry with 10% assured growth is a very attractive deal.

1. What if Trump’s tariffs impact the global economy and trigger the end of this chip cycle?

That’s a reasonable concern. If tariffs significantly hurt global GDP, companies like TSMC, Rapidus, Intel, and Samsung might cut capex, which would directly affect ASML. But you have to ask: what if it doesn’t happen? If nothing materializes, you’ve passed on a great business at a great price trying to predict macro events. If you want to take that risk, fine but it’s worth questioning.

2. What if ASML has a bad quarter and the stock drops further?

That could definitely happen. But trying to time that is closer to gambling than investing. Long-term, the fundamentals remain solid.

Competition from China:

I have no doubt that China will eventually develop EUV technology. Throw enough money at the problem, and you’ll solve it. But the questions are: when and how good will it be?

Here are three reasons I’m skeptical China will match ASML:

(1) Past failures in tech replication:

China has struggled to catch up in other critical tech sectors, jet engines, for example. Yes, EUV is arguably even more important, but this illustrates there’s a non-zero chance they won’t succeed, or won’t succeed soon.

(2) Timeline matters:

Even if China gets EUV, timing is crucial. A breakthrough in 20 years isn't the same risk as one in 5. ASML has been developing this tech since the late 1990s. Plus, ASML doesn’t build everything itself, it’s a system integrator (like Airbus or Boeing), relying on highly specialized suppliers like Zeiss, which has 100+ years of experience in mirror manufacturing. That’s not something you replicate overnight. And remember: there are \~5,000 suppliers involved.

(3) Experience = Efficiency:

Even if China gets EUV and starts mass production, their machines will likely underperform due to lack of experience. ASML machines have processed millions of wafers and are constantly improving. Chinese alternatives would likely have lower throughput and yield. And despite China’s large domestic market, I believe advanced-node fabrication outside China will remain bigger, further reinforcing ASML’s moat.

But even if the worst-case scenario plays out and China catches up in 5-10 years, you still end up with a duopoly. That’s certainly worse than a monopoly, but the export ban on EUV would likely be lifted by then, and ASML would have a bigger addressable market. Demand for advanced nodes isn’t going anywhere.

1lr3k7n,2025-07-03,2025-07-03 19:04:29,Remember the Great Tariff Panic of April 2025?,"Now that it’s a few months out and we’ve gotten to see things develop, I think it would be a helpful exercise to look back on the events surrounding “liberation day.” The Trump administration’s widespread tariff implementation caused a real ripple effect in markets, leading to sell offs by even seasoned investors. The panic found its way to this sub, among many others. 

While a minority cautioned steady investment practices, and not to panic, a large majority came here with incredibly bearish opinions, some verging on outright economic apocalypse. We were told it’s time to get out. That this isn’t a typical economic event, or pull back. That Europe, and other emerging markets, would be a better place for one’s money. 

Months later, we can definitively say none of that was true. Those who stuck to tried and true investment principles weathered the storm, and many who decided to buy the fear have seen impressive returns. US markets have been surging as of late. New trade deals have created a “news ladder,” resulting in many bullish days as we see positive news developments on trade. All this should serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of group think, and the lack of diverse opinions on these Reddit subs. Too many people allow their biases, mob mentality, and political sentiments to dictate important investing behavior. Pls use the memory of this event to listen to others you might disagree with and insulate your investment strategy going forward. Don’t allow fear, group think, and market events to derail tried and true investment methods.

• Net bookings €5.5B (€1.3B beat).  
• Net sales +23% Y/Y to €7.7B (€0.2B beat).  
• Gross margin 54% (+2pp Y/Y).  
• Operating margin 35% (+5pp Y/Y).  
• EPS €5.90 (€0.75 beat).  
• FY25 Net sales +15% Y/Y (narrower range).

**The reason for the stock dump?** ASML warning for no growth in 2026 due to tariffs. A typical Dutch response that love to have a pesimistic outlook and **prefer to underpromise and overdeliver.** 

**Reasons to be optimistic:**

1. **ASML has a history of being underpromising and overdelivering**. The last 3/4 earnings ASML beat expectations yet the stock price went down directly after due to pessimistic guidance. **A typical Dutch mentality/culture thing.**  
2. **Future Outlook (Net Bookings) is the biggest beat**: Net bookings which shows demand for the future was the biggest **beat by more than 30%** from 4.2B > 5.5B.
3. **ASML biggest customers are winning**: Nvidea and AMD just went sky high due to good news from selling in China. This means demand for ASML products will only increase. 

**Reasons to be pessimistic:** 

1. IF Trump and EU not make a deal then tariffs will indeed hurt ASML. However, this seems very unlikely. ASML is one of the most important companies for the US, without their chips the top 10 companies will have supply issues that cannot be solved for the next 5 years at least due to high barrier for entry needed to do what ASML does.

$LULU currently trades at 13.8x NTM PE. If they hit analyst estimates at $15.6 in FY27 with a PE of +20x (still below historic levels), then $LULU is a $312 stock.

  
**2. Novo Nordisk | $NVO**   
  
$NVO has had a difficult year but they have a very strong presence in the diabetes and weight loss industries. They're also investing heavily into growth in Denmark, France, and NC to ride the growing obesity market wave.   
  
Currently trading at 14.6x PE whilst historically trading around double that. $113 would be a 100% move.

  
**3. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals | $REGN**   
  
$REGN is a slightly higher growth value play with a current NTM PE in the 14x range whilst historically trading for +20x PE. P/B is also at 2.0x (historically +4.0x).  
  
With minimal debt and a current ratio above 7.0x, they're quite a safe play in a period of macro weakness. Their portfolio includes eye diseases (EYLEA), chronic inflammation (Dupixent), and cancers (Libtayo) which will all necessary despite economic conditions.   
  
I like $REGN a lot - it's on my watchlist.

  
**4. Constellation Brands | $STZ**   
  
A recent Buffett addition to his portfolio in Q2 - $STZ currently trades at a 11.9x PE and a 10.5x EBITDA multiple with a 2.5% dividend yield. The alcohol industry tends to be more resilient in downturns than most industries.   
  
If $STZ can return to historic PE multiples in the +15x range then they should be trading at $204 given a $13.6 EPS (as per analyst estimates in FY26/27).

  
**5. Merck & Co | $MRK**   
  
$MRK is currently trading at a NTM PE of 9.3x , which is very low historically and also lower than the broader healthcare sector.   
  
FCF has been steady and has generally traded upwards over the last few quarters reaching $1.68 per share in Q2. If $MRK can generate $9.61 in EPS in FY26 (in line with analyst estimates), and we apply a conservative 12x multiple then $MRK should be a $115 stock.   
  
Definitely a nice defensive play and an under the radar healthcare stock at the moment.

\- Derivative desks pulling risk

\- Dealers are compensating by widening bid/ask spreads

\- Vol-sellers are getting blown out

\- At least some hedge funds are running into **actual margin triggers**

1nsd54h,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 22:36:03,One of the best performing tech stocks of all time is on sale. And it’s not the Mag 7. Or even in the US.,"Constellation Software ($CSU.TO / $CNSWF) is experiencing a rare drawdown, in fact, the largest drawdown since IPO back in 2006. The founder, Mark Leonard, has been known as Canadas Warren Buffet, and is touted as one of the greatest capital allocators of all time. His shareholder letters are of renowned status, and anyone who has done any amount of research into the company knows the management quality is unparalleled. 

Constellation Software's compounding returns have quietly outshone almost every other stock since its IPO, cementing its place as one of the all-time great performers, all without being a member of the ""Magnificent Seven."" The company's unique, decentralized, long-term acquisition strategy for mission-critical vertical market software has created a fortress of recurring revenue. The services provided are known by shareholders to be sticky and switching costs are high. The company maintains relationships with potential acquisitions and holds a record of over 50,000 companies to potentially acquire. Since IPO, only one company has ever been re-sold, and Mark Leonard says this was one of his biggest regrets. 

I believe recent drawdown is entirely overblown. Skepticism over the impact of AI on its vast portfolio neglects Constellation's deep, embedded and entrenched specialized knowledge and systems in niche customer workflows—an enduring advantage against generalized AI tools. Furthermore, the stock's plunge following founder Mark Leonard's resignation for health reasons, though understandable given his legendary status, discounts the company's established, deep management bench and decentralized acquisition structure, which was built for perpetual operation beyond any single individual. The long-term thesis remains firmly intact. Mark Miller, the new CEO, himself has over 30 years with the company, leaving little doubt to his performance capabilities. 

The company typically commands a high premium, usually at 35-40x forward FCF. However, with last weeks intense sell off, the 2026E FCF multiple is currently in the low to mid 20s. I think this presents a very compelling opportunity for a company that has historically compounded at 20-30%. 

I believe this is a very rare buying opportunity. Next week, Constellation is holding a meeting to discuss the recent resignation of Mark Leonard. Volatility will likely remain high. I currently own 52 shares and will consider adding more in this dip.


**EDIT:**

Added below is one of the comments I made regarding what I believe is the root issue with the AI bear thesis - 

This is where the core issue of the AI arguement is: VMS will only lose value if they lose their customers.

I'm highly doubtful that artificial intelligence, any time in the near future, will upend and displace niche mission critical vertical market softwares. Typically, the cost of these vertical market softwares as a proportion of revenue generated from the business is one percent or less. There's no way that a municipality, utility, government agency or a healthcare facility (all common customers of CSU) will suddenly want to exchange deeply embedded VMS software for a new random vibe coded artificial intelligence mess, which will be riddled with bugs, issues, errors and inefficienceis. CSU's softwares have over the years been custom tailored and designed for each specific industry and business. Further, while AI has been shown to be decent at generating new code for simple programs, it's quite bad at debugging and fixing issues and errors. Like one commentor put it, good for greenfield, bad for brownfield. 

Imagine having to retrain hundreds of employees on how to use a new software that's been used by the business for the last fifteen to twenty years. Then fix all the new bugs, issues and inefficiencies on top of that. And remember when I said, the expense for this software is <1% of their revenue? Are they going to go through this headache? No.

Real world example - I work as a physical therapist with a home health agency. We still use a software on our company mobile devices called ""HomeCare HomeBase"" that was made for Blackberries with a keyboard and stylus for use by nurses 15 years ago. We still use it today and it's still one of the largest home health softwares used by home health agencies in the US. It's the same concept. For these businesses, switching out the software is just not worth the disruption in business operations for at best a minor operational efficiency improvement and practially no cost savings.

I used Duolingo to learn Spanish, and this app is total crap when it comes to efficiency and the speed of learning a new language. It’s made for idiots.

In the first chapter, you’re supposed to learn like 10 words.
For example: Spanish words like hello, cat, dog, tree, etc. And yeah, it’s super easy to remember those with flashcards  you could memorize them in two minutes. But this crappy app makes you repeat or fill in the blanks with the same words 10 times.

It gets annoying and becomes a huge waste of time, but you’re forced to complete these idiotic exercises just to unlock the next chapter. And in the next chapter, you learn another word.
Each chapter takes around 10 minutes  not because the words are hard to learn, but because of these dumb exercises that make you type the same word over and over.

This app is only for beginners to learn basic words. You’ll never reach B2 or C1 level using it, and to even get to the advanced chapters takes hours or days  only after grinding through all the crappy beginner monkey-level exercises.

The app won’t teach you how to actually speak. It wastes way too much time on this repetitive clicking nonsense.

Buying a book is way more efficient and faster. Nothing is locked, you decide which words to focus on, which ones are easy, and your learning time is much faster. You can flip to any chapter without being forced to unlock previous ones.

I seriously don’t understand how this Duolingo app is so highly valued, and why its stock went up like 20%. It’s a crappy app that doesn’t actually help you learn a language but waste  your time more than you spent  with book

Warren Buffett Turns 95 Today. 10 of His Biggest Investing Lessons

By Andrew Bary
Aug 30, 2025 1:30 am EDT

Warren Buffett celebrates his 95th birthday on Saturday—marking a milestone of longevity and leadership at Berkshire Hathaway.

Buffett plans to step down as Berkshire CEO at year’s end after 60 years at the helm. He leaves an extraordinary legacy as an investor and manager.


He took control of a struggling textile company in 1965 and has turned it into the world’s largest conglomerate with a market value of over $1 trillion and annual after-tax operating earnings of about $45 billion.

Here are 10 lessons, or takeaways, from his long career. Investors may not agree with some or many of them, but they are worth considering.

**Don’t pay up for stocks.** Buffett generally doesn’t pay more than 15 times forward earnings for a stock. Even when buying growth companies like Apple nearly a decade ago or Coca-Cola in the late 1980s, Buffett bought them for under 15 times earnings.

**Don’t be afraid to take profits—even if it means paying a lot in taxes.** While Buffett preaches “forever” investing, the reality is different. Berkshire has cut its formerly huge stake in Apple by 70% and reduced its interest in Bank of America by 40% over the past year or so. In recent years, Berkshire has exited sizable holdings in JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group, Citigroup and Paramount Global among others. The only two “forever” stocks in the Berkshire portfolio could be Coke and American Express.

Story by Kantaro Komiya

TOKYO (Reuters) -Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway raised its holdings in five Japanese trading houses, regulatory filings showed on Monday, in the U.S. conglomerate's latest investments in Japan's top commodity firms that began nearly five years ago.

Berkshire's stake in Mitsui & Co rose to 9.82% from 8.09%, while its holdings in Mitsubishi Corp, Sumitomo Corp, Itochu and Marubeni also rose by some percentage points, according to documents filed to Japan's securities watchdog by its unit, National Indemnity Company.

The filings followed Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire shareholders last month, where he said the five trading houses agreed to ""moderately relax"" limits that capped Berkshire's ownership stakes below 10%.

""Over time, you will likely see Berkshire's ownership of all five increase somewhat,"" Buffett had written.

Known as ""sogo shosha"", the trading houses deal in a variety of materials, products and food - often serving as intermediaries - and provide logistical support. They are also involved in the shipping, energy and metals businesses.

Here are links to the Japanese filings (***yes, they're in Japanese***).

I completely disagree and I want to share some of my input which may help people on this subreddit better understand where Reddit's valuation is today.

In simple terms, Reddit's valuation is very high. So, let's do back-of-the-napkin math where I assume an ultra-bull case. See below for my assumptions:

* Revenue grows 30% CAGR for the next 5 years. It reaches $4.75 billion in 2029. (Analysts expect 20-25% CAGR for next 5 years)
* Reddit has a profit margin of 30%. (This is an ultra-bull case - Meta has 34%, Google has 23%)
* In 2029, Reddit is a more mature company and trades at a valuation of 30 PE (Meta - 29 today, Google - 25 today)
* I completely ignore share dilution and taxes in this valuation just to make it more bullish. (This would drop valuation by about 20-30%)

So, assuming $4.75 billion with a 30% margin, gives a margin of $1.425 billion. If we multiply this by 30 times earnings, we get a $42 billion dollar valuation. Today, Reddit is valued at $30 billion. Assuming this unrealistic ultra-bull scenario is right, you would only achieve a 7% CAGR growth on your investment for a lot of risk.

So, how exactly is this a value investment? I wouldn't even consider it a good growth investment either.",313,305,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1hf3d7p/devils_advocate_reddit_stock_is_not_a_buy_and_is/,year,Stock Analysis,0.9

Netflix Earnings Show That YouTube Is the Streamer to Fear



[https://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-earnings-alphabet-youtube-658104fa](https://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-earnings-alphabet-youtube-658104fa)



By Adam Levine

Over the past few years, Netflix has vanquished the likes of Walt Disney, [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com), and Apple in the battle to become the top videostreamer. Yet it’s slipping behind the company that has emerged as its biggest competitor: Alphabet’s YouTube.



This was hammered home on Thursday when Netflix reported second-quarter results. It earnings per share surged 47%. And according to Nielsen, its share of U.S. viewers remained at 8.3%—almost twice as high as all of the Disney channels combined.



The problem: YouTube’s share of U.S. viewers grew to 12.8% from 9.9% a year earlier. Whereas Netflix creates much of its own content and relies primarily on subscriptions, YouTube follows a different model that’s built on user-generated content and advertising.



Increasingly, Netflix is squaring off against YouTube while the rest of the streamers compete with one another.

I have a watchlist of companies I would love to own at the right price, but everything just seems so expensive.

The buffet indicator (public equity values over GDP) is well over 200%, which is currently uncharted territory. I’m sitting on way too much cash but with what I view at high valuations and a supporting indicator like this I have a hard time getting comfortable deploying it.

1legydd,2025-06-18,2025-06-18 09:21:03,"When insiders buy big after years of silence, I pay attention","One of the first things I check when analyzing a company is whether insiders own stock, and more importantly, if they’re buying more. It’s not just about ""aligning interests"", it’s about showing conviction. When someone from the inside puts real money on the line, especially during rough times, that speaks louder than any earnings call.

Recent example: Plug Power. After the stock tanked over 50% YTD, CFO Paul Middleton bought 650,000 shares at $1.03 in June 2025. Just weeks earlier, he had already grabbed 350,000 shares at $0.72. That’s over 900,000 shares bought on the open market in less than a month.

To be clear, this isn't a guarantee of anything. Insider buying is just one signal, and not a magical green light. But when someone with full access to the internals is betting big at these levels, I can't ignore it. At the very least, it makes me want to dig deeper and recheck the thesis.

Do you factor insider buying into your process? Ever had it lead you to a big win or a trap?

Time and time again contrarian views caution staying away and time and time again recovery always shows. Unless we're caught in the middle of a FNMA / Bear Stearns catastrophe from 2008... which if that is a concern you should not be holding any equities to begin with in this climate.

I bought the dump on COVID era crash, I bought the dump on SPY in 490s zone, it all worked out. Sure, past performances do not reflect future performances but what else have we got?

Now I'm not arguing for a full V shaped recovery all the way to the 500s and that you stay with this stock for years or even decades but 350-380 is definitely reasonable given the tenets of this subreddit.

Just wanted some discussion with people who disagree with me. Thank you.

edit: Of course, downvotes before discussion above all else. Classic Reddit..

edit 2: thank you to all those who participated in the discussion, keep the downvotes coming.

From what I've gathered from naysayers  
\- ""You have no evidence that the price is going to go up!"" while not elaborating on why they think so

edit 3: redditors do tend to have a habit of demanding anyone making a DD or a claim to be a messiah, that they have to provide all evidence, and if any evidence is provided, it will be crucified. Relax guys, its just a discussion. We are all adults and can agree to disagree... right?

**edit 4: ""Its a value trap! You do not know what you're talking about. Did you even do your research? I disagree with you"" - Redditor who refuses to elaborate further and gets angry**

Firstly, Eli Lilly ($LLY) is eating their lunch. Their rival drug, Zepbound, is clinically proven to be significantly more effective for weight loss.

Secondly they're fighting a guerrilla war with copycats: Unregulated ""compounding"" pharmacies are selling cheap, knockoff versions of the drug, hitting sales and brand integrity hard. 

Finally a crisis of confidence is taking place. Management slashed their financial outlook twice in three months and swapped CEOs, making them look like they've lost control. 

So, is it a falling knife to be avoided at all costs? I argue NO. The market has panicked, and the stock is now trading at a valuation not seen in decades, with a P/E ratio of around 13.This is a cash-printing machine with insane profit margins and a promising pipeline of next-gen drugs.

1g2i3g0,2024-10-13,2024-10-13 00:47:27,For those wondering if we're in a bull market.... ,"COST, a high volume retail store, trades at 50x forward earnings while CRWD, which literally brought the country to a halt a few months ago, trades at 75x forward earnings.  Both have PE/G ratios over 3 (1 is considered fair value).

The total market cap of the S&P is 2.0x US GDP (vs. historical norm: 0.75x-1x) while the P/E 10, i.e., Shiller's CAPE, is over 100% above its arithmetic mean and over 120% above its geometric mean.

While the US will continue to ""quiet"" default through non-stop printing, total government debt to US GDP recently surpassed 100%, which suggests it's only a matter of time before the bond markets start to push back with higher rates at the long end of the yield curve.

As they say, you can't call the waves but you can time the tides.

Is anyone adjusting their asset allocation, portfolio or going hmmm based on these metrics?

Note: if you disagree, please explain your valuation methodology and how you conclude a stock (or market) is fairly valued vs overvalued.  Just saying ""people have been saying the market is overvalued for years"" or ""a correction is coming"" doesn't really address my argument unless your opinion is valuation is no longer relevant because the Fed will just keep printing until kingdom come, which is probably true.


I'm overwhelmed by all the comments regardless of the view they expressed. Thanks for expressing your thoughts and allowing me to share mine.

1mmistk,2025-08-10,2025-08-10 09:37:44,Why Apple is the world's most obvious Value Trap,"Everyone sees Apple as the ultimate safe stock, but my analysis shows it's a classic value trap waiting to spring. Its premium $3T valuation is dangerously disconnected from a new reality of stagnating growth, mounting threats, and a faltering innovation engine.

And before anyone says it's not a value trap, the term ‘value trap’ often conjures images of beaten-down, statistically cheap stocks that lure in value investors only to fall further. But the worst traps are not the ones that look cheap; they are the ones that still look magnificent. A true value trap is a company whose premium valuation is dangerously disconnected from a deteriorating reality. It persuades investors with the ghost of past glories, a powerful brand, and a reputation for invincibility that masks the grim reality of stagnating growth and mounting existential threats. Investors keep paying for a future that the fundamentals can no longer support.

Now here's why I think Apple is one:

Firstly, Apple is trading at a P/E ratio over 30, a price you'd pay for a high-growth innovator. But its revenue growth is projected to be a sluggish 4-6%.You can get double or triple that growth from Microsoft or Google for a similar or lower price. The numbers don't justify the premium. 

Next, the iPhone, which is over half their revenue, has hit a wall. Sales are flat or declining. Their once-unstoppable growth in China is now a major headache, where they're being forced into price wars with Huawei, sacrificing their legendary profit margins just to hold on to market share. 

Apple also isn't inventing the future anymore. They just cancelled their decade-long, multi-billion dollar car project. The Vision Pro, hyped as the next big thing, has been a commercial flop with demand cratering. And in the most important race of our time, AI, they are years behind competitors. 

Finally, the ""walled garden"" that generates their high-margin Services revenue is under a coordinated global attack. The US Department of Justice, the EU's Digital Markets Act, and new laws in Japan are all aimed at dismantling the App Store's monopoly power. The entire Services growth story is at risk.  

The market is still pricing Apple based on the company it *was*, not the company it *is*. The fundamentals are flashing red across the board, but investors are blinded by the brand. It's a textbook value trap, and a painful repricing feels inevitable.

1kfp0rn,2025-05-05,2025-05-05 18:33:00,Warren Buffett is not retiring for good as Berkshire board votes to keep him as chairman,"From CNBC:

>The Berkshire Hathaway board voted unanimously on Sunday to make Greg Abel president and CEO on Jan. 1, 2026, and for Warren Buffett, 94, to remain as chairman, the company said.

>Buffett shocked Berkshire shareholders and Abel by announcing in the final minutes of the company’s annual shareholder meeting Saturday that he would be asking the board to replace him as CEO at year-end with the current vice chairman of noninsurance operations for Berkshire.

>Buffett, who is both chairman and CEO, did not make it clear at the time whether this would mean he would relinquish the chairman title as well, although he did say he would be hanging around to help where he could. Buffett did make clear that the final word on company operations and capital deployment would be with Abel, 62, when this transition takes place.

>However, with Buffett staying as chairman, shareholders may be comforted that the “Oracle of Omaha” will remain to help Abel with any big acquisition opportunities that may arise in possible volatile markets ahead as the conglomerate Buffett took over in 1965 sits on more than $347 billion in cash.

>“I could be helpful, I believe, in that in certain respects, if we ran into periods of great opportunity or anything,” Buffett said on Saturday.

Buffett still retains a role at Berkshire.

1mtvzov,2025-08-18,2025-08-18 15:31:28,One of the most selective investors ever is buying Crocs and PayPal,"Norbert Lou is the founder of Punch Card Capital and easily one of the most selective investors of all time. 

Joel Greenblatt found him in 2001 because he was posting some legendary writeups on Value Investor's Club and gave him money to manage. Very similar to the Michael Burry story in that way. 

Lou has tried to stay out of the limelight as much as possible, but he had maybe one of the best single stock investments I've ever heard of when he bought NVR in 1997 at \~$23/share. Today, it trades at roughly $8,150. That's a 353-bagger.

He literally turned his mom's tiny retirement money into a fortune off of this one investment. 

Anyways, he's basically only held 3-4 stocks at any one time for the last decade and he just started 2 brand new positions for the first time in forever, **Crocs** and **Paypal.** 

**Crocs is trading at 8x FCF**. It's stupid cheap if can continue to grow, but they just pulled guidance on tariff concerns so could be rough in the short-term. 

Paypal has been in no man's land for 5 years now.

Googles only downfall is they are morons at advertising and monetizing the tech they have available. Eventually people will figure it out. There is so much potential in the stock outside of search and advertising. I think the recent tech conference is going to do some heavy lifting for Google. A great future outlook and a resilient stock to own through tariffs. I view Google as a monopolistic tech behemoth at this point. While Meta and Apple make widgets, google is creating an irreplaceable monopoly.

Google VEO 3 is absurd and will disrupt/enhance the U.S. film industry.

Waymo is and will continue to grow at an insane rate.

Negatives: The DOJ case and the replacement of search on Apple devices. Googles inability to price to consumers, the 250/month package is weird and not really tailored appropriately to anyone. They need to rethink how they price their other services outside of ads, plain and simple. I hope there is some increased focus on the business side to really see Google grow.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ku780b/gemini\_has\_inflated\_numbers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ku780b/gemini_has_inflated_numbers/)

>Counting every AI powered snippet in Search as a Gemini interaction is inflating the numbers and turning an apples to oranges comparison into something that sounds more impressive than it really is. This only proves my thesis that I am bearish on Google.

**TL,DR/Intro:** Gemini and AI overview numbers are separate, this user didn't do any research & based their opinion on anecdotal comments instead of looking at data. My own personal *opinion* is that Google is currently winning the AI race, and will win in the future, as they simply have access to more compute and models which offer more/equal performance for similar/lower cost of compute. In addition, as others have mentioned, Google has a far greater variety of platforms with which they can integrate Gemini into, further incentivizing usage of the Google product suite and google ecosystem.

**Going deeper (Showing evidence):**

Gemini app usage is \~350 million users a month: [https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/google-gemini-has-350m-monthly-users-reveals-court-hearing/](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/google-gemini-has-350m-monthly-users-reveals-court-hearing/)

>Gemini, Google’s AI chatbot, had 350 million monthly active users around the globe as of March, according to internal data revealed in Google’s ongoing antitrust suit.

AI Overviews usage is \~1.5 billion users a month, under ""Search"" subheading: [https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q1-2025/#search](https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q1-2025/#search)

>In Search, we saw continued double digit revenue growth. AI Overviews is going very well with over 1.5 billion users per month, and we’re excited by the early positive reaction to AI Mode.

Gemini vs ChatGPT benchmarks: [https://livebench.ai/#/](https://livebench.ai/#/)

* For this, compare Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google's most powerful reasoning model) to o3 High (OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model): 78 Overall vs 80 Overall
* And compare Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google's faster, more affordable model) to o4-mini medium (OpenAI's more affordable model). 72 vs 74.5 overall
* However, a more fair comparison would be between the models free users can get with Google and OpenAI. For Google, free users get access to Gemini 2.5 Pro & Flash, while free users for ChatGPT only get limited access to ChatGPT-4o (Overall 64.65 score).
* Sources: [https://chatgpt.com/#pricing](https://chatgpt.com/#pricing), and [https://platform.openai.com/docs/models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for how I drew the comparisons.

**Gemini vs ChatGPT Compute Costs**: Gemini compute costs for Google are far less than OpenAI's, demonstrating Google has more cost-efficient models, important for scalability and profitability down the line. Gemini is also trained on Google TPUs while OpenAI relies on Nvidia hardware, which as we all know is sold at a premium.

For example: Gemini 2.5 Pro compute costs per 1M tokens = $17.50, assuming large input and output prompts. OpenAI's comparable model, o3, costs $25.00 when batching prompts (sending prompts all at once) or $52.50 when not using Batch API. When you look at Flash pricing vs GPT 4.1 pricing, the disparity is even worse considering Flash outperforms GPT 4.1 on Livebench.

* [https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o3](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o3)
* Add Input/Output costs - regardless of context costs price difference is still in favor of Google

Further: Google used Trillium TPUs to train Gemini 2.0, and likely used it to train Gemini 2.5 as well.

1kez2cr,2025-05-04,2025-05-04 20:45:26,PLTR: The Most Overvalued Stock in History,"While everyone’s focused on Nvidia as the most overvalued stock of this cycle, the real bubble is Palantir.

Palantir is sitting at a price to sales ratio of 100, making it the most expensive large cap stock ever on a revenue basis. At an almost $300 billion market cap with 34% revenue growth and less than $3B in sales for all of 2024, the stock’s valuation is completely disconnected from its fundamentals.

Here's a table of the most overvalued large cap stocks I could find throughout history, sorted by date of the peak P/S ratio along with P/E a year later and change in revenue, EPS, and share price in the year following the peak valuation (I worked all weekend on this unfortunately):

![img](s3lyvzswauye1)

**Nvidia**

Nvidia’s valuation was insane and the growth was even crazier. That was a once in lifetime growth story, and PLTR is somehow priced much higher.

**Tesla**

Tesla’s 1,400 P/E in 2021 looks insane but EPS exploded the next year and the valuation normalized. Palantir doesn’t have anywhere close to that growth coming.

**Cisco**

Cisco is a better comparison. It crashed over 80% during the dotcom bubble pop and never returned to those levels. PLTR is more expensive with weaker growth and is somehow projected for less revenue growth than Cisco saw throughout that 80% stock decline.

**Zoom**

The closest comparison is Zoom, which peaked with a P/S of 106 in late 2020. Zoom went on to grow revenue at 170% and EPS at 319% over the next year. Despite that insane growth (much higher than what Palantir is projected to do), the stock still dropped 45% in that time, then bottomed nearly 90% from its highs. Palantir is trading at a similar valuation with significantly less growth. 2021 was also a euphoric market year, while we’re at the beginning of a market-wide bubble pop.

Palantir is more expensive than Zoom at its peak valuation (at the beginning of one of the most euphoric market periods we’ve ever seen) with much less projected growth. It is also trading far above Nvidia’s peak multiples despite Nvidia growing more than 6x faster on revenue and 4x faster on EPS.

**Conspiracies**

Palantir’s surge is driven by AI hype and retail euphoria. I saw bulls on Twitter calling for the stock to 10x in five years which is ridiculous. Some of the hype is also based on a weird conspiracy that Trump is going to pump it or Peter Thiel is going to enslave us all with AI. I have no idea where that comes from and I’m 99% sure that everyone blindly parroting these claims has no idea what Palantir actually does either.

Every stock in the table above showed strong revenue and earnings growth in the 12 months after their peak valuation. That didn’t stop the crashes. Valuations eventually matter. Palantir will keep growing but not anywhere near fast enough to justify this kind of multiple.

tl;dr: Palantir is talked about like the next Nvidia, but it’s the next Cisco or Zoom. I have no idea how this stock is above $20 a share.",264,92,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1kez2cr/pltr_the_most_overvalued_stock_in_history/,year,Stock Analysis,0.89

Interesting note:

Kodak now has 1.4 Billion in cash after they sold the excess from the pension. They only have 400 million in debt. 

They could literally pay off all their debt and still have a billion in cash.

And the market cap is only… 532 million. That means the amount of cash they have is more than twice their market cap.

They’re also profitable and revenue exceeds 1 billion a year.

They could announce a $1 special dividend and it would only cost 60 million…. Stock is heavily shorted…

1mhaxab,2025-08-04,2025-08-04 07:32:14,I just bought 1000 shares in INTC,"You probably think I'm nuts, but I have a very rational DD, I promise.

Firstly, the tangible book value is $16.20 per share. The company could be sold off piecemeal and I'd only be down $3000. That's a pretty attractive risk floor...

Now the investment asymetry:

INTC sold off recently after announcing that if customers don’t show up, they may pause 14A investments or shift focus - which would effectively kill the U.S. onshore foundry roadmap.

You have to read behind the lines here...

Essentially, they are telling Trump:

""If onshore fab is strategic (both economically and militarily), then FORCE the customers to buy from us!""

TSM are likely to face tariffs soon. The results of the Section 232 semiconductor probe are essentially inevitable and clearly justified by national security - so tariffs could be as high as 50% considering that angle.

If tariffs hit, companies like NVDA, AAPL, and AMD will have no alternative but to consider Intel Foundry - which then becomes a national chokepoint.

I'm an electronic engineer...so let’s talk technology...

I know INTC hasn't been profitable recently - but the semiconductor industry is all about long-term investments. It takes 10-15 years of horizon planning. Much of the outcome you're seeing from NVDA was due to this long term approach.

Intel's earlier investments into technology such as 14A and PowerVia put them potentially 1-2 years ahead of the competition.

Routing power behind the chip is a HUGE density breakthrough, simplifying design and improving performance.

High-NA EUV allows for greater fidelity without multiple exposures. Note that INTC was the first to take delivery of the new lithography machines from ASML and they have first-customer priority over TSM. 

INTC isn't behind on tech, they're ahead...

Currently, TSM have to do multiple lithography exposures to get the fidelity they need. It's more expensive than necessary. They are nearing the physical limits of their current production cycle...

TLDR: Intel has both the regulatory and tech advantages to dominate foundry for the next decade - while trading at close to tangible book value! Currently trading near the technical floor price...

\- Tesla recalls virtually all [46,000 cybertrucks](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recall-over-46000-cybertrucks-nhtsa-says-2025-03-20/). Their 8th recall in the last 14 months.

\- Tesla is STILL after being down 50%, at a trailing 12 month P/E of 122x today March 24th. This is compared to 40x P/E for NVDA (probably a leading indicator of AI beneficiaries) and 52 p/e for BYD (probably closest electric car comparison). 

  
This is ignoring subjective truths like [Tesla being years behind Waymo](https://www.ainvest.com/news/tesla-overvalued-as-waymo-s-quiet-ride-gains-momentum-in-autonomous-race-24101010e8fcc0b6dde52a76/) in the autonomous driving division, the fact that even consumers who aren't anti Musk are worried about the stigma and damage to their cars ([it's hard to even offload a used tesla](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/20/business/even-used-teslas-are-falling-out-of-favor/index.html)), the fairly [credible accusations of fraud ](https://www.carscoops.com/2025/03/hundreds-of-tesla-evs-pile-up-in-canadian-parking-lots-after-suspicious-sales-rush/)in a mysterious and massive purchase of Teslas in Canada ahead EV tax rebate expiring. And ignoring the simple truth that after years of expounding the virtue of gas cars, Trump and Hannity aren't going to get conservative to pick up the slack in sales as liberals ditch EVs over musk digust. 

  
In what world does Tesla beat out superior, cheaper cars in China, overcome huge political boycotts in America, Europe and Canada, overtake Waymo in autonomous driving, all while covering their losses from a massively underperforming cybertruck and Elon doing everything in his power to both be distracted and burn tesla's reputation to the ground? The amount of growth for a company of this size would have to achieve to justify a 120x P/E is simply not feasible unless there was zero competition in a huge growing market, but even companies like Nvidia are 1/3 the P/E of tesla. 

Please poke holes in this theory.

1k51q3d,2025-04-22,2025-04-22 05:00:23,"Financial Times: The US, not others, will feel most pain from its economic mistakes","It is time to retire the phrase: “When America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold.” Said to have first been used in relation to Napoleonic France, that idiom lost its value after Waterloo. Donald Trump is about to destroy its modern equivalent. In foreign policy, the president’s choice no longer to be a reliable ally providing trusted security guarantees is a seismic change. It ensures that other countries will now be less willing to accept US demands.

But it is on the economic front that hubris is most likely to result in humility for a country that has long since lost its status as the world’s largest producer of goods and services. It is not just that Trump’s negotiating hand with tariffs is much weaker than he imagines. It is that the rest of the world controls 85 per cent of the global economy and no longer has to follow whatever the US does. Provided cool heads prevail in global commerce, the hotheads in the White House will not dominate the landscape.

This century, America’s share of global goods imports has fallen from 19 per cent to 13 per cent, according to World Bank figures. These figures probably understate the country’s true importance because imports and exports along supply chains often end up as US final demand (for example, if Chinese batteries are supplied to European electric vehicles and bought by Americans), but its share of global commerce is undoubtedly falling. 

The White House might seek to generate a sense of global economic dominance, bringing other countries into line for fear of the consequences. But what this century has taught us is that few crises are actually global. For sure, few economies emerged from the global financial crisis or the Covid pandemic unscathed. But there have been many more localised economic crises that did not infect the rest of the world. Brexit and the Liz Truss episode were confined to the UK. The Eurozone bore the vast brunt of its 2010-12 sovereign debt crisis. Europe alone suffered from natural gas shortages and price surges in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Globalisation is far from complete.

The US is a sovereign nation and free to destroy its part in the global economic rules-based system it created. But in setting high tariffs and flip-flopping on them, spreading fear among immigrants and undermining the effectiveness of the US government, the policies will hit hardest at home. The stagflationary shock of generating huge business uncertainties and higher imported goods prices puts the Federal Reserve in a bind. It is struggling to articulate whether to worry more about higher unemployment or rising prices.

But the inflationary effects of Trump’s tariffs hit mostly in the US. Other countries facing a demand shock can simply offset this with looser policy. Of course, there will be some collateral damage. Countries with high export shares in GDP and with the US as a very large trading partner — think Canada and Mexico — are more vulnerable. Smaller economies that export food and basic goods such as T-shirts to America are also likely to be hit hard.

But when economists calibrate their models and look at the underlying realities, it is the US that looks weak. Consensus Economics, which collates private-sector forecasts, shows that economists on average expect the US economy to grow almost a percentage point less in 2025 than at the time of Trump’s inauguration, and 2026 does not look much better. Eurozone and Chinese GDP forecasts have been trimmed by far less. 

This week, finance ministers and central bank governors will convene in Washington for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings. There is often one country at such gatherings that has earned pariah status. No doubt fingers will point at the US this year. The only question is how polite other countries choose to be.

1i3ayjt,2025-01-17,2025-01-17 02:16:32,Uber is undervalued - DD,"# Full Disclosure

This is my first attempt at a deep dive (DD), and I’m a long-time lurker in r/valueinvesting who wanted to give it a shot! I’m currently in the first year of my Bachelor's in Finance, and I have a small position in Uber (just a half position). I plan to soon increase it to a full-sized position. With that said, let's dive in!

# The Technicals

Challenges in Comparing Uber’s Technicals

I found it challenging to compare Uber directly with its competitors. While Uber does face competition from companies like Google (Waymo) and Tesla, both are highly diversified, which makes it difficult to draw direct comparisons. Additionally, DoorDash focuses on food delivery, which is just one segment of Uber’s business, making it an imperfect comparison. Thus, I will focus on analyzing Uber on its own merits.

# Key Technicals

* Current Forward P/E Ratio: 26.18
   * The P/E ratio has been steadily falling over the last three quarters, which suggests the stock is normalizing in valuation.
      * Current Quarter: 26.18 (17% drop from the previous quarter)
      * 9/30/24: 31.55 (45.1% drop)
      * 6/30/24: 57.47 (4.6% drop)
      * 3/31/24: 60.24
* Interpretation:
   * The consistent drop in P/E ratios reflects a more balanced valuation for Uber. The stock price has recently bottomed out around $60 per share and is now bouncing back to about $70, indicating strong support levels at (per barchart):
      * $67.14
      * $66.55
      * $65.68

# Free Cash Flow & Yield

* Current Free Cash Flow Yield (FCFY): 4.33%
   * Market Average: 3.6% (Uber outperforms the market in terms of cash flow yield).
   * CFO Statement: Uber’s CFO highlighted that the stock is undervalued relative to the strength of the business and plans to accelerate buybacks under the existing authorization.
   * Free Cash Flow: Uber reported over $6 billion in free cash flow, surpassing Tesla’s $3.6 billion.

# Userbase & Revenue Growth

* Revenue Growth: Uber’s revenue grew by nearly 17% in 2024.
* Trips: Uber achieved 10.8 billion trips in the past 12 months, representing 20% growth from the previous year.

* Userbase Growth: Uber’s userbase grew by 13% year-over-year.

# 2024 Performance

* Uber has underperformed in 2024, largely due to concerns about increased competition, particularly from Tesla and Waymo, as well as the potential impact of autonomous vehicles (AVs).

# Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)

* While many believe AVs will disrupt Uber’s business, I actually see them as a potential opportunity for Uber. By adopting AV technology, Uber could reduce driver-related expenses and enhance operational efficiency, resulting in lower costs and improved profitability.

# Competition with Tesla and Waymo

* Tesla:
   * Tesla does not yet have a ride-hailing service outside of its own employees and does not plan to launch a beta program until late 2025. Even then, it will be limited to only two states. So they are quite far away from establishing any sort of competition that could threaten Uber's market share.
* Waymo:
   * Waymo already has a partnership with Uber in select cities, where Waymo’s autonomous vehicles operate through Uber’s platform, paying Uber a royalty for access to its network. This partnership suggests that competitors like Waymo may be more inclined to work with Uber rather than challenge it. Some may point out that Waymo has plans to operate without Uber in certain cities, however I think they are just doing their own due diligence and once they realize how much of an asset Uber's userbase is they will revert to working with Uber, not against them.

# Long-Term Scenario

* I believe that as AV technology matures, competitors will come to realize the value of Uber’s large userbase. Google’s Waymo already seems to recognize this, and as more companies adopt AVs, it is likely that they will partner with Uber, rather than competing directly with the platform.

# Ridesharing Industry Growth Outlook (2025-2030)

* Over the next five years, the ridesharing industry is projected to more than double in size, from $98 billion in 2025 to over $200 billion by 2030.
   * This growth presents a tremendous opportunity for Uber, as the overall market expansion will likely benefit dominant players like Uber who can maintain strong market share.

# Uber’s Position in the Market

* As previously mentioned, I don’t see autonomous vehicles (AVs) as a significant threat to Uber’s market share. While AVs will likely have an impact in the long run, I believe Uber is well-positioned to retain its dominant market share.
* If Uber can maintain around 70% market share, even though this would be below its historical average since 2015, it will continue to be a major winner as the market expands.

# New and Innovative Revenue Streams

Uber has been actively exploring and expanding into new revenue streams beyond its core ridesharing and food delivery services. Some of these initiatives include:

1. Uber Freight: Uber Freight marks the company’s entry into the logistics sector. It connects trucking companies with shippers needing freight transportation, leveraging Uber’s technology to streamline the freight and shipping process. This growing platform opens up a significant revenue opportunity in the freight industry.
2. Uber for Business: Uber for Business enables companies to manage transportation for employees, clients, or guests. This program provides a way for businesses to integrate Uber into their travel management systems, offering a convenient solution for corporate clients and generating additional revenue from business customers.
3. Uber Health: Uber Health is a specialized service that allows healthcare providers to arrange transportation for patients. This service is particularly useful for individuals who need to get to medical appointments but may lack access to a personal vehicle. As healthcare services continue to grow, Uber Health has the potential to become an important revenue stream for Uber.
4. Uber Ads: Uber Ads allows advertisers to partner with Uber to use in-car screens for advertising. This emerging revenue stream could offer significant monetization opportunities, particularly as Uber’s ridesharing fleet continues to grow and more riders are exposed to in-vehicle advertisements.

# Conclusion

Uber is a solid growth company and a great value investment. I believe that Uber will continue to branch out into other industries and innovate along the way. The current stock price appears to reflect an undervalued valuation, especially considering Uber’s strong free cash flow, and consistent revenue growth. Despite competition, Uber’s large userbase, market share, and partnerships give it a strong competitive advantage in the long term. I plan to increase my position in Uber, as I believe the stock has reached a bottom and will likely rise to $90 per share by the end of the year. My position is currently 15.19 shares at an average cost per share of $61.98.",255,135,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1i3ayjt/uber_is_undervalued_dd/,year,Stock Analysis,0.86
1ngzm6d,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 14:57:36,Comparing 3 Studies on Multibagger Stocks,"Decided to compare research from three studies about stocks that return 10-100x+ your money and share my findings here.

Here's what I read through:

* Christopher Mayer: ""100 Baggers"" (2015); Covered 1962-2014.
* Jenga Investment Partners (Dede Eyesan): ""Global Outperformers"" (2023); Covered 2012-2022.
* Anna Yartseva: ""The Alchemy of Multibagger Stocks"" (2025); Covered 2009-2024.

Clearly, these aren't apples-to-apples comparisons. Besides the time period differences, Mayer looked at 100-baggers using case studies. Jenga performed academic research on 446 global 10-baggers (not just US stocks), and Yartseva used statistical models on 464 NYSE and NASDAQ-traded stocks. These studies may suffer from survivorship bias as well.

Regardless, I think it's an interesting comparison to potentially understand recurring themes/patterns and identify any surprising findings.

# What Doesn't Matter

**Earnings Growth**

One of the most surprising findings was on earnings growth and how many investors/books say it's essential, including Mayer.

However, Yartseva's statistical analysis found that earnings growth was NOT a significant predictor of multibagger returns.

Specifically, she tested EPS growth, EBITDA growth, gross profit growth, operating profit (EBIT) growth, and net profit growth over both 1-year and 5-year periods. None were statistically significant in her dynamic panel regression models.

Interestingly, while Yartseva found earnings growth wasn't predictive, her winners still achieved impressive growth rates: 17.3% CAGR in operating profit, 22.9% in net profit, and 20.0% in EPS.

Eyesan found the average profitable company grew operating earnings at 20% CAGR.

**Industry**

Yartseva's 464 multibaggers came from several sectors, not just tech:

Information Technology (20%), Industrials (19%), Consumer Discretionary (18%), Healthcare (14%), and even traditionally slow-growth sectors like Utilities (1%).

Eyesan found similar sector diversity among his 446 global outperformers: Information Technology led with 25.8%, followed by Industrials (15.2%), Healthcare (14.1%), Materials (13.5%), and Consumer Discretionary (10.5%).

Notably, Information Technology, Healthcare, and Materials outperformed relative to their market representation. Tech represented 25.8% of winners but only 12.7% of the overall market. Semiconductors alone jumped from 1 outperformer in 2002-2012 to 44 in 2012-2022.

This broad distribution suggests screening by sector would eliminate many opportunities.

**Other Factors**

Yartseva's research also found several widely-tracked metrics showed no predictive power:

* Dividend policies (58% of multibaggers paid dividends at start, 78% by end - no correlation).
* Debt levels (debt-to-equity and debt-to-capital ratios didn't predict returns).
* Share buybacks (no statistical significance).
* Analyst coverage (being followed or ignored didn't matter).
* Altman Z-scores for bankruptcy risk (failed statistical tests).
* R&D spending relative to free cash flow (surprisingly no correlation with becoming a multibagger).

# What Actually Matters

**Company Size**

Every single study found that smaller companies outperform:

* Mayer: Median $500M market cap, with median sales of $170M.
* Eyesan: Found 63% of winners were nano-caps (<$50M market cap) in 2012, with only 7/446 winners (1.6%) being large caps.
* Yartseva: $348M median market cap in 2009, with median revenue of $702M. Notably, Yartseva found that small-cap stocks generated average excess returns of 37.7% annually, compared to 14.5% for mid-caps and 9.7% for large-caps.

This makes logical sense given it's easier to grow from a small base - a $100M company doubling is much easier than a $100B company doubling.

**Moats**

All three studies agreed on competitive advantages/moats. Companies need something protecting their profits from competition:

* Mayer: Emphasized economic moats as essential for durability. ""A 100-bagger requires a high return on capital for a long time. A moat, by definition, is what allows a company to get that return.""
* Eyesan: Found that outperformers typically had or developed competitive advantages.
* Yartseva: While acknowledging competitive advantages were important based on prior literature, she didn't isolate this as a specific variable in her models, instead incorporating it into overall business quality metrics.

**Patience**

They also agreed on patience:

* Mayer: 100-baggers took 26 years on average. Also emphasized the ""coffee-can"" portfolio philosophy.
* Eyesan: All 446 global outperformers achieved their 10-bagger status within 10 years (2012-2022 study period).
* Yartseva: 10-baggers ranged from 7.5 to 40.5 years, with her 464 stocks averaging 26-fold returns (21.4% CAGR) over 15 years.

**Revenue Growth**

Revenue growth was discussed across all studies:

* Mayer: Emphasized the need for significant growth but didn't specify a minimum rate.
* Eyesan: Found 15% CAGR average revenue growth in his winners.
* Yartseva: Found 11.1% CAGR median revenue growth in her winners.

**FCF Yield & Book Value**

Yartseva's statistical model confirmed free cash flow (FCF) to price ratio as the most important driver of multibagger stock outperformance.

In her regression models, FCF/P showed coefficients ranging from 46 to 82, while book-to-market (B/M) showed coefficients from 7 to 42. Together, a 1% increase in FCF/P and B/M ratios was associated with 7-52% higher annual returns.

FCF/P captures both the company's cash generation and what you're paying for it.

B/M ratios above 0.40 combined with positive operating profitability showed higher chances of positive returns in Yartseva's portfolio sorts.

However, Yartseva warns to avoid companies with negative equity (where liabilities exceed assets). Small-cap companies w/negative equity declined 18.1% annually, medium-caps fell 9.4%, and large-caps dropped 7.6%.

**Other Valuation Metrics**

Yartseva's winners started with median valuations of P/S 0.6, P/B 1.1, forward P/E 11.3, and PEG 0.8, all suggesting they were undervalued at the start.

Eyesan found that 48.9% of outperformers started trading below 10x EV/EBIT and 50.7% below 1x EV/Revenue, suggesting most winners begin at low valuations rather than high growth premiums.

Yartseva found EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA were significant in some model specifications but lost significance in her more robust models, suggesting they matter but aren't as reliable as FCF/P.

**Profitability Threshold**

Profitability metrics appeared in all three studies but with different focuses:

* Mayer: Preferred 20%+ ROE.
* Eyesan: Focused on return on capital (ROC) and required it to be above industry average.
* Yartseva: Found just 9% median ROE but noted it was growing. Her winners started with modest profitability - gross margins averaged 34.8%, EBIT margins just 3.9%, ROC 6.5%.

Overall, profitability seemed to matter but nothing spectacular to start. Based on these studies, companies should ideally be profitable when you pick them, but you don't need amazing numbers - even 9% ROE may work if it's improving.

**Other Profitability Metrics**

Beyond ROE, several metrics are worth mentioning:

* Return on assets (ROA): Yartseva found coefficients of 0.4 to 1.9, meaning for every 1% increase in ROA, stock returns increased by 0.4% to 1.9% (which is small).
* Return on capital (ROC): Mayer called it critical, Eyesan required above-industry average, and Yartseva found 6.5% median in her winners.
* Operating (EBIT) margins: 82% of Eyesan's winners were profitable at the start, with median EBIT margin of 12%. Among profitable companies, those with >10% margins grew from 48% in 2012 to 85% by 2021; those with >20% margins grew from 17% to 47%.
* EBITDA margins: 30-60% for winners (Eyesan), confirmed significant by Yartseva whose models showed EBITDA margin as a statistically significant predictor with positive coefficients in her initial models.

Notably, according to Eyesan, 74% of winners grew earnings faster than revenue. This means companies were becoming more profitable over time, not just growing sales.

**Multiple Expansion**

Multiple expansion means the market paying more for each dollar of earnings over time (e.g., P/E going from 10x to 20x):

* Mayer: Described ""twin engines"" of earnings growth plus multiple expansion, showing examples of P/E expanding from 3.5x to 26x, which when combined with earnings growth created 100x returns.
* Eyesan: Found 91% of winners had EV/Revenue expansion and 72% had EV/EBITDA expansion.
* Yartseva: While Yartseva didn't isolate multiple expansion as a single variable, her findings strongly suggest valuation changes rather than earnings growth drive multibagger returns.

**Reinvestments**

All studies emphasized reinvestment capability, but with nuance:

* Mayer: Emphasized reinvestment as the most important factor - specifically companies that can reinvest profits at 20%+ returns consistently.
* Eyesan: Discussed how successful M&A strategies and aggressive expansion drove returns for many outperformers.
* Yartseva: Found that if a company's asset growth exceeds its EBITDA growth, returns drop 4-11%. This means companies must invest aggressively BUT only if their earnings are growing fast enough to support that investment.

**Ownership**

Mayer found 7% annual outperformance among owner-operators and quoted Martin Sosnoff's rule that management should own at least 10-20% of the company.

Yartseva noted owner-operators in her sample had significant vested interests (though she didn't test ownership as a specific variable).

Eyesan noted that 67% of outperformers had insider ownership above 5% (vs. 49% in the broader market), but didn't treat this as a defining factor. Instead, he emphasized qualitative signs of management-shareholder alignment like maintaining focus through acquisitions, proper capital allocation, and consistent execution of core strategy.

**Entry Timing**

For timing, buy beaten-down stocks:

* Yartseva: Stock should be near 12-month low at time of purchase.
* Mayer: Highlighted beaten-down, forgotten stocks returning to profitability as prime 100-bagger candidates.
* Eyesan: Found turnarounds deliver strong returns when problems are solvable (like fixing marketing inefficiencies or distribution issues, rather than fundamental product failures).

Yartseva also tested price momentum over various periods and found one-month momentum slightly positive, meaning stocks that rose last month tend to continue rising.

However, 3-6 month momentum was negative - stocks that performed well over the previous quarter or half-year tend to reverse, suggesting multibaggers are volatile and don't follow smooth upward trends.

**Macro Environment**

Interest rates matter. Yartseva quantified that rising Fed rates knock 8-12% off multibagger returns the following year.

This makes sense because multibaggers tend to be smaller companies that likely rely more on external financing and whose future cash flows are worth less when discount rates rise.

**Geographic Shift**

Lastly, Eyesan's data showed that 59% of recent 10-baggers came from Asia:

* India: 91 companies.
* USA: 60 companies.
* Japan: 49 companies.
* China: 34 companies.

This suggests that if you're only looking at US stocks, you're missing a lot of opportunity.

Moreover, this is striking given Asia represents only 10% of global mutual fund portfolios, suggesting massive underallocation to the region.

Eyesan also noted important regional differences in how earnings translate to returns. Markets like India, Japan, and the Nordics show good earnings-to-returns conversion efficiency, while markets like China and Latin America often see earnings growth that doesn't translate well to stock returns.

Elon has alienated his largest base of buyers in both the U.S. and Europe. Meanwhile abroad Chinese car companies crushing it, driving down margins.

The stock will eventually correct, and when it does, Elon will likely push the narrative that Tesla is a robotics company, not an auto company, similar to the Q2 earnings call when he stated they’re all-in on autonomy and not focused on an affordable Model 2.

While Tesla continues to be all-in on autonomy, his technology is fundamentally flawed, and its safety record may never match Waymo’s. If you were sending your kids off to school, would you prefer they rode in a Tesla with just cameras or a Waymo equipped with a suite of sensors fused together including: cameras, ultrasonics, radar and lidar. Do you value a 360° view and a sensor suite with multiple redundancies for your loved ones, or a Tesla with just a few cameras with blind spots?

This is why Waymo will likely win the robotaxi war, and don’t tell me they can’t scale or that it costs too much, costs will come down as they always do. Also the cost per vehicle is a moot point when amortized over thousands and thousands of rides for the life of a vehicle running 24/7.

With Tesla losing its largest base of buyers in the U.S. and Europe due to politics, Waymo poised to dominate robotaxi market, Chinese competitors squeezing Tesla abroad, and EV tax credit likey going away, expect a big correction!

1m8yfuz,2025-07-25,2025-07-25 08:56:27,How did Wall Street forget everything it learned from 2008,"Why is no one talking about the misrepresentation of Carvana?

This company is still being valued like a high growth tech darling, when in reality, it is little more than a subprime auto loan originator cloaked in aggressive, misleading accounting practices.

Today, Oppenheimer, a firm that once stood for integrity in research, raised its price target on Carvana, projecting a 40 percent upside. In doing so, they have effectively trampled on the legacy of their own past.

What happened to the spirit of Steven Eisman and Vincent Daniels, who once sat in that very research department and dared to challenge consensus, who believed in asking uncomfortable questions, who fought to arm the little guy with the truth, even when it cost them access or popularity?

Now we see the opposite. A cheerleading upgrade, disconnected from risk, seemingly blind to the lawsuits, the related party transactions, the EBITDA mirage.

This is not just about Carvana. It is about what Wall Street research has become, narrative first, truth last. It is about the abandonment of the very principles that were forged in the aftermath of Enron, WorldCom, and the financial crisis.

**Worse still, we have lost all sense of valuation itself.**  
In the pursuit of momentum and quick trades, we no longer ask what a business is truly worth, only what it *might* trade at next week. Fundamentals are pushed aside in favor of sentiment.

1jfesog,2025-03-19,2025-03-19 22:30:23,To those of you defending Google here,"What’s Google search worth?

Specifically, as someone who worked at Google, here’s my take: 

Google Search will definitely have less market share in the future than it does today. GenAI makes it too easy for tens of companies — Meta, OpenAI, Microsoft, Apple, Anthropic, Perplexity, etc. etc. — to provide search for a meaningful fraction of query use cases. The trillion dollar question is whether the pie will grow so fast that Google’s profits will stay steady or grow.

Meanwhile, the government is threatening two sources of distribution: the Apple deal and Chrome. 

Outside of this, Google feels healthy to downright exciting. YouTube is increasing in relevance as a Netflix + TikTok combo. Google Cloud is on a tear. Waymo could 10x from here.

1mqgevj,2025-08-14,2025-08-14 19:07:30,Warren Buffett’s $5 Billion Secret: The Hype and the Reveal,"
Whenever Warren Buffett makes a move, people notice. Especially when he does something quietly. This year, Berkshire Hathaway built up a nearly $5 billion stake in “commercial, industrial and other” companies. The details? Hidden away in SEC filings for the first half of 2025. The goal was simple: keep things under wraps so the stock prices wouldn’t spike while Berkshire was still buying. Buffett’s done this before—think back to when he quietly bought Chubb.

Naturally, Wall Street lost its mind. Analysts debated. CNBC and Barron’s ran stories. Everyone wanted to know: What was Buffett buying? The guesses flew:

- Caterpillar (big in construction)
- UPS (shipping and logistics)
- Honeywell, 3M, Emerson Electric
- Railroads like Union Pacific and Canadian National

Some folks even tossed UnitedHealth Group into the mix, though that didn’t really fit the “industrial” hint. I remember scrolling through Reddit threads where people were convinced it had to be a major railroad or a manufacturing giant.

As the August 14 deadline for Berkshire’s quarterly 13F filing neared, the tension built. Investors watched for any hint. Would it be another classic Buffett surprise?

Then the reveal. Berkshire’s new buys weren’t just one company. Instead, Buffett spread nearly $5 billion across three names: Lennar and D.R. Horton—both top homebuilders—and Nucor, a big steel producer. It was a bet on housing and manufacturing, right as the economy looks to be bouncing back.

A few other notable moves showed up in the filing:
- New or bigger stakes in UnitedHealth Group and Chevron
- Big sales: Apple (down 20 million shares) and Bank of America

What’s it all mean? Buffett is shifting money away from pricey tech stocks and into old-school industries with long-term potential. He’s playing the long game, as usual.

The short-term result? Stock prices jumped and investors rushed to follow his lead. But with Buffett, it’s never about the next quarter. It’s about the next decade. That’s why, even after all these years, people still call him the ""Oracle of Omaha."" And why Wall Street still hangs on every move he makes.",242,62,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1mqgevj/warren_buffetts_5_billion_secret_the_hype_and_the/,year,Value Article,0.91

1iqw5q7,2025-02-16,2025-02-16 11:37:29,A market is expensive but we are not in bubble territory yet,"Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of posts claiming that we're at the beginning of an imminent market crash. Almost inevitably, they bring up the Shiller P/E ratio, pointing out how it has preceded every major crash in history. They then argue, another crash is definitely coming. I disagree and oftentimes think these kind of metrics are shortsighted. We only have 100 years of stock market history and this is actually extremely small for sampling size. I think it's a mistake to oversubscribed too much meaning to anyone metric.  The yield curve inverting for example is supposed to be another strong sign of a market crash.  And yet here we are 6 years since it first fully inverted (2019) waiting for the market crash... 

To actually understand this, I think it helps to go back to the last major market crash: 2008.

What typically leads to major recessions? People doing exceptionally stupid stuff. And when I say exceptionally stupid, I mean *exceptionally stupid*.


2008 didn’t happen because of completely degenerate stock market valuations. In fact, the stock market itself was acting relatively rationally. The real estate market, on the other hand, was completely and totally irrational.

This is best illustrated by looking at the kinds of mortgages people were able to get at the time:


Stated Income Loans (Liar Loans) – You could literally write down whatever income you wanted, and the bank would accept it without proof. For example, if you made $30,000 per year but needed to show $60,000 to qualify for a house, you could just say you made $60,000, and loan approved lmao.  No checking income, assets, etc.  Just insane.

(Pick-a-Payment) Mortgages – These loans let borrowers choose how much to pay each month, even if it didn’t cover the actual interest. If your real mortgage payment should’ve been $1,000 per month, you could opt to pay $200, and the unpaid balance would just get added to the loan. Over time, borrowers racked up huge debt, making the entire system a ticking time bomb.
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The level of stupidity happening at the time was insane, and everyone was doing it. So it’s not hard to see how the 2000s led to a massive subprime mortgage bubble.

I also don’t think it’s a coincidence that this happened almost a century after the Great Depression. By then, everyone who had actually lived through the Depression was either dead or long retired, and the painful lessons from that era had been forgotten. This led to deregulation changes, which, in turn, led to people doing extremely stupid things all over again. My guess is we won't see a collapse in the magnitude of 2008 again soon.  I believe it is much more likely in the latter half of this century when folks inevitably start to deregulate stuff that should stay regulated as they forget the mistakes the past.


In general for a genuine market bubble and crash, you need a strong catalyst of stupidity that builds up over time.  Which brings me to where people today are pointing fingers: AI.

Is AI a Bubble? Let's look at the Mag 7 and Palantir

Nvidia – Trading at 50x earnings, but growing at 100% year over year with forward P/E below 40. Could Nvidia take a large haircut? Sure. But does that mean its valuation is unwarranted? No—they’re delivering exceptional results.
Palantir – Stupid.  - The whole market was like Palantir in the late 1990s.  We need Palantirs everywhere before we enter bubble territory of that same magnitude.
Tesla – Similar to Palantir, just stupid multiples IMO.

Rest of the ""Magnificent 7"" – Actually not trading at insane valuations. Expensive? Yes. Degenerate? No. For context, Coca-Cola (KO) was trading at 90x earnings with zero growth before the dot-com bubble. If these companies were trading at twice their current multiples, then I’d be concerned. But expensive is still a long way from bubble territory.


What’s Most Likely to Happen From Here?
Here are a few possible scenarios:

The market takes a 20-30% haircut – A correction, not a crash.

The market stagnates for a few years – No strong compounding returns.
AI hype actually turns into a real bubble – If valuations double from here without matching earnings, we might be in genuine bubble territory. Right now, we’re not seeing 1999-level multiples.

A major market crash does happen but not because of an ""AI bubble.""
If there’s going to be a real crash, I’d argue it’s not going to come from AI. Instead, it’ll come from something incredibly stupid happening in a part of the market that no one is paying attention to—just like 2008.

And if I had to guess where that might be? China.

China is not transparent about what’s really happening in their economy, and we’ve all seen headlines about their recent struggles. As economies become more globalized, a major downturn in China could affect the world potentially.  

 the last thing I want to point out about this as I've been seeing these kind of posts for almost ten years now.  I can remember seeing them starting regularly back in 2017 and people talking about how they're keeping cash on the sideline waiting for the inevitable crash.

1m9z4kr,2025-07-26,2025-07-26 13:28:39,How To Profit From Trump's 'Golden Dome',"**TLDR:** Trump has announced a new £140bn+ 'Golden Dome' missile defence plan, which is essentially 'Star Wars 2.0'. This massive government spending programme is set to create a gold rush for defence contractors. I've done a deep dive on which companies stand to benefit the most.

Lockheed Martin (LMT): The obvious giant, making most of the existing systems the Dome will be built on. However, they just posted a disastrous earnings report (a 78% EPS miss!) and look like they might be fumbling. Is it a value trap? I have a recent article explaining in full why I don't like this one much.

Northrop Grumman (NOC): The momentum play. This company is executing flawlessly, crushing its earnings, and has already won the contracts for the next-gen B-21 bomber and Sentinel ICBMs. Crucially, their CEO just confirmed they are *already testing* the advanced space-based interceptors for the Dome.

RTX Corp (RTX): The safe ""picks and shovels"" play. They are the indispensable supplier of the advanced radars and proven interceptors that everyone, including the prime contractors, will need to buy. In my opinion has less upside than NOC and VSAT - although is probably a safer pick.

Viasat (VSAT): The hidden gem. A higher-risk, but potentially high-reward, bet. They specialise in the secure satellite communications network needed to link the entire ""system of systems"" together and recently won a key prototyping contract with the Pentagon's innovation unit.

Conclusion: My analysis points to Northrop Grumman (NOC) as the most compelling investment right now. They are firing on all cylinders and are perfectly positioned to win the most advanced and lucrative contracts. For those with a higher risk appetite, Viasat (VSAT) is an interesting speculative punt, but at this point I wouldn't take a large position.

1nvuluv,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 00:49:36,AMZN is cheaper than you think,"So I'm sure many people are looking at AMZN's P/E ratio of 33.7x and thinking that while it's more reasonable than it used to be, it's still pretty expensive. Especially when you can pickup shares of GOOGL or META at 26x. But I think a useful valuation metric to look at is the price to operating cash flow and I'll explain why.

Net income is an accounting metric that includes depreciation and amortization, and it's up to the business to decide the schedule for those, meaning they can decide, for example, that the useful life of a GPU is 6 years when in reality it's probably 2 years. Another problem is that GAAP requires companies to mark to market any investments each quarter, meaning that if a company holds shares of a different company, the change in price effects net income.

This is why investors run discounted cash flow models, because ultimately cash is what matters--not accounting results. The value of a business is the present value of the future cash you can extract from the business over its life. The problem with using free cash flow is that capex is part of the equation, and capex is highly variable year to year. Some years you may buy a new office building and a new warehouse and a bunch of warehouse equipment, and other years you might not buy anything.

Operating cash flow removes capex from the equation which allows you to simply focus on how much cash the business actually produces from its operations. Not paper gains of a stock they hold, or because they chose to extend the useful life of their assets. Just the operations.

So on a price to trailing twelve month P/OCF ratio, here are the results for the Magnificent 7 stocks:

* TSLA: 91.3x
* NVDA: 59.0x
* AAPL: 34.9x
* MSFT: 28.3x
* GOOGL: 22.1x
* AMZN: 19.4x
* META: 17.6x

Now you might think this is stupid because free cash flows are what matter. Who cares if your operating cash flow is great but you need to spend it all on capex to continue generating the cash flow? While this is true, I think it's useful to compare just the operating businesses as capex is highly variable and is a choice that doesn't need to be made in perpetuity. Now of course, AMZN is by far the most structurally capital intensive (besides TSLA? maybe?) since they actually move real stuff in the real world so that needs to be taken into consideration. 

Anyway, just thought I'd share. I think understanding the price you're paying relative to the cash generated by operations is useful and should be considered when evaluating a business' valuation.

1kwx3fz,2025-05-27,2025-05-27 15:57:14,Berkshire Hathaway stock: possibly the only US large cap stock exposure you need,"Although I regard the US stock market as overvalued and greatly prefer international stocks, I own and strongly recommend Berkshire Hathaway stock.  While I have at times wished that it were more volatile, Warren Buffett does not want certain shareholders to get the short end of the stick just because they bought or sold stock at the wrong time.

Given the track record and unique company culture at Berkshire Hathaway, I have FAR more trust in this company and its management than I have in any other.  Even though Charlie Munger is now at the Annual Meeting In The Sky and Warren Buffett recently announced his retirement, Berkshire Hathaway will continue to be in great hands for years to come.  This is the team that knows insurance and banking better than anyone else and that is NOT beholden to Wall Street's unpredictable mercenary armies of day traders and AI traders.  In addition to the very best large cap US stocks, Berkshire Hathaway owns companies that are no longer or that have never been publicly traded, such as See's Candies, Nebraska Furniture Mart, and GEICO.

In my opinion, Berkshire Hathaway sets the standard in financial assets.  You shouldn't take on the risk of any other equity UNLESS you can explain why it has a substantial chance of outperforming Berkshire Hathaway in the years ahead.  This is exceptionally difficult within the universe of large cap US stocks, because Berkshire Hathaway already owns the best ones.",224,97,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1kwx3fz/berkshire_hathaway_stock_possibly_the_only_us/,year,Discussion,0.92
1h68802,2024-12-03,2024-12-03 23:57:21,For those that think the market is overvalued based on historical norms...,"There have been some huge structural changes in our society that make simply comparing basic indicators like historical P/E ratios insufficient in determining whether the market is overvalued or not, the biggest being:

1. We've had over a decade of the fed injecting unprecedented amount of liquidity into the financial system - its not a coincidence that we've seen the biggest bull run in our lifetimes beginning after the 2008 financial crisis, because that's precisely when this started happening with QE. Then this got turbocharged again during the 2020 pandemic. Look at this graph of M2 money supply: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL) \- **investable money has nearly 3x since the start of QE**. All that money has to go somewhere, which is why we see the current ""everything"" bubble with stocks and RE all at all time highs. 

2. Wealth inequality in our economy has accelerated over the past few decades with the middle class being increasingly hollowed out and companies placing shareholders interests first and employees interests last. The [top 10% of earners own 93% of the stock market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wealthiest-10-americans-own-93-033623827.html), these folks don't need the money they invest to fund their day to day lives and are just looking for the best return on their money. 

This is basic supply and demand problem --> there's been a huge increase in demand for investments with the increased money supply (M2 graph shown above) but the supply of investment opportunities have not kept pace and could argue even decreased: 

\- limited increase in housing supply even as total populations grow and economic opportunities get increasingly  concentrated in a small number of metro areas

\- a digital economy that makes it easier than ever for huge companies to dominate and further entrench their dominance by unlocking economies of scale, leading to fewer total winners - why invest in 5 different specialty retailers when amazon sells everything for cheaper and delivers to you faster?

  
The market may very well be overvalued - who knows - but coming to that judgement purely by looking at historical norms is comparing apples to oranges. The fact is that a smaller number of people hold the vast majority of the investable wealth in the US and all that money is looking to make a return somewhere - so with real estate also at all time highs and in many ways even more overvalued than the stock market when comparing the cost to buy vs rent, combined with interest rates coming down, *where else is all that money going to go?*

1mm98kb,2025-08-10,2025-08-10 00:22:20,Paypal is strangely cheaper at $67 now than it was at $60 in 2023,"**TLDR:** because of the reduction in shares (-13% since 2023) through buybacks and lower stock based comp, Paypal's market cap is lower now at $67 ($64.61 billion market cap), vs at $60 in 2023 ($65.88 billion market cap). 

The calculation is as follows (all share counts are from the 2023 and 2025 10-Q's):

**2023:** 1.098 billion shares x $60 share price = $65.88 billion market cap, *vs*

**Now:** 955 million shares x $67.66 share price = $64.61 billion market cap

What this effectively means for shareholders is that, for every $ you spend on Paypal shares right now, you are getting a slightly higher proportion of ownership of the company compared to every $ you spent on shares in 2023 at the previous $60 share price. 

Put another way, if you were to buy the entire company of Paypal, you would only need to pay $64.61 billion (bargain, right?), rather than $65.88 billion, ***despite the fact that the share price is higher now.*** 

This not only benefits shareholders, it also makes the buybacks themselves cheaper, leading to a sort of 'snowball effect' where a reduction in shares means Paypal can buyback a larger proportion of the company for the same cost. 

There's literally a perfect example below where they purchased the same number of shares for the same cost, but with totally different yields:

In the six months ended **June 2023:** Paypal bought back 41 million shares of common stock (out of 1.098 billion) for approximately $3.0 billion at an average price of $72.42, ***for a yield of 3.7%.*** 

In the six months ended **June 2025:** Paypal bought back approximately 41 million shares of common stock (out of 955 million) for approximately $3.0 billion at an average cost of $72.45, ***for a yield of 4.3%.***

If this were to continue into 2026, the **yield would be 4.5%** and this would go on and on. And this assumes they don't increase the cash used for their buyback program, which they have been doing. They've also reduced the share count by reducing their stock based compensation (SBC):

In 2022, they gave $768 million SBC (these are all six months ended to June 30).

In 2023, they gave $733 million. 

In 2024, they gave $692 million. 

In 2025, they gave $573 million. 

Will be interesting to see whether this strategy continues and what the outcome is.

1jh1g1z,2025-03-22,2025-03-22 01:29:10,BLBD looks like a screaming value buy,"
Hello everyone,

I’ve been eyeing Blue Bird (BLBD) at $33. It’s a school bus maker I’ve spotted everywhere. Looks like a simple, growing, under-the-radar business. Buy or skip? Here’s the scoop:

- Simple Business: Makes school buses (diesel and electric). No tech jargon. Just transports kids. I get it in one sentence.

- Growth: 2024 revenue $1.35B (up 19%), EPS $3.23 (up 112% so doubled!), 7,500-unit backlog. 2025 guidance: $1.45-$1.55B, 20%+ EPS growth ($4+). Fast-grower vibes.

- Valuation: P/E 14 (trailing), 11-12 (forward $4 EPS), PEG 0.6 (very cheap) vs. 20% growth. S&P’s at 25.

- Financial Health: $129M cash, $94M net debt (0.7x EBITDA), $131M free cash flow. Lean, funds expansion. No red flags.

- Moat: ~50% U.S. bus share, so schools trust them for decades. Diesel’s steady; EVs (700+ sold) add edge.

- Customer Base: Schools nationwide. Must hav not discretionary. ~25,000-33,000 buses replaced yearly, so rock-solid demand.

- Catalysts: EV shift (1,000 backlog), capacity up (12,000 to 14,000+ units), growing margins (19.1% vs. 12.2% in 2023). Multi-year runway.

- Market Perception: $1.5B cap, sparse coverage with Wall Street’s asleep.

- Insider Buying No big moves in 2024 filings—neutral. Management’s steady, not dumping. They announced a large share buyback program in February of this year. 

- Inventory/Backlog: 7,500 firm orders ($675M+)—6+ months locked. No pile-up, just demand.

- Risks: Competition (Lion Electric, IC Bus) could bite; EV scaling’s tricky, supply snags possible. Growth’s not bulletproof.

- Upside: EPS $8 by 2028 (backlog + EVs), P/E 20 = $160, so 3x-5x bagger shot. Even $6 EPS, P/E 15 = $90, so almost triple the current price.

Feels like a great buy since it’s so simple, growing, cheap, with a moat and upside. Risks exist, but buses aren’t going away. Anyone holding? Buy at $33, or am I overhyping? Value nerds hit me with your takes!

1ho4py3,2024-12-28,2024-12-28 07:28:28,I'm picking up Hershey stock at 3 year lows,"This is the type of company I think of when I hear Buffet talking about ""Great American Companies"". They've been around since 1894, 130 year old company. I think these conditions are a good time to open up a lifelong hold for such a long-standing and consistent company.

The only bad news with Hershey right now is the spike in Cocoa prices. I view this is a short term dilemma that is causing an overreaction on the share price, in fact I view this bearish catalyst as more of a buying opportunity rather than an actual setback. It's already down 37% from its all-time high in 2023 and down 20% from its 2022 support levels. The price drop from those levels was certainly justified but now that it has already happened I think it's at a good value, any more downside is just a buying opportunity in my opinion

It is currently trading at 3 year lows despite a consistent growth rate in their profit, revenue, and cash flow over the past decade (more than a decade really but I'm just using past decade for this analysis). Not growing EVERY year, but already massive. Slow and steady is good for a 130 year old company. Not a stock that I expect to shoot up like crazy any time soon, like I said maybe even some bearishness with the Cocoa prices but may as well get locked in at low prices. Currently has a 3.19% dividend yield so I don't mind holding and waiting.

P/E ratio is currently 19, down from its 10 year median of 25.

Free cash flow increasing roughly 17% per year over the past decade.

Median net profit margin of 14.76% the past decade

Debt:Equity ratio at around 1.6 compared to their 10-year median of 2.56.. 

May as well mention the 3.19% dividend yield again

I got in around $171 per share and would not mind adding more if it dips.

There was recent discussion of Hershey possibly being bought by Mondelez. Hershey Trust Company voted against this decision because the offer was too low, and this is actually the second time they voted against a Mondelez buyout (last time was 2016). I like this because it shows that Hershey's Trust understands what it is; one of the greatest American companies of all time and they're not gonna sell themselves unless the offer is top tier.

Their moat is extraordinary not only for their name recognition but also the fact that they own many of the most popular brands such as Reese's, Kit Kat, Jolly Rancher, Twizzler, Ice Breaker, Milk Duds, Sour Strips, to name a few. 

I wanna say more about their Trust Company;

* **Milton Hershey School Trust**: The largest trust, with $17.4 billion in assets as of 2021. This trust funds the Milton Hershey School, a private boarding school for children from low-income families.

Their largest trust goes towards educating low-income families free of tuition. That's noble. Hershey Trust members do not want to sell their legacy to another company over mediocre offers. Granted I don't know what happens to the school trust if bought by Mondelez but still, I just like the integrity of knowing their worth and rejecting what's not good enough for them.

* **M.S. Hershey Foundation Trust**: A trust that supports educational institutions in Derry Township, Pennsylvania. 
* **Hershey Cemetery Perpetual Care Maintenance Trust**: A trust that manages the Hershey Cemetery.

If I'm planning on a lifelong investment in a company I want them doing some good for the world. Not like these healthcare companies who profit off of denying meds to children with terminal illness. I know these types of pursuits aren't the greatest for pure profit but I like being proud of the companies I'm invested in. 

Even if you don't care about a company's ethics, the numbers look nice to me (in terms of long-term value over short-term growth). And the fact that they can sustain these trusts on top of a healthy dividend yield for so long says a lot about their consistency.

1mrxars,2025-08-16,2025-08-16 10:46:00,Wendy's got hammered. Nothing seriously wrong that I can see.,"I really like it when I find a company with a basic, reliable business with a cratering valuation. $WEN has traded at 12-13x cash flow since 2013 (as far back as I looked). There is nothing magical about Wendy's but it is solidly profitable and generates good cash flow. It was highlighted in Barron's today as an underperformer in the fast food sector. It is down almost 50% this year.

What happened? Management doubled to dividend in 2023. Then slashed it back slightly above 2022's level. Revenues have been declining recently, mostly from slowing sales at US locations. 20% of stores are international franchises and that is where the growth is coming from.

Revenue declines are not good, obviously, but all of these fast food chains go through slow periods from time to time. It is always fixed with menu changes, promotions, something.

What I think happened is that management got a bit lazy, buying back a lot of stock over the last decade ( from over 400mm shares in 2009 to under 200 million now), to keep squeezing EPS higher. Probably took their eye off the ball. The doubling of the dividend in 2023 was an odd decision but that's over now. The new dividend is still an increase from 2022.

This is not a great business, but it revenue growth can be re-booted and the valuation will go back at least to 8-9x cash flow when that happens. Combine those two, and this is a double in 4-5 years with almost no downside risk.

1mcjwt8,2025-07-29,2025-07-29 14:48:31,UNH is not value investing--yet--and you guys need to understand how to calculate value.,"I’m seeing a lot of posts hyping up UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as a “buy the dip” opportunity just because the stock has fallen from around $600 to the high $200s. People are calling this the bottom and claiming it’s a great value play—without actually doing the math or understanding the context.

Let’s be clear: UNH didn’t release a 10-Q this quarter, but they did file an 8-K, which contains important details investors seem to be ignoring:  
🔗 [UNH Q2 2025 Form 8-K](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/content/dam/UHG/PDF/investors/2025/unh-q2-2025-form-8k.pdf)

\- UnitedHealthcare (UHC): -48.2%

\- Optum Health: -59.4%

\- OptumRx: +2.5%

\-Optum Insight: +359%

At first glance, some might cheer about that massive increase in Optum Insight. But here's the catch: UNH’s real profit engine is denying care through AI-powered prior authorization tools—that’s what Optum Insight specializes in. They’re literally selling AI denial systems to other healthcare companies and insurers, and business is booming—for now. If you want to see what they're selling, take a look:

But here’s the real risk: CMS is tightening its audit policies, and the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) is threatening the business model that makes this kind of aggressive cost-cutting viable. If enforcement ramps up, both UNH and the clients of Optum Insight could face serious regulatory and legal headwinds. oh wait!... they are ramping up.

1i9nm6c,2025-01-25,2025-01-25 09:05:15,The Very Last: Occidental Petroleum Investment Thesis,"Dear Redditors,

In this letter, I will explain why Warren Buffett invested in Occidental Petroleum and why I am too.

Let me start with how Warren Buffett has basically bought himself a risk-free bond yielding 10% with future growth potential that have very very long runways. And yes, oil prices matter... sort of…

**What happens when oil prices are high?**

Well, back in Q1 2023, OXY redeemed 6.47% of Berkshire Hathaway’s preferred shares after a record 2022 where worldwide oil prices averaged at $91.91 in Q1, $100.10 in Q2, $98.30 in Q3, and $94.36 in Q4 of 2022 (based on OXY's Q1 2023 10-Q).

The redemption was mandatory, due to a provision in the preferred stock where if (in the trailing 12 months) OXY spends more than $4.00 per share in either:(i) dividends paid to common shareholders and (ii) repurchases of the common stock, then the amount above $4.00 per share must be redeemed at a 10% premium.

At the time, the long-term federal funds rate (FFR) was reaching 5%. Given OXY’s credit ratings Baa3 by Moody’s and BB+ by S&P and Fitch, the interest on OXY’s debt would’ve been \~6% to 7%. Interest payments have tax benefits. Preferred shares do not. This is why Warren Buffett said ""this makes sense"" during his annual shareholder meeting.

So in the high oil prices scenario, depending on the FFR rate, preferred decreases, debt decreases, buybacks increase, earnings increase, and the stock price increases (perhaps some multiple expansion too, depending on how Mr. Market feels).

**What happens when oil prices are low?**

This is where things get interesting as Warren Buffett has found downside protection.

(1) OXY is one of the most efficient oil producers claiming production costs that break even at $40 worldwide oil price which puts a nice margin of safety on earnings. 

(2) The preferred shares are immortal. With lower capital amounts returned to shareholders, preferreds are unlikely to get redeemed. Even if we get Paul Volckered at some point, the tax benefit strategy redeeming preferreds over debt no longer works. 

(3) Low oil prices bring down the oil production of the United States and OXY contributes to about \~1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). That's a noticible amount if it were to going missing, compared to smaller players. Overall, the US is in a very strong position to affect oil prices (geopolitics in part) and I highly doubt they US wants to cede energy price control back to OPEC. Moreover, the United State's lead in oil production is mutually beneficial as OPEC countries seek to diversify from oil driven economies. Oh, and the Saudi's tried to kill US shale, but failed. Turns out, at the end of the day, economies need their fiscal budgets to balance... except for the US who controls the dollar.

(4) US oil majors (perhaps all oil majors) are no longer interested in the boom and bust cycle that wreaks havoc on supply chains and drives inflation. Price stability is in the world’s best interest. Crashing oil prices, I would say, is unlikely -- despite Donald Trump's economic illiteracy. That said, a tighter mid-cycle range of oil prices is in everyone's best interest.

(5) Not to offend some Warren Buffet cultists, but it appears he is also decreasing the float of the company to add some stock price stability which could indirectly protect credit ratings from volatile price action and bipolar bull/bear sentiment on oil. Remember, he described OXY’s volume as a gambling parlor and being able to buy his entire stake in 2 weeks and decreasing the amount of lendable shares (up to 50%) could help price stability. Warren Buffett also owns some warrants too, so it’s a win-win for both.

**What does that leave for the rest of us?**

Assuming oil prices stay in the current $70 to $90 range, OXY’s earnings are relatively predictable.

Now, excuse me for using EPS. I know it's a sin, but for simplicity, just listen to me.

Some quarters will come in low range (maybe $0.50) while other quarters come in the high range ($1.50). Depending how Mr. Market feels about oil (bullish or bearish due to geopolitics, renewables, etc), OXY’s price may swing +/- 30%. But in the long-term, the earnings will average out, debt will decrease, preferred shares will  be redeemed, dividends increased, buybacks increased, and OXY will be an opportunistic consolidator (this is where Warren Buffett’s trust in Vicki’s capital allocation is crucial).

So it's clear Warren Buffet is making out like a bandit, so why are other super investors such as Li Lu buying a stake in the company?

Believe it or not, I believe these super investors are ***speculating*** on OXY’s competitive advantage in carbon management, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech -- after all “safe investments make for safe speculation.”

Crazy, I know, but before you stop reading, hear me out.

OXY is basically a high yielding bond with two growth driver’s that have very *very* long runways: 

1. Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)
2. Carbon Management via Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Sequestration

I’ll start with the less controversial one…

**TerraLithium: Direct Lithium Extraction**

If you didn’t know TerraLithium is a 50-50 joint venture between a start-up, All American Lithium, and a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. All American Lithium was the latest iteration of a company that originally formed to [acquire the assets](https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2017/02/10/salton-sea-geothermal-plant-would-use-lithium-tech-caught-teslas-eye/97743092/) of Simbol Materials, which developed a much-hyped and highly secretive lithium extraction process. Simbol Materials’ technology impressed **ELON MUSK** (yes, you read that correctly) so much that Tesla offered to buy the start-up for $325 million. But the deal fell apart as Simbol Materials’ commanded a billion dollar valuation (**Jefferies valued them at $2.5 Billion**). Tesla investors familiar with the matter, know that they did not have a billion dollars to throw around at the time. And months later Simbol Materials went bust.

Fast forward to today:

**Berkshire Hathaway Energy owns 10 out of the 11 geothermal power plants in the Salton Sea and TerraLithium has over 40 patents relating to direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine. Together, they are working to tap the estimated 18 million metric tons of lithium suspended in geothermal brine. That's the equivalent to half of the current global production of lithium. It's enough to make over 375 million electric vehicle batteries. The depth of the Salton Sea's reserves dwarf other potential reserves such as the  Smackover Formation or hectorite clay, recovered oil field brines, recycled electronics, etc.**

The 11th geothermal power plant is owned by a competitor EnergySource Minerals who is also trying to extract lithium from geothermal brine. Despite being closer to a commercially viable solution, EnergySource Minerals attempted to challenge TerraLithium's patent for being ""too general"" which may suggest that TerraLithium's patent claims are competitively advantaged (on top of the scale advantage provided by Berkshire Hathaway Energy). The other competitor called Controlled Thermal Resources must start from scratch (the project being dubbed  “Hell’s Kitchen”). That is, build a geothermal power plant and then add the direct lithium extraction tech which, compared to Berkshire Hathaway Energy and TerraLithium, has high execution risk. Berkshire Hathaway Energy has been running their geothermal plants for decades and Occidental Petroleum has decades of experience with carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech. Let's just say, in a weird twist, the potential Tesla backed Simbol Materials is now backed by Occidental Petroleum and Berkshire Hathaway Energy via a subsidiary called TerraLithium.

Any regulatory hurdles will be minimal: (1) At the national level, there's a strong bipartisan push for lithium independence. (2) At the state level, the government plans on taxing all extracted lithium. (3) At the local community level, there's a powerful incentive to revitalize communities that were destroyed by the drying of the Salton Sea which exposed toxic lakebed dust containing pesticides and heavy metals. New direct lithium extraction facilities offer a chance for regional revival creating an estimated 80,000 new jobs. (4) Direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine is significantly greener than hard rock mining and solar evaporation of brine.

**If you ever wondered why Warren Buffet chose his successor to be Greg Abel (*****the current CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy*****) this is probably a major contributing factor (not the only though).**

I have no idea what TerraLithium will be worth, but in Q2 2024 Occidental Petroleum did a “small” fair value adjustment of $27 million on assets that were once valued at **$2.5 billion in 2014 by Jefferies** \-- with a stronger team now, than 10 years ago. Eventually, they plan on licensing this tech, and let's just say, owning the patents to the tech that can extract half the current global production is probably worth something. And of course lithium prices matter, but the tech is a fixed cost that would be shielded from the *cyclicality* of lithium prices.

Now, onto the more controversial one…

**1PointFive: Carbon Management**

Anti-oil company climate activists can stop reading now.

On May 18^(th), 2024, at CERAWeek by S&P Global -- an annual global energy conference focusing on the industry’s biggest goals and challenges -- Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman interviewed CEO Vicki Hollub to discuss Occidental Petroleum’s CrownRock Acquisition in December 2023. 

In the latter half of the interview, Vicki Hollub details a clear path for how Occidental Petroleum will transition to a Carbon Management Company, via their subsidiary 1PointFive:

>“We've been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for over 50 years. It's a core competence of ours; we understand how CO2 works, how to manage it, and how to handle it effectively. We have the necessary infrastructure in the Permian Basin for this.  
For a long time, we attempted to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industrial sources. This proved to be challenging because negotiating with industrial sites to retrofit equipment for carbon capture was difficult. We started this effort back in 2008 but were unsuccessful in making it happen with any partners.”

Vicki is talking about Occidental Petroleum’s previously failed Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) venture called Century. Built in 2010, Century was intended to be the largest carbon capture facility in the world, aiming to handle over 20% of global CCS capacity. Integrated into a natural gas processing plant, Century was designed to capture carbon dioxide before it could be released into the atmosphere by using two engines: one capable of capturing 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and the other able to capture more than 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.

However, a **Bloomberg Green** investigation found satellite data showing that cooling towers on one of the engines didn’t function, suggesting that Century never operated at more than a third of its capacity in the 13 years it’s been running. The technology worked but the economics didn’t hold up because of limited gas supplied from a nearby field, leading to disuse and eventual divestment by Occidental Petroleum who sold off the project in 2022 for $200 million to Mitchell Group - significantly less than the original $1.1 Billion invested into Century.

The painful lesson: while CCS technology worked, the economics are heavily tied to the carbon dioxide emission source. Mainly, the profitability relied on how much carbon dioxide was emitted and negotiating/working with the owners of the emission source. 

Luckily, a new carbon capture technology emerged, direct air capture (DAC), that proved much more economically viable:

>“Then we discovered a carbon capture technology designed to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This was a game-changer for us, akin to finding the holy grail. With this technology, we no longer needed to negotiate with emitters; instead, we could control our own development pace and schedule. This direct air capture approach allows us to operate when and where it makes the most sense.”

Learning from the failed venture of Century, Vicki believes that DAC is more economically viable because the source of carbon dioxide is pulled out of the atmosphere (not carbon dioxide emission sources) which shifts the bottleneck to cost reduction of DAC technology. Freed from the complication of carbon dioxide emitters, Occidental Petroleum engineers can focus on building the most cost efficient DAC facility without rushing or technical limitations from carbon dioxide emitters that could result in suboptimal decisions.

>“An added advantage is that the technology uses potassium hydroxide to capture CO2 from the air. We are the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the U.S. and the second largest globally. Additionally, for efficient mixing in the contact tower—necessary for optimal CO2 extraction—PVC diffusers are used. We also manufacture PVC, creating synergies with our existing oil and gas and chemical businesses.  
These synergies were fortuitous, and it felt like it was meant for us. However, the economic viability of direct air capture depends on various factors, including the performance of rivals and market conditions.”

Along with Occident Petroleum’s infrastructure to use captured carbon for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery in the Permian Basin, when it comes to developing DAC, Occidental Petroleum already has part of the supply chain for DAC vertically integrated.

The main challenge that remains is the fact that DAC is a rather expensive process. According to a news post by Julie Chao from Berkeley Labs on April 20^(th), 2022, DAC costs about $600 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) with the following 2 factors driving up the cost: (1) Separating the carbon dioxide from the reactive absorbent -- usually potassium hydroxide -- requires a costly heating process. (2) Carbon dioxide’s poor solubility in water requires a costly pressurizing process to sequester the carbon dioxide in a saline reservoir to use later for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery.

Despite the US tax credit of $180 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal that is directly captured from the atmosphere, the overall economics make DAC a money losing venture with a theoretical net loss of $420 per metric ton of DAC CDR.

However, Vicki talks about a developing carbon credit market, where DAC CDR credits can be sold for a premium with increasing demand:

>“We plan to launch the first phase of Stratos, our direct air capture facility in the Permian Basin, by mid-next year. We have already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for the facility, which will ultimately handle 500,000 tons of CO2 per year. The demand is strong, coming from airlines, tech companies, consulting firms, and others interested in reducing their carbon footprint.  
These buyers are part of the voluntary compliance market, focusing on offsetting their carbon emissions. This should provide us with a steady cash flow from the facility.  
As for when the facility will break even and become profitable, it depends on the value of credits beyond those we’ve already sold. While credit prices are currently rising due to limited availability, I hope to have a clearer picture in two years. We’ll check back with you as things continue to evolve.”

At full capacity, Stratos will collect 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year costing at least $300 million in annual operational expenses. In combination with the $180 DAC CDR credits, Stratos is projected to lose $420 per metric ton of CDR which is an annualized loss of $210 million. 

However, as Vicki points out, companies are willing to pay a premium for DAC CDR credits, which may help subsidize and offset the loss. Here’s a list deals that were already made:

Climate activists' be damned, but reducing in carbon emissions doesn't quickly eliminate all the carbon in the atomosphere. To reverse climate change, carbon needs to be removed from the air.

*That is a fact.*

There are a handful of startups that remove carbon from the air, but their solutions can only remove **tens** of thousands of metric tons. To be blunt, all of their solutions are subscale and fall short of even putting a dent into reversing climate change.

However, Stratos' scale is to the tune of **hundreds** of thousands. At full capacity, Stratos can remove \~500,000 metric tons of carbon per year while running on green energy.

*Stratos' scale blows out the competition by over 10 times the capacity.*

And unlike trees, OXY *can* optimize DAC plants to be built, smaller, cheaper, and faster. If this tech improves, it would only take a few thousand of these DAC plants to reverse climate change.

*OXY, via their subsidiary 1Point5, is both well capitlized and vertically integrated to scale DAC and fight climate change.*

**History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.**

Crazy or not, I believe buying OXY now is like buying Nvidia.

Nvidia’s GPUs have proven various use cases from gaming, crypto, to AI, where the core gaming business was rather unattractive.

*Before Nvidia's enormous run, analysts valued Nvidia's GPUs potential in crypto and AI at basically 0.*

Similarly, OXY’s expertise in carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech has proven various use cases from carbon based enhanced oil recovery, lithium extraction, carbon sequestration, and carbon removal tech.

*Currently analysts value Direct Lithium Extraction tech and a transtion to Carbon Management at 0.* 

What baffles me is that Nvidia’s growth is fueled by **speculative demand** for crypto and artificial intelligence. The world has yet to see returns, but plans on spending $1 trillion over the next few years on AI hoping the economics will work out.

*If that isn’t speculation, I don’t know what is.*

And believe me, I understand this tech more than you ever would think. A colleague of mine who has a PhD in CS told me exactly the many use cases of GPUs, but I didn't buy it because: (1) I viewed AI as speculative. (2) Because of reason 1, I expected companies to invest slowly and cautiously. I mean, just look at how the market reacted to Mark Zuckerberg's push into the Metaverse. (3) Because of reason 1 and 2, I expected a slow growth rate where Nvidia's moat would erode in a 3 to 5 year time frame to competitors (something that is happening as we speak -- i.e. CUDA on AMD) before Nvidia could make a killing.

In fact, my stance on tech in general can be summarized as so:

>The reality of tech companies is that they age rapidly — like dog years squared. Moats flash in and out of existence within 2 to 3 years time (along with their valuations). The odds of finding the next Oracle are slim to none, because it's almost certain that the world will never rely on a single relational database architecture again. The main worries in tech are competition, growth, value-cre-ation, and value-ation. When competition enters the space, investors should pack their bags since the rapid democratization of information allows competition to grow at lightning speeds. Ironically, the forever holdings are businesses that are entrenched usually for non-technological reasons (i.e Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, Spotify, Palantir). And lack of technical and algorithmic literacy, makes the chances of accurately determining an enduring business at early stages next to none.

With the release of ChatGPT, you can imagine where I went wrong... At that point, I should've just bought the damn company since the growth was obviously higher than I anticipated completely invalidating my original thoughts. But I digress, the focus of this letter isn't about me confessing my sins for missing out on Nvidia...

Nvidia aside, Occidental Petroleum’s growth is fueled by **non-speculative demand**:

(1) Lithium independence is a bipartisan goal, and lithium demand is very healthy with our tech boom.

(2) Climate change keeps getting worse. Reducing emission slows it, but to reversing it requires the atmosphere to be decarbonized which is a very healthy tailwind for a growing carbon credit market that OXY can dominate.

(3) Due to oil being sytemically ingrained into the world, the clean energy transition is very slow. So I can sleep knowing that tomorrow oil will still be here.

Overall, I buy whenever OXY nears ***single*** digit earnings multiples or reaches an acceptable free cash flow yield (adjusted for things I deem reasonable like Warren's preferred shares, because there’s cash flow and then there’s cash flow I get).

For me OXY is a safe vehicle to park my money while I wait for other opportunities. And until then, I will just be clipping coupons.

So yeah, oil prices matter... sort of... but, Occidental Petroleum has some other things too...

**\[Amendment; January 27, 2025\]** Please re-read my stance on tech. In a mere 2 years AI investment, we are at a crossroads with Nvidia v.s. DeepSeek. I believe this letter speaks for itself. As for what's going to happen?  I have no fucking clue, but I do not believe natural market forces are in play.

**\[Amendment; April 9, 2025\]** In an ironic turn of events, an orange man is shilling EVs and about to tank US shale. So much for ""Drill, baby drill."" Now, I have no doubt that lower oil prices equals less oil production. **But, if US shale falters, there will be massive ramifications**. There is a reason why the stock market is declining rapidly. There is an old man fondling economic nukes, putting the world on the brink of economic instability we have not seen since the pandemic. The fear is real, and opportunity is already appearing. Perhaps there's a reason why Berkshire was making small bets on beer, pizza, and pools... in any event, depending on how long these tarriffs persist, US shale is one of the last places you want to be...

**\[Amendment; May 14, 2025\]** As Warren Buffett said himself, this market volatility is nothing. Had you seen my revisions, I swung massive handsomely into a small oil company in the state of California and let’s just say have done quite well since during this recovery. As for where i put those gains, OXY is neither on nor off the table, but other opportunities can and will exist. oil is a commodity and volatile, but it works in both directions. but one thing won’t change and that’s how important OXY is to reducing the deficit…

**\[Amendment; June 15, 2025\]** From doom and gloom tariff induced oil price winter, to Israel has targeting Iran energy infrastructure, only time will tell where oil prices go. In the meantime, OXY is making steady progress right sizing the balance sheet and it’s carbon management initiatives.

But there was a brief window of time in which:*

*The banks knew this, but*

*The market did not.*

*In particular, the banks held lots of shares of Archegos’s seven stocks (ViacomCBS Inc., Baidu Inc., Discovery Inc., etc.), which served as collateral for their loans to Archegos.*[*\[1\]*](x-webdoc://A646B867-E480-4F8E-B2C3-CEB2FAE4F2DE#footnote-1) *They knew that Archegos would not pay back their loans, so each bank knew that it — and every other bank — would have to sell the collateral. They knew that all of this selling would crash the prices of the stocks. If news came out like “hey, Archegos is collapsing, it owns a zillion dollars worth of Viacom and Baidu and its banks are going to be liquidating those positions,” then the stocks would drop before the banks sold: Everyone would know that big sales were coming, so nobody would want to buy the shares.*

*But if the banks sold before the news came out, they might get away with it: They could sell quietly before the market caught on to the problem, and they could perhaps sell the shares for more than Archegos owed them. And in fact some banks* [*moved quickly and did fine*](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/WluyUDJCu7HugRGvVVzYWZieoPNJDMgyXABdD7KNlOzYPOoT8LQcsVj0QdXEaxZ9j1ojg2cetjjwYy52kEFimLakBPQVwIugTqw-y3zI8cLCqm3AtyLDSAFzaQpoCUYSz83kZG5mUyjzEY1w9CXyG_CDPeQdsT7I-JAIZmvcwGe_c-gWvgN_1Uxmv0AKjh-7R9Ejn7tbIwrSaZnRV0G_I-pt0mklYH_l4ScJjrZs_B868QdZrD9q9QfaKQlQ6VfNiBKuZa-MZMl4beNR_ZpGo7cY8OYa5MMm8CwwpcZSmZWMJ3wwTxVP-y1tv2xwC9mKMTZPMOmjth8rRBXG6q1FYXC2to7uYyiecqlIT3EuSkuUYKTTR0jPl3j-TQ/wLTVGF7n3XOoB_oVHG-HFo9Q3m7zyyS0/12)*, and other banks moved slowly and lost billions of dollars.*[*\[2\]*](x-webdoc://A646B867-E480-4F8E-B2C3-CEB2FAE4F2DE#footnote-2) *(Basically the fast banks’ sales alerted the market that something was going on, and the market caught on before the slow banks could sell.)*

*This might trouble you. When the banks were selling out of their Archegos positions, they knew some pretty important information that the buyers didn’t know. (They knew about Archegos’s positions, and its collapse.)

It is generally legal, in the US, to trade on information that no one else has. What is illegal is misusing someone else’s information. A chief executive officer who trades on inside information about her own stock is misappropriating that information from her shareholders*[*\[3\]*](x-webdoc://A646B867-E480-4F8E-B2C3-CEB2FAE4F2DE#footnote-3)*; a therapist who trades on what the CEO tells him in a therapy session is misappropriating that information from his patient. But if Warren Buffett knows that his purchases of a stock will move the stock up, he is allowed to buy the stock without first disclosing his plans to buy it: Trading on your own secret information is fine. (Not legal advice!)*

*What about here? The banks were trading on material nonpublic information about Archegos. Did they have a duty not to trade on it? Some investors sued to find out, “alleging that they traded in the Issuers’ stocks at the same time the \[banks\] were selling their Archegos-related positions,” that they lost money to the banks, and that the banks were doing insider trading.*

*Today they lost in a federal appeals court. Here is* [*the opinion*](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/97hFJfqAr2mhGrj-A5HwQ_eRFAvLk_Wn-K8XLNGmSPp3FAQ-0BSDcDO97KSPvoiRHpvIAn9qR7zNVR3RtEzq4_wEByDmljFFT6nxP-YxccEKfqmEkvNj1RTnFmdi3aG4MC9YC32me2lqgGNJDgtbNNajihh9YIyisnTO1JcO8GQV0EnBch_8JNdrLXGAuWhac7skT5lMyqWRCVStp-zAsnvWAXVIA28iAlS81vj1SmSriw1E40JMVy2Ap-LqkfPpiKNtahQ--gkH7WTrlT_581apOFb50zjZ8dfQgY1c95MaW_ow8alBnSSrvERRcV53se8s44sKlnUCisVfVvjcjSw9VpU4yqR4VhcmaAseQRUG28dKt3tR8IHUk9E/9dV5vdL4KpX6ytnBOaJMk4EXxihcieba/12)*. To be insider trading, the court writes, there has to be evidence that “either (1) Archegos owed a fiduciary or fiduciary-like duty to the Issuers’ shareholders or (2) \[the banks\] owed a fiduciary or fiduciary-like duty to Archegos.” The first is clearly not true: Archegos was an outside shareholder of its companies, and had no special relationship or inside information.*

*The second possibility — that the banks had some duty to Archegos not to trade on their information about its collapse — is more plausible, but the court rejected that too:*

>

*This strikes me as completely correct. The whole point of lending money to a hedge fund collateralized by its stock positions is that, if you send the hedge fund a margin call and it doesn’t post more money, you can blow out of the stock before it collapses. If you had to disclose “hey our customer is collapsing and we gotta sell its stock,” the stock would be worthless as collateral.*

*Still it is quite harsh on the buyers! They bought stock for way more than it was worth, because the banks knew something that they didn’t. Doesn’t seem fair. But the lesson is that insider trading isn’t about fairness""*",209,47,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nix7kh/insider_trading_is_legal_in_the_united_states/,year,Basics / Getting Started,0.92

1i91gaf,2025-01-24,2025-01-24 12:53:57,Is the S&P 500 risky after two years of outsized returns?,"The S&P 500 returned 26% in 2023 and another 23% in 2024. After such outsized returns for two consecutive years, many investors fear that a negative return is just around the corner. They consider selling their stocks and remaining on the sidelines to wait for a meaningful correction. However, it is highly risky to sell stocks and try to time the market, even though the stock market has rewarded investors with excessive returns for two years in a row.

Let’s see what history has taught us since 1930. Since then, there have been only three occasions in which the S&P 500 has rallied more than 20% per year for two consecutive years. The first back-to-back rally above 20% in annual return was in 1935-1936. Then, in 1937, the S&P 500 plunged 39%. Therefore, those who sold their stocks after two years of excessive returns were vindicated in that occasion. However, that period was within the depths of the Great Depression, the worst crisis in the history of the stock market.

The second period with back-to-back annual returns in excess of 20% was in 1954-1955, with a 45% return in 1954 and a 26% return in 1955. The S&P 500 gained another 3% in 1956. Moreover, it corrected 14% in 1957 but it surged 38% in 1958. As a result, it was highly risky to try to time the market because most market timers would have risked missing a long-term bull market, with outsized returns until 1972.

Finally, the third period with back-to-back annual returns in excess of 20% was 1995-1996. The S&P 500 rallied 34% in 1995 and 20% in 1996. Many investors certainly felt that it was a time to take some profits and wait for a correction but the market proved its unpredictable nature. Not only did the market not take any breath, but it kept rallying impressively. It ran 31% in 1997, another 27% in 1998 and 20% in 1999. Therefore, those who missed most of the breathtaking bull market missed outsized returns.

The most important lesson from the above instances is the fact that investors should not try to time the market. Obviously, the S&P 500 is unlikely to offer a return above 20% for a third consecutive year. However, it can very well continue advancing for many more years. No-one can predict the return of the S&P 500 reliably in the short run but it is very likely that the index will keep offering an approximate average annual return of 10% over the long run. Such a return is attractive, particularly given that the S&P 500 has proved an ideal security to offset inflation while it also has an exceptionally attractive risk/reward profile. Therefore, I advise investors to remain invested for the long run and avoid the temptation of timing the market.

this could be big. glp-1 drugs are exploding in demand and costco might be trying to make them mainstream. feels like the same playbook as their cheap gas and rotisserie chicken — low margin, high traffic.

what i like is that pharmacy revenue is already growing ~15% y/y and this could add another membership hook. costco’s healthcare angle could increase renewal rates and average spend per member. not sure it moves eps much yet, but it strengthens the moat.

for novo nordisk, it’s another u.s. distribution channel before eli lilly’s zepbound ramps up. both stocks are expensive right now (costco ~45x earnings, novo ~40x), but this kind of real-world expansion gives them more durability long term.

1ny05x8,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 13:34:00,Why Pfizer is a massive buy,"Let's be honest, owning Pfizer for the last few years has been brutal. The stock's been hammered since the COVID highs, and the market is pricing it for dead. The story is that the sugar rush from the pandemic is over, and what's left is just a boring, slow-growth pharma giant facing a patent cliff.

But I think the market has this completely wrong. They're looking backwards at declining vaccine sales. When you look at what's actually happening under the surface, you see a company making some huge, smart moves for the future.

First, they just cut a landmark deal with the White House that takes a massive political risk (crippling tariffs, price controls) completely off the table. That alone is a game-changer. Second, they're using their COVID cash to build two new sources of growth. They spent $43 billion buying Seagen, a world leader in next-generation cancer drugs, and just made another multi-billion dollar purchase to get into the massive obesity market.

And the stock is dirt cheap. It's trading at a P/E ratio of around 14.5 while the S&P 500 is at nearly 24. On top of that, you get paid a 6.3% dividend yield just to wait for everyone else to catch on.

The market sees a value trap, but I see a de-risked, high-yield innovator at a cheap price.

UK's largest pet supplies retailer. Has its hands in every part of the lifetime of the pet. Toys, food, grooming, vet care, you name it all under the same roof. Loyalty program leads to stickiness in customers and its large presence and essential services creates a moat. Add to this that the pet industry is often considered recession-resistant I think this could be a good pick.

They are looking for a new CEO after the immediate departure of the old CEO after she issued a drop in previous profit guidance for the year, new one being 100 million pounds. Issue is that people in the UK are suffering from low salaries & inflation so the pet market is subdued. So the instability has put a lot of downward pressure on the stock.

So that is the risk. Value here is that they have consistently returned capital to shareholders, we have a 5.65% dividend yield at a PE of 12.6 + a very manageable debt (just 2x free cash flow). Good buyback program in place and they consistently reduce no. of total shares by 3-5% each year.

1nxsfij,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 08:17:16,Capital B is like btc in 2011,"Why Capital B deserves attention among Bitcoin equities

Capital B is quietly building what MicroStrategy made famous but doing it in a cleaner, more disciplined and fully European way.
Here’s what sets it apart. 

1. Pure Bitcoin exposure
Capital B’s balance sheet is made up entirely of Bitcoin - 100 %. No trading, no derivatives, no hedging.
The company doesn’t speculate, it accumulates. Its only goal: increase the number of sats per share over time. The purest publicly-listed Bitcoin play in Europe.

2. Regulated European structure
Listed on Euronext Paris, Capital B operates under full EU regulation (AMF, IFRS, AML). Institutional investors, funds and individuals can gain Bitcoin exposure without self-custody or U.S. regulatory risk. It bridges traditional equity markets and the Bitcoin economy.

3. Zero debt, zero leverage
Unlike MicroStrategy (levered with billions in convertibles), Capital B carries no debt at all. No margin calls No liquidation risk No dilution spiral. An unlevered treasury built to survive any bear market.

4. Value-accretive capital raises
When Capital B issues new shares, it does so at a premium to NAV. That means every raise increases the BTC per share ratio for all holders. It’s one of the few listed companies where new capital = higher intrinsic value.

5. Long-term investor base
Roughly 62 % of shares are held by long-term investors : founders, strategic funds (TOBAM, Fulgur Ventures), and early Bitcoin figures like Adam Back. This creates a natural volatility buffer: when weak hands sell, the core doesn’t.
Few Bitcoin equities have a shareholder base this stable.

6. Transparency & proof of holdings
Regular public updates include:
Bitcoin holdings
Average purchase price
Share count/NAV
Treasury changes

Anyone can verify the real BTC per share - a level of transparency most ETFs don’t offer.

7. Small-cap asymmetry
With a market cap near €100 – 150M (depending on BTC price), Capital B still has high convexity. A doubling of Bitcoin’s price could easily mean more than a doubling of the stock due to scarcity, liquidity, and sentiment effects. The early-stage version of what MicroStrategy became after its first BTC cycle.

Capital B = Europe’s clean Bitcoin treasury.
100 % Bitcoin exposure
0 % debt / 0 % derivatives
Regulated & transparent
62 % held by long-term investors
High convexity + low structural risk

It’s not a meme stock — it’s a disciplined Bitcoin treasury built for the next decade.

Super low P/E, growth story across 20+ platforms (48.2 % latest half), raised guidance, etc. At first glance, it screams “hidden gem.”

But the more I look, the more I feel like this could be a value trap — and I can’t quite put my finger on the exact reason.

A few things that stand out to me:

Revenue growth looks strong, but a lot of it is acquisition-driven. Yes, management says ~59% of growth was organic, which sounds good, but I still wonder how sustainable that is across so many different verticals.

They’re very acquisitive. Constantly buying new platforms in different industries. That creates complexity and execution risk, and makes it hard to judge whether the “core” business is actually stable.

The valuation is extremely cheap (like 3.2x free cash flow, do they have quite a bit of debt because of acquisitions,  ev to fcf is 5.2 ), and they still expect to grow 17 precent next year) That makes me think the market knows something I don’t. Sometimes cheap really does mean cheap for a reason.

My gut feeling: TPG might be a classic roll-up play where acquisitions boost the top line, but eventually integration, debt, or flatlining organic growth could catch up.

Does anyone here have a stronger view on this? Am I overthinking it and this is just a massively overlooked stock, or is there a hidden bear case (governance, leverage, industry cycles) that explains why it’s priced like this?

Curious to hear other opinions and maybe somebody found something i didn't.

Still in the process of learning how to analyse stocks. I finally took my courage in hand and opened for the first time a 10-k form. I opened Cadence Design, as I thought the business was interesting with a reasonably strong MOAT. 

What struck me is how analytical and research/statistic-oriented it is. Everything is very factual, number-driven. I guess it is normal for a SEC filling? I looked up the CEO, and he is an Electrical Engineer doctor (which seem to reflect well the tone of the paper I read).

Now comes my question. What are you trying to find out when reading a 10-k filling, especially when trying to figure out the overall business mind? Because I surprised myself wondering: Management and CEO obviously are top of their fields, but can it translate well in long-term business growth ? Numbers seem good too - is it the most important (only way) to look at it ?

I’ve been investing for over 5 years, holding around 15–20 stocks plus 5 ETFs (100% equities), mostly U.S. and Canadian with a few Chinese tech names. My CAGR has been close to the U.S. index.

Lately, I’m getting concerned about market risk and realized I haven’t used any portfolio protection. I’m considering:

Stop-loss orders (15–20% for stocks, wider for ETFs/quality names).

Options (buying puts, though it seems like more work).

Diversification into gold or bonds.

What do you usually do to protect your portfolio? Any other suggestions?

1nx26pt,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 11:25:30,$BWB - Disciplined Regional Bank: The case for Bridgewater Bancshares,"Ticker: $BWB - Bridgewater Bancshares
Price(as of posting): $17.07
YTD: +28% (started ~13, has climbed as earnings and buybacks held up)


Why I’m watching-

Earnings: Q2 EPS beat ($0.37 vs $0.35 est). Net interest margin widened 11 bps QoQ. Nonperforming assets remain ~0.2% — very clean credit.

Book value: Tangible book per share is up to $14.21 as of June 30, 2025 (from $13.49 YE 2024).

Capital return: They’ve been buying stock.
2024: ~446k shares at $11.60 avg (~1.6% of float).

Q2 ’25: another 122k at $12.80 avg ($1.6M).
$13.1M remains under the plan, extended through Aug ’26.

Growth outlook: Management is guiding for mid–high single digit loan growth in 2025 and expects margin to hold or expand modestly if rates cooperate.

Valuation:
P/E ~14× (peers ~9–12×, higher-quality niche banks 12–13×).

P/B ~1.0–1.2× (tangible ~1.2×); sector avg ~1.1–1.2×, strong names 1.3–1.5×+.

So it’s near fair vs peers but with upside if ROE/margins hold.


Rate backdrop:

The Fed already cut 25 bps in Sept ’25. Loan yields will drift down, but BWB’s reported deposit costs have also started to fall (3.40% → 3.18% Q1 → 3.16% Q2). If deposit costs keep easing, margins can hold. If they stay sticky while loans reset lower, NIM compresses.

Minnesota macro tailwinds:

State finances are solid: Minnesota ended FY24 with revenues above forecast and continued job/wage growth.
The Minneapolis Fed’s Ninth District data shows a stable labor market and steady business activity, not booming, but resilient.

State development programs (like the Growth Loan Fund for small businesses) and healthy tax receipts help commercial lending demand.
Housing/new construction has cooled a bit with higher rates, but population and business activity keep the credit environment stable for a Twin Cities–focused lender.


What are the risks?

Deposit costs stay sticky as rates fall, squeezing margin.

Concentration: Top 10 borrowers ~18% of loans, top 10 depositors ~17% of deposits.

CRE exposure: Local commercial real estate weakness would hit harder than for diversified banks.
Capital/regulatory limits could slow buybacks.
Integration risk from the First Minnetonka City Bank acquisition.


So where could we be headed?

Base: $17.50–$20 if margins stay intact and loan growth materializes.

Bear: $12–$14 if deposit costs remain high or CRE credit cracks.

Bull: $22+ if ROE stays strong, FMCB integrates cleanly, and they keep buying stock near book.

A small but disciplined regional bank: clean credit, growing tangible book, active buybacks, fair valuation, and a stable Minnesota economy to lend into. The bet is steady ROE + capital return + possible re-rating. It’s not a moonshot, but a well-priced buy & hold.",0,0,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nx26pt/bwb_disciplined_regional_bank_the_case_for/,new,Stock Analysis,0.5

1nwuti4,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 05:54:07,Realistic 10-year S&P 500 Returns,"**Are 10% annual returns realistic for the next decade?**  
Most investors on the internet talks about the expected 10% annual return, based on historical returns.  
But is that true for the market today?

Historically the market is much cheaper than today, many investors seem not to care about valuations, and think AI will make explosive growth which will justify current valuations. However, we have a P/E over 31, and a Shiller P/E over 40, history tells us this won't end pretty.

Lets look at the numbers and model out the scenarios, to see what we can expect for returns.  
For this model we need a low, medium and high terminal P/E (what P/E will the S&P 500 end at in 10 years)  
and we need low, medium and high estimated earnings growth numbers.

Historically P/E has a median of 15, this is too low since it goes back to the 1800s, but in the past 50 years, the P/E median is \~20, in the past 20 and 10 years, it's \~25.

So let's go with:

* low: 20
* mid: 25
* high: 30

For growth estimations I looked at the past 20 years of earnings, 50% of the years were below or equal to 4% CAGR, which means this is most likely, and 20% of the years were above or equal to 8% CAGR.

To give some room for more expected growth, let's go with:

* low: 4%
* mid: 6.5%
* high 10% (only seen 4 times since 1880)

*(Note: these aren’t conservative.)*

We now can get the terminal value:

Terminal value = current EPS \* (expected growh rate)\^10 years  
current EPS = 219.52

From here we can see what Compounded Annual Growth Rate will get to the current share price from the terminal value in 10 years. For my estimations I get the following annual returns from the estimations:

* high: \~9% annual return
* mid: \~4.7% annual return
* low: \~1% annual return

This shows another picture of what is preached about 10% annual returns.

1nwondf,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 23:37:11,Most Value Investors Under perform in the long run.,"Hey All,

I want to make it clear from the beginning, I am no one to criticize anyone else. I just want to express my humble opinion on value investing. Please take this in the best manner, i have no intention to come off as rude, arrogant or overall just a real annoying critique.

I think most people read graham or maybe the new value investors don't because of shortened attention spans. Look what worked for graham was only true because the markets were wholly inefficient and he just applied common sense, buffets early partnerships made some changes and showed signs of the shift to quality but mainly went of graham principles. Munger changes that of course, and today i believe that is really the right way to go. Most value investors statistically underperform; they just get caught up in the whole cheap thing, which is just outdated, and is a lot harder to make greater returns on. Spin offs special situations such things are not really my cup of tea, my thoughts on quant in value investing is that if dcf and the rest of qaunt analysis were so great, anyone with a computer and some algorithms would be making great returns. the former is of course not true.

What is true is finding high quality businesses with competitive advantages and barriers of entry that can be bought at a reasonable fair price. For this one must accumulate insanse amounts of knowledge to be ready when such a opportunity arises, they must research like Li Lu's famous timberland story, and 99% won't. I think that there is oppurtunity, just not for those looking for net - nets for the most part, its just a lot more difficult and the odds are not in your favour. The talks on microsoft and other big names are fine, but 20x earnings is not reasonable, and beyond tech stocks what are the real competitive advantages of LULU for example since thats trendy, i never see that. Maybe i am biased to Munger, but the numbers back him, the logic and common sense as well. 

Just my thoughts.

By Jordan Blum

Editor, Energy

October 2, 2025 at 3:30 PM EDT

The big move by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to buy the chemicals business of oil giant Occidental Petroleum for nearly $10 billion is a double win for Berkshire, analysts say, in Buffett’s potential swan song deal before retiring at the end of December.  The Oct. 2 deal is the first-ever Berkshire announcement that quotes incoming CEO Greg Abel and doesn’t mention the current chief executive by name.

The OxyChem business will operate as a strong stand-alone for Berkshire, while the deal should boost Berkshire’s nearly 30% ownership of parent Oxy because the Houston company will use the bulk of the proceeds to pay off the high debt load that’s dragged down its stock in recent years, said Doug Leggate, Wolfe Research energy analyst.

“It’s genius. It’s certainly a win-plus for Berkshire because it also helps the company that they own 30% of,” Leggate said. “It’s completely self-serving, it’s logical, and—not in any nefarious way—definitely helpful.”

The $9.7 billion, all-cash OxyChem deal is Berkshire’s largest since scooping up insurance player Alleghany in 2022. In recent years, Berkshire has focused on selling off stakes of its investments and is sitting on a whopping mound of almost $350 billion in cash.

Leggate called OxyChem a steady potential cash cow that focuses on its growing chlor-alkali business manufacturing PVC (polyvinyl chloride) resin for piping, construction materials, medical equipment, and more. Its business largely moves with the housing market, which could soon benefit more from falling interest rates. “It’s a low-volatile, uncontroversial, niche business that has pricing power given the market structure,” he said.

The 95-year-old Buffett announced his retirement plans in May, although Abel has long been tapped as his eventual successor.  Abel, the longtime Berkshire vice chairman of noninsurance operations, praised the OxyChem deal and Oxy CEO Vicki Hollub in the announcement.

“Berkshire is acquiring a robust portfolio of operating assets, supported by an accomplished team,” Abel said in the announcement. “We look forward to welcoming OxyChem as an operating subsidiary within Berkshire. We commend Vicki and the Occidental team for their commitment to Occidental’s long-term financial stability, as demonstrated by their plan to use proceeds to reinforce the company’s balance sheet.”

Berkshire did not immediately respond to interview requests.

Specifically, Oxy said, it will use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce debt and bring its principal debt below the $15 billion target it set following the late 2023 acquisition of Permian Basin oil producer CrownRock for $12 billion.  Hollub said the deal helps Oxy focus on its core oil and gas business, especially in the booming Permian, while strengthening its financial position through debt reduction.

OxyChem represents almost 20% of Oxy’s total pretax income, bringing in more than $1 billion annually.

**The Berkshire-Oxy courtship**

The intimate Berkshire-Oxy relationship dates back to 2019 when Oxy entered a dramatic bidding war with the much larger Chevron to acquire oil producer Anadarko Petroleum.  Anadarko had chosen to sell to Chevron when Oxy came back with a larger $38 billion offer that included much more cash—too good for Anadarko to turn down.

That offer only came to fruition when Hollub took a whirlwind trek to Omaha to see Warren Buffett and his Berkshire team. After a 90-minute meeting, Buffett committed $10 billion to finance the merger in exchange for preferred shares and a stake in the expanded Oxy.

The agreements allowed Oxy to boost its cash offer to about 80% of the purchase price in its successful David-versus-Goliath bidding war against Chevron.

Since then, Buffett has increased Berkshire’s stake in Oxy to more than 28%.

But in the meantime, the big acquisitions left Oxy with a much greater debt load, especially going into the pandemic in 2020. Oxy barely survived the downturn, slashing its dividend from 79 cents per share each quarter down to just one penny. Since then, the dividend has risen back up to 24 cents—still much lower than in 2019.

The OxyChem deal largely solves the debt problem, although Oxy won’t begin redeeming Berkshire’s preferred shares—and their 8% annual interest—until 2029.

“In a world where crude \[pricing\] is softening, Oxy has too much debt. It’s unequivocal that it’s a good thing for Oxy to raise cash and pay down debt,” said Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Pickering Energy Partners consulting and research firm.

While Abel may already be in the dealmaking driver’s seat for Berkshire, Pickering said, “\[Buffett\] was the driver of the original Oxy investment, so I’m sure he was involved.”

Pickering compared Berkshire’s likely double win for both OxyChem and Oxy to a “circular loop” like the booming AI sector’s recent investments in one another’s companies: “AI is in a circular loop where Nvidia gives money to somebody, who gives money to somebody, who gives it back to Nvidia.”

The only problem for Oxy on Oct. 2, though, was its stock surprisingly fell by 7%. Oxy had outperformed the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF by about 2.5% this week through Oct. 1, largely baking in the deal before the Oct. 2 announcement.

Oxy is selling its chemicals business at a bit of a discount when the broader petrochemical sector is near a cyclical trough.

Pickering said there was some “sell the news dynamic” at play. But the sale also diminishes some hopes that Berkshire would buy Oxy in its entirety, potentially hurting the stock.

“By buying these pieces, the odds that he’s going to buy it all have gone down,” Pickering said.

A year ago, this reporter asked Hollub at what point Berkshire might control too much Oxy stock. Her response: “We would never consider it to be too much.”",209,18,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwinqk/warren_buffetts_berkshire_hathaway_may_have/,new,Buffett,0.96

What most fail to realize stuck in this trap is that they're likely going to underperform the index with a high degree of certainty - Which begs the question why are you working so hard to lock in mediocrity?

Understand that benchmark 10% returns P/A should be your discount rate and what you apply to your stock valuation calculations - not a 10/20 Year treasury - This achieves 2 things: You start looking for companies growing higher than the index and you naturally will be purchasing them at a lower price because of a higher discount rate.

Dividend investing is dead and likely to become worse - People thinking about cash flow when their purchasing power is declining not to mention the risk of the stock going down below your purchase price and yielding less % on your $ invested - You're better off owning real estate and getting rental income with some capital appreciation - and if you can't afford Real estate why bother chasing cash flow on peanuts lol - you're essentially falling behind even faster - the other option would be a term deposit if you're at a stage in life where preservation is more important than growth and the yield on cost is higher than real estate rental income.

If you're not prepared to gamble in markets somewhat for out performance you may as well call it a day and just own the index and accept your fate.

Holding cash if you don't have great entries on stuff now makes some sense because it allows you the opportunity to buy bargains when markets shit the bed/good companies fall out of favor. (you will naturally be doing this while using a 10% discount rate) and have a list of companies you want to own.

I think this is one of those opportunities I found pretty recently.

**Steep Hill Inc.** (formerly known as Canbud Distribution Corporation) was incorporated to provide hemp-based science-backed products and services. It started the wind-down and stopped operations at the end of 2022. The business has been trying to acquire other businesses to continue operations, unsuccessfully. This seems to be their current strategy, to find and acquire another business. The businesses' filings doesn't give the updated balance sheet report, but I found the updated working capital in the foot notes. based on the 2024 filing, I can see they have no long term liabilities, so this working capital number I found is the up to date liquidation value of the business.

**These figures are in (CAD)**

* $56,000 in cash
* $2,000,000 in deposits
* $106,000 in liabilities
* NCAV(liquidation value): $1,950,000
* Market Cap: $1,050,000
* Share Price: $0.065
* Under Valued: by 46%

**Risks**

Possible current share dilution authorized for the management is 8%.

The real risk of this shell style business is slow burn of cash over time. If we estimate a 300k burn a year, this business is still at a liquidation value of 1.35M in 2 years, at which point I'd sell it if the management didn't make any meaningful change.

**Predicted Outcome**

The most likely outcome is a slow burn of cash over a year, then the business acquires another business and improves/continues operation. In this case, the business will be 36% under valued when it unlocks value for the shareholders, which would be a 57% return.

The next most likely is that they have a merger/acquisition sale to another business, or liquidate their business.

* If they do it immediately, the return is an 86% return.
* If they wait a year before doing this, it will be a 57% return.
* If they wait 2 years before doing this, it will be a 29% return.

My position size is 5.5% of my capital, and I plan on holding onto this stock for 2-3 years, or until the market cap gets close to the NCAV(liquidation value).",3,17,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwh991/little_ben_graham_cigarbutt_if_youd_like_a_puff/,new,Stock Analysis,0.8
1nwg9lu,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 17:14:08,Securities analysis is a deluded fallacy. ( Under the current monetary regime.),"
Don’t shoot me, I’m just a messenger.

However, my assertion is quite straightforward:

Under our current monetary system, which relies heavily on hyper-stimulated credit injections into the economy, securities analysis and business valuation have become almost irrelevant. This is due to the unreliable nature of economic calculations caused by central banking monetary policies.

The financial economy serves as the primary conduit for central banking policies. Financial assets experience an initial surge in value before the underlying economy has fully assessed the viability of capital investments. This disconnection fuels the boom, leading to further capital misallocation into speculative ventures with minimal real demand or profit potential.

Essentially, stocks rise and continue to rise due to the influence of the Federal Reserve. Wall Street exacerbates this situation through its marketing and pressure-selling tactics. After all, Wall Street’s primary revenue streams are securitization and trading. As the boom continues to grow and persist, Wall Street’s wealth increases accordingly.

Therefore, professional investors, most hedge fund managers, financial gurus, social media promoters, and most “professionals” in finance are essentially opportunistic beneficiaries of easy money and loosened credit injections into the financial markets.

For instance, consider Warren Buffett’s case. In 1980, he was worth $500 million and was already one of the wealthiest individuals in the world. Back then, there were only 13 billionaires worldwide. Fast forward 40 years, and Warren Buffett’s net worth has skyrocketed to $150 billion, while the global number of billionaires has increased to 3,000. Simultaneously, the value of the dollar has declined by nearly 74% in the same period. This means that while savers have been impoverished, asset holders have experienced significant wealth effect.

And you wonder why you can’t afford a home Millennial!!! (lol)

The value of Buffett’s wealth is not solely attributed to his exceptional stock-picking abilities but rather to his long-term investments in high-quality financial assets added and abetted by inflation.


All these financial metrics and accounting calculations are meaningless in an inflationary environment. However, accountants, CPAs, CFAs, academics, MBAs, and other investment experts need to earn a living, so they market their systems, books, newsletters, and other products to the public.

Essentially, the entire investment industry is somewhat  a pyramid scheme built on easy money. The moment the Federal Reserve reduces its money supply, the entire system collapses quickly.

Fortunately for the Wall Street professionals and gamblers , the current neo-Keynesian academics at the helm of the Federal Reserve have no intention of ever cutting off the flow of money and credit. Therefore, the boom may continue and spread to other tokenized vehicles and investment schemes.

The good news is that you can simply buy and hold great businesses and forget about it. Cash is toxic!

By the way,

Ben Graham operated under a more sound financial system, similar to Natural Finance under the Gold Standard. Since 1971, the world has entered an era of inflation and a fiat financial system. Securities analysis and economic calculation cannot be conducted in the same way in both regimes.

1nwd9xa,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 15:23:43,Why is Algoma Steel at ATL even with positive news,"Today we got more positive news that they are partnering with Alberta government Transpod project and following yesterday’s news of Ontario government loans. It’s literally at all time low this year (-68%) after this news. I understand this company has been struggling since the tarrif threats but now we finally have good news of investing this company. So why plummet more?  

A bit of background of the stock leading up to recent lows

Algoma Steel (ASTL) trades at ~$3.20 USD with recent weakness tied to soft steel pricing and tariff pressures. Q2 results showed declining revenue, negative EBITDA margins, and a net loss, with shipments around 472K tons. Balance sheet stress remains as liabilities outweigh assets, though government support has been secured. Transition to electric arc furnace (EAF) technology is underway, with first-steel production achieved, positioning for cost efficiencies and lower emissions. Near-term challenges include margin compression and high input costs, but long-term prospects hinge on EAF ramp-up, policy support, and global steel demand recovery.

1nwa6yo,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 13:29:43,FactSet - If you missed out on Google,"I'm writing to inform you that FactSet, a financial data company with a strong competitive advantage is trading at fair value.

  
My brief thesis:

* FactSet has a strong moat. The company serves institutional investors: hedge funds, asset management companies, buy-side shops, pension shops, etc... The customers either buy a FactSet terminal, or SaaS subscription.
* The customer retention rate is above 90%.
* Manageable debt.
* Strong track record of earnings growth.
* Trading at PE of 18.5 (reasonable compared to its historical average of above 25.
* Revenue is still growing at a steady pace.
* Risks: Primary risk is that the tool could be replaced by other AI saas products. Which is a fair fear to have, however they are so deeply integrated with customers that it will be hard to rip off FactSet and replace them with a new startup. FactSet has tons of historical data and expertise in financial data market, I would expect the management to innovate to fend off competitors. 
* I would like to call out that FactSet by no means is offering margin of safety like my previous investments in baba, meta, bti, and others. However it is currently trading at a fair value.
* A very general example to understand FactSet: An analyst would pull the data either through api, or dashboard, transform the data with other third party and first party data to create dashboard/reports for management.

What do you guys think? Are there others risks that FactSet is facing, and what do you think is FactSet's fair value?",37,56,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwa6yo/factset_if_you_missed_out_on_google/,new,Discussion,0.81

1nw8hdx,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 12:26:18,Expanding Recycling Capacities at Campine nv - Global ship lease as a dividend payer?,"My favorite circular economy company is Campine nv - a belgian recycling company.  
China banned antimony export last year. since then recycling became even more attractive. they have smelter capacities, they recycle lead acid batteries, PET, Antimony, etc.  
they are the biggest producer of antimony trioxide outside of china and their share of the worlds antimony trade is over 10%.  
good amount of growth (H1 2025 had over 380 million€ in revenues) and over 24€ in EPS, which is already more than their entire record year 2024! their P/E is around 6 (if we assume that EPS for the second half will be around 11€ -which is a very conservative estimate imo) so we are assuming 35€ in EPS for the year 2025.  
this will be achieved without the acquisition which was approved yesterday. this acquisition will add another 100 million€ to yearly revenues (and cashflow-positive already - which will be even enhanced by synergy-effects, since at some place they have a surplus of metals and they will add smelting capacities..) they export into the US, Japan, India, europe and many more!  
the CEO is very conservative with predictions (you can read the last press releases) and management delivered very well over the past years.  
dividend is usually 1/3 of the Earnings so at 35€ (conservativly speaking) it will be a dividend of around 12€ so \~6% in dividends (200€ share price) .  
the interessting thing is, that the export ban of china got them a lot of new costumers in japan, india, the US etc and likely these relationships may last since campine is also consulting their costumers, since they have a big expertise (100 year company history).  
their recycling percentage will like rise (i think it was 30 or 50%) so they will hve even cheaper antimony which will enahnce margins. the downside may be, that antimony trioxide is being substituted as a flame retardand because of high prices, but in the PET production process the substitution is much less likely in the near term.  
P/S is 0.5-0.6

The press release from yesterday: [https://www.campine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251001ecoeng.pdf](https://www.campine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251001ecoeng.pdf)

Another Company that looks interessting may be global ship lease:   
they have small container ships which is a big plus imo, because climate change will have rivers at low water levels, which will enable them to manouver through low water the longest. They constantly improved their fundamentals since the new ceo took office a few years ago (less debt and higher equity etc) their P/E is around 3 and they pay over 6% in dividends. their contracts are on average over 2 years which means that they will almost earn the entire money for which the company trades at the moment (P/E 3 and over 2 years of guaranteed contracts/income streams). 

Management seems to do good work at both of the companies and climate change might boost the economical outlook for both.

Albertsons is currently at $17.35 its valued less than 11X 2024 earnings and has an EV / Sales of 0.2. Kroger was going to pay roughly $27 a share to buy ACI but it ultimately fell through for antitrust reasons. Kroger has a PE of 17 and EV / Sales of 0.4. Weis has a PE of 17 and EV / Sales of 0.3. 

Kroger will likely have to pay Albertsons a break up fee of $600 million or roughly 6% of the stock price. Albertsons also has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $2 billion so roughly 20% of the stock. During the latest quarter they bought 14.2 million shares at $22 for a total of $314.8 million. They are likely buying even more at these decreased prices. 

2024 had lower earnings of $1.64 as compared to $2.23 in 2023 but part of that was one time expenses like those related to the expenses of a failed merger. Even if the earnings stay at the $1.64 range, which with less shares is unlikely, than the **fair price for this is around $28 - $30** with a PE of 17 or EV / Sales of 0.3 based on their peers. **So more than 60% from here**. 

Potential other upsides you could get an extra $1 from Kroger paying up the $600 million, the share count be decreased even more significantly thus increasing the earnings per share, earnings could go up now that the merger costs are behind them, and Goldman listed them as one of their top 48 potential M&A candidates with a 15% to 30% probability.

1nw21pg,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 08:12:12,Rubrik (RBRK): The Next Big Thing in Cyber AI,"Rubrik (RBRK) is a high-growth, high-upside play on cyber AI.

The company provides data security and backup software that protects and restores critical business information. Its platform takes frequent, immutable snapshots of data so organizations can recover quickly from cyberattacks or outages. Think of it as a safety net across on-prem, cloud, and SaaS environments. Rubrik also organizes metadata about what data exists, where it lives, and who accessed it — helping customers comply with regulations and insurance requirements. The business model blends subscriptions and support, with a growing emphasis on software and cloud services.

AI expands the attack surface by spreading data across vector databases, SaaS tools, and model-training pipelines. Rubrik’s edge is not just preventing damage but enabling fast recovery when things break. As more teams deploy AI agents and new data stores, backups must be frequent, tamper-resistant, and easy to restore. Rubrik’s automation and policy-driven controls standardize resilience across hybrid IT. Its platform can also surface unusual activity and guide remediation, reducing costly downtime. In an era of strict regulation and board-level cyber scrutiny, data resilience becomes essential infrastructure for AI adoption.

Rubrik has built a data graph—rich metadata on backups, versions, and relationships—that improves visibility and accelerates recovery. Immutable backups raise the bar against ransomware, a top risk for AI-heavy organizations. Deep integrations with major clouds, enterprise apps, and security platforms create stickiness and reduce complexity. Over time, telemetry from thousands of environments becomes a learning advantage for detection and response. Compliance mandates make consistent backup and recovery a requirement, not an option—supporting Rubrik’s durability at the recovery layer, where budgets remain resilient even in downturns.

As AI accelerates data creation, enterprises will spend more to protect it, favoring platforms that collapse multiple tools into one workflow. Rubrik can expand wallet share by covering more workloads and increasing backup frequency within its customer base. AI-first startups and modernized IT estates create new growth avenues. A shift toward software- and cloud-delivered services should lift margins, while cross-selling security analytics on top of backup deepens engagement. With cyberattacks frequently in the headlines, recovery-focused platforms stand to benefit from urgency and board-level attention. We see Rubrik as a ~25% revenue grower with potential for >50% compounded EBITDA growth as margins expand.

Over the next year, watch for large enterprise wins, public-sector contracts, and deeper partnerships with major cloud providers. Product launches that extend coverage to AI data stores or improve automated recovery would be notable. Tighter cyber-insurance standards could indirectly boost adoption. Migration tools for legacy backup replacements may accelerate competitive takeaways, while alliances with incident-response firms or SIEM/SOAR vendors would broaden reach. ARR growth and improving retention will be key signals for the long-term thesis",12,6,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nw21pg/rubrik_rbrk_the_next_big_thing_in_cyber_ai/,new,Stock Analysis,0.83

1nvuluv,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 00:49:36,AMZN is cheaper than you think,"So I'm sure many people are looking at AMZN's P/E ratio of 33.7x and thinking that while it's more reasonable than it used to be, it's still pretty expensive. Especially when you can pickup shares of GOOGL or META at 26x. But I think a useful valuation metric to look at is the price to operating cash flow and I'll explain why.

Net income is an accounting metric that includes depreciation and amortization, and it's up to the business to decide the schedule for those, meaning they can decide, for example, that the useful life of a GPU is 6 years when in reality it's probably 2 years. Another problem is that GAAP requires companies to mark to market any investments each quarter, meaning that if a company holds shares of a different company, the change in price effects net income.

This is why investors run discounted cash flow models, because ultimately cash is what matters--not accounting results. The value of a business is the present value of the future cash you can extract from the business over its life. The problem with using free cash flow is that capex is part of the equation, and capex is highly variable year to year. Some years you may buy a new office building and a new warehouse and a bunch of warehouse equipment, and other years you might not buy anything.

Operating cash flow removes capex from the equation which allows you to simply focus on how much cash the business actually produces from its operations. Not paper gains of a stock they hold, or because they chose to extend the useful life of their assets. Just the operations.

So on a price to trailing twelve month P/OCF ratio, here are the results for the Magnificent 7 stocks:

* TSLA: 91.3x
* NVDA: 59.0x
* AAPL: 34.9x
* MSFT: 28.3x
* GOOGL: 22.1x
* AMZN: 19.4x
* META: 17.6x

Now you might think this is stupid because free cash flows are what matter. Who cares if your operating cash flow is great but you need to spend it all on capex to continue generating the cash flow? While this is true, I think it's useful to compare just the operating businesses as capex is highly variable and is a choice that doesn't need to be made in perpetuity. Now of course, AMZN is by far the most structurally capital intensive (besides TSLA? maybe?) since they actually move real stuff in the real world so that needs to be taken into consideration. 

Anyway, just thought I'd share. I think understanding the price you're paying relative to the cash generated by operations is useful and should be considered when evaluating a business' valuation.

So i like to screen within industries i like, with p/b ratios under 1.5 and p/e that is trailing compared to industry, another is NAV exceeds market price, and EPV exceeds market cap, these are rough numbers i am to do a more deep quantitative analysis after. Once i find a interesting one, i sit down and read a couple 10 - k, break down financials in a raw way, using a whiteboard to sort of visualize things. From there the balance sheet to assess asset quality and then its qualitative from there. Obviously there is more depth involved but thats what i do, curious to see how you all go about.

I know they’re not exactly a typical “deep value” stock, but they’ve got some interesting qualities:

* Market cap around \~$50B
* Net cash balance sheet (basically no debt, lots of cash reserves)
* Strong brand/IP portfolio (Mario, Zelda, Pokémon, etc.) that seems evergreen
* Switch 2
* Trades at a relatively modest P/E compared to other gaming/entertainment giants
* Dividend yield \~2–3%, with buybacks here and there

Feels like a weird mix of being a consumer brand, a hardware company, and an IP licensing play.

1nvlhpb,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 17:42:51,"Most people are better off being ""growth"" investors (including this sub)","I'm not sure if this will be insightful or dumb, but this is Reddit so there's no reason to concern myself with that... 

I think most individual investors that feel the need to buy single stocks are probably better off being what most here would describe as ""growth"" investors. (I don't agree with growth vs. value being a binary split, because growth is obviously a component of value). The market today isn't filled with net-nets (there are some), cigar butts, and stocks that trade at a discount to book or replacement/sale value. Those that do are often hard to find, messy and difficult to analyze. So you need to have a view on the future and growth prospects (it's not just pure speculation as Graham said so I don't wanna hear that).

I think most stock pickers are better off focusing on strong businesses that are growing and having more flexibility on P/E ratios rather than trying to find ""value"" based on stocks that have tanked recently. A large portion of this sub loves low P/E stocks or those down 30+% and overlook fundamental challenges simply because the stock went down and now it appears ""value."" You can put whatever stock du jour is the most talked about in this sub in that category most of the time... occasionally popular stocks here bounce back strongly, but I'm inclined to believe that may be more luck than skill... unless someone has a mention tracker going for testing... 

Those same folks look down on all the higher multiple stocks that the market loves that are strong and growing businesses. **I am not talking about the highest multiple or meme/hype stocks**, just quality businesses that people know and are most likely going to experience future success but trade at multiples around the broader market or \~25% premiums. There are so many commenters here that overlook quality and hate a company that's trading at or near all time highs and think they're smarter than the market. They also think they're smarter than the market after a recent drop and think that recent ""cheapness"" equates to value. **You hate that people buy stocks just because they went up, but do the exact same thing and buy stocks just because they went down**. Momentum is a powerful force especially with trading volumes mostly driven by passive and levered pod shops. You're fighting against that when you buy a recently tanked stocks, at least those picking ""obvious"" businesses have those as tailwinds. 

I think most people would be better off investing in ""obvious"" strong, growing companies even if everyone else loves them rather than focusing all their attention on things that have fallen and probably subjecting yourself to a lot of value traps. Great businesses have a tendency to surprise on the upside and their execution and I believe those going through issues and turnarounds have a tendency to surprise on the downside. This entire spiel I doubt many will read **does not apply to anyone who will take the time to deeply understand a business, it's economics, strength, and potential for the future** I just don't see a lot of that here (to be clear **I'm not claiming to have that ability either**...). 

If you want to buy some single stocks, but aren't going to make a career out of it the ""obvious"" ones might be your friend. I'd rather be consensus and right than contrarian and wrong... buy stocks because the business is strong and it's a reasonable price, don't fall in love with only a lower price. If you're absolutely must call yourself a value investor so you can look down on others without actually putting in the work just buy Berkshire Hathaway and call it a day... 

Anyway, subscribe to my stock tips, buy quantum computing, Palantir, ASTS, and DJT. Kidding, don't buy any of that shit now unless you're gambling.

Then considering the dilution from the 560 million in convertible notes at $55 (that’s your 12.5 percent). 

… basically, I bought a couple $55 January 2027 leaps that should let me ride it up over the next six months and cash out while (theoretically) we get another rate reduction or two, their expansion into the HELOC market continues, and people start to see ai underwriting actually does a better job at avoiding delinquency than the straight FICO system we use today. 

My really dumbed down thesis:

People are still afraid of ai underwriting when they shouldn’t be, and as their revenue CAGR continues to accelerate that fear will diminish. 

Upcoming rate cuts (including the recent rate cut) will provide fuel for their fire. 

Market expansion will continue, global expansion is inevitable. 


Edit: I should add the conversion notes @ about 35 bucks for around 600 million, so the total dilution is around thirty percent but that $80 per share forecast includes it.

1nvc4nn,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 11:58:03,JD Stock Forecast,"Hey everyone I have had some pretty solid calls this year on foreign equities, including BABA at $114 and JMIA at $2.40. I am back with another call and DD report on JD. 

Chinese equities have been abandoned by global investors, and JD.com is one of the clearest examples. The stock fell from over $100 in 2021 to below $30 in 2023 despite remaining profitable and holding one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector.

Today JD is valued at less than 10x earnings, 0.3x sales, and just above book value. It sits on more than $27 billion in cash and is using buybacks to reduce its float. This is an e-commerce and logistics leader trading at distressed multiples, while peers like Amazon (33x PE) and Alibaba (21x PE) command far higher valuations.

The recovery in 2025 is starting to take shape for China. Alibaba has already surged more than 70 percent this year as sentiment improves. JD has lagged, but volumes are rising, short interest is falling, and the stock recently broke resistance levels (200d SMA). The fundamentals point to double digit revenue growth, expanding profitability, and a long runway in AI, robotics, and fintech.

For my modeling into 2030, I assumed the following:

* **Revenue Growth Assumptions:** Modeled CAGR between 10–20% depending on macro conditions and market share trends.
* **Margin Expansion:** Forecasts net margins improving to 4–5% through cost efficiencies, logistics scaling, and AI-driven operations.
* **Buybacks:** $27B in cash could allow repurchase of 15–20% of shares by 2030, lifting EPS by 20–25%.
* **Peer Multiples:** Valuation targets based on Alibaba (\~21x P/E) and Amazon (30–40x P/E) suggest significant re-rating potential.
* **Scenario Analysis:**
   * Bear: $80 by 2030 (10% CAGR, 15x P/E).
   * Base: $140 by 2030 (15% CAGR, 20x P/E).
   * Bull: $200+ by 2030 (20% CAGR, 25x P/E, upside from AI/health/fintech).
* **Optionality:** Strategic investments in healthcare, fintech, and robotics are not fully priced in, so upside could exceed modeled cases.

This is not financial advice, but the setup resembles other moments of extreme mispricing that I have seen reverse sharply once capital flows return. JD’s logistics moat, authenticity focus, and cash reserves give it staying power in a very competitive market. 

Just because Chinese equities were punished for years, does not mean they always will be. Institutions can only ignore cash flows and valuations such as these for so long, particularly as US markets approach extreme overbought levels. 

For a less fundamental approach, JD historically lags than catches big moves from BABA. I see that happening here, and rather quickly as rally begins to broaden out. ",33,43,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://northwiseproject.com/jd-stock-forecast-2030/,new,Stock Analysis,0.91

Instead, however, they chose to market aggressively...diluting shares, over-hiring, fighting tooth and nail to establish their footprint.

By all means if you could identify this early, you would be very rich today. And this is more than just looking at accounting statements because they don't tell the whole story. Some might say look at operating cash flow but companies might hire so aggressively and pay for top talent that it could easily be negative too.   
  
So, my question is, what can one do in this situation? Valuation might be complicated I know, but how does one even identify whether this is a good company to invest in and that they aren't just wasting money. For example, the traditional value investor could easily say, Amazon in 2010 has absolutely zero moat and that they are burning cash to give people cheaper items and faster delivery and they would eventually find competitors and the pricing wars would make everyone a loser (except the customer). My point is that it is simply not very easy when companies are in this phase to identify good from bad. So how do you approach this?

Robust growth, average in the past 5 years is above 30%, both for revenue and income. 

Incredible profitability:
Operating margin - 65.5%
ROE - 67%
ROIC - 65.8%

They enjoy near monopoly in Kazakhstan with 15 million active users with 75 transactions per month (so almost all of the adult population of Kazakhstan)

One of their new tangets of growth, E-Grocery in the latest quarter, grew 57% YoY. Oh, and one of the founders is the owner of the biggest grocery store network in the country. 

They are aggressively expanding into new region, purchasing bank and market place in 100M population Turkey. And judging by H2 report from hepsiburada a turn around story is already in play.

High insider holding about 43%. Very shareholder friendly.

Surely this company should be trading at hefty valuation. Nope. Not even fairly valued. It's trading at PE of 7.19 and PEG of 0.39.

The fundamentals are strong, and IMO it's fairly priced compared with competitors in appareal retail industry. i'm genuinely curious about the low number of mentions the company has in this sub. 

A couple of important points on why I consider this a value investing play:

1. Aspirational brand but still affordable for common people, unlike luxury companies like LVMH, Hermes, and so on.

2. Healthy balance sheet and strong cash generation (highly important)

2. P/E \~25, which is reasonable for appareal industry

3. They have consistently beaten analysts’ expectations since 2021

4. they have instituted sizeable share repurchase programs

Of course, there are risks related to the fashion industry itself (NKE, LULU, etc.), but this one in particular have had a really strong performance over time. In fact, for me, it has been kind of a safe-haven asset, very resistant to tariffs and the recent economy downturns.

I feel I rarely see Berkshire's investments in the Japanese Trading Houses talked about here.

Berkshire has a massive advantage in that they're borrowing at a super low rate. And dividend yields are in the range of 4%-7% at the moment. Which not a lot of us have a chance for this arbitrage.

Given this, are they still value buys, in that we can expect prices to continue to increase?

1nv69x4,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 08:02:04,Changes to the investment strategy as the interest rates decline,"

With the interest rate approaching 4.0% and especially once it falls below 4.0% I do not consider interest rates high anymore. Therefore I have to do adjustments to my current primary strategy described almost a year ago. The main idea of the original strategy was to keep most of the money in t-bills that reliably yield close to 5% and exploit the rest of the money as a tool to frequently buy and sell(cycle) dividend paying high quality stocks. The strategy allowed earning around 10% annually with almost no risk. As yields on cash fall below 4% this strategy loses its appeal and I have to do the adjustments.

Before I explain the changes let me tell you one envious thought I had for many years… Take a look at 10yr treasury yield historic chart...

Think of a guy in the 1980s who bought 10yr or especially 30yr treasury… The guy would enjoy 15% risk free return all the way until the 2010s… The world economy grew fast in the 1980s but the modern world doesn’t grow as fast mostly because of saturation and low human breeding rates. What if 5% return is equivalent to 15% in the 1980s given the low growth of the world?

The first changes to the strategy came in May and were explained in my previous blog posts. I indeed significantly increased exposure to high quality US stocks leaving me exposed to higher risk but it also provided a better than expected returns during this period. As time goes by I now face the dilemma of still incredibly rich valuations of stocks and therefore high risks of drawdowns yet I cannot keep a significant portion of portfolio in t-bills as they provide unattractive returns. Therefore about a month ago I started the transition of t-bills based strategy to bond based strategy. I do not hold any t-bills anymore and now the money is either in stocks or bonds… This significantly increased my risk exposure but bonds will provide a much higher yield of around 6% while still being a relatively low risk instrument. The main reason why I think bonds are ok now is that I do not expect significantly higher inflation as the transition of the new administration tariffs as well as certain reduction in government expenses in certain areas show signs of fiscal responsibility and hopefully the inflation will be tamed.

The stocks strategy also changed slightly. I do not cycle dividend stocks as much as I used to and keep stock ownership much longer as well as increased exposure to some high quality stocks with lower dividend yields. I continue to buy and sell the same stocks though. So some cycling is still happening but less of it. So here it is. This is what I am doing now for the next 3-6 months. Then we will review again.

1nuy1s9,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 23:46:52,How Dating and Investing Are Similar-,"When a person is in their youth, let’s call it from sixteen to thirty years old, finding a life partner is of interest, if not a high priority, for many people. There are societies where cultural norms dictate the available universe of potential mates. The approach one takes in finding a potential mate is as diverse as there are humans. Some might place a high priority on physical appearance. Others might place a heavier weighting on friendship and compatibility. Let’s consider two approaches. The first person is a social butterfly who is active in the bar scene. Each weekend, they go with their friends to a local club to have a good time and enjoy the allure of finding their one-in-a-million dreamboat. On occasion, they might drink a few too many beverages and engage in extracurricular activities where they wind up in situations where they don’t quite remember, or are comfortable with, the person they are now faced with, or, um, ahem, even closer.

The second person approaches their social activities differently. They concentrate on attending weekly and monthly religious ceremonies and events. A heightened emphasis is placed on understanding where the potential mate is from, meeting their parents, and spending time learning what makes them happy, sad, indifferent, or excited. A friendship is formed through learning, and a common bond is established over their shared views on various subjects in which they both participate. Clearly, these are distinct approaches to the same problem. We can apply this idea to the current state of affairs in the investment world.

As of August 2025, in US public markets, there are currently approximately 4,300 ETFs (exchange traded funds) as compared to 4,200 publicly traded companies. In terms of recent trends, the number of ETFs grew by approximately 4 per day in 2025, while the available publicly traded companies continued to shrink, losing nearly 500 in 2024 alone, down from 6,500 in 1997. I bring this up because the investment world has been moving to a passive approach for a long time, and the amount of capital allocated to index and ETF-based approaches is now [greater than the active ](https://www.globaltrading.net/passive-funds-extend-their-dominance-in-equity-investments-in-2024/)methods.

Over the last few decades, the S&P 500 has been the star performer of all indexes. Currently, 35% of the S&P 500 is made up of seven companies. Many other ETFs have a similar dynamic where a few companies constitute a heavy weight within the instrument. Prominent examples include the QQQ, IVV, SPLG, VOO, VGT, and TOPT, not to mention the Ark fund complex. Investors are drawn to the lower risk, ease, and cost of indexes and ETFs and have been rewarded by owning instruments tied to large tech companies, which have grown substantially. The enthusiasm for artificial intelligence over the last few years has led to high-profile recent offerings like ARTY, CHAT, BAI, AGNT, and IVES. Investors who adopt this approach believe what has been working will continue to work. The current valuations of these assets are, let’s be kind, historically elevated. How do I approach the market knowing these facts?

One caveat, I am an active investor, so I am biased, and I am talking my book. ETFs are made up of different assets, but in most or many cases, the holdings are individual public companies. One is a derivative of the other. If you understand derivatives, you know the secondary is a function of the primary. As such, what matters is the performance of the core companies. The ETFs will rise, and fall based on those entities. So, for an active investor, more attention to ETFs is good because less capital is directed toward finding and analyzing individual companies. The number of individually listed enterprises shrinking means the strongest survive. History has proven that Darwinian concepts are applicable in markets as well. It has long been understood that the small and micro-cap areas are the most inefficient areas of the market. Inefficiency is good for active investors because it means mis-pricing. It is also excellent for active investment because if one is accurate about the analysis of a small company, the runway for expansion is much greater than a bigger entity. Conversely, investors who allocate capital into areas where there is more competition and great enthusiasm are placing a great deal of belief in the premise that massive amounts of capital allocation will yield acceptable returns. When large amounts of money are involved, just because it is spent doesn’t mean an above-average return is earned. Look at what Stevie baby spent on the Mets payroll this year, and uh, no playoffs again. In sum, less competition, fewer investors looking, mis-priced assets, large expansion possibilities versus greater numbers of instruments, top-heavy weighted assets, recent outperformance, and elevated valuations. Capital will flow where it is best treated. Markets change, like nearly everything else, though often it takes decades, not years for the difference to become evident. What one chooses is based on their own perceptions, just like choosing an ideal mate.

Mods. I understand this isn’t a typical value post. However, if the headline claims are true and $BMNR does hold $13B in ETH, this is the easiest value play ever. Just buy when Stock < NAV.

However, here are my concerns.

BitMine is a strange one. Their balance sheet shows only about $7M in assets, yet their press releases claim they hold over $13B worth of Ethereum. If that were true, they’d either be reporting billions of crypto on their balance sheet like MicroStrategy does, or they’d disclose assets under custody like Coinbase. They do neither. Instead, they issue sensational PRs while filing bare-bones financials with the SEC. To make things stranger, their previous auditor was banned by the PCAOB for issuing false audit opinions, and their new auditor is another tiny firm with its own compliance history. There’s no clear source of funds for these supposed ETH purchases, no custody revenues, and no on-chain proof. It looks less like a real business and more like a shell pumping hype with numbers that don’t add up.

1nuonf9,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 16:42:21,Constellation Software - The King is Gone,"The market is panicking about Constellation Software after its founder, Mark Leonard, resigned. The stock is down nearly 30% from its highs, caused by fears over AI and a scary looking Q2 earnings report. I believe this is a massive overreaction and a great opportunity for long-term investors.

The biggest reason for the panic is that Mark Leonard left. He's seen as the Warren Buffett of Canada. People think the magic is gone with him. It doesn't help that AI is coming for them either. The fear is that generative AI will make their huge portfolio of niche software obsolete. The Q2 earnings also looked terrible. Net income dropped by a shocking 68%.

These fears are all very real. The thing is the company is simply a machine. Leonard built a decentralised system designed to run without him. It's not reliant on one person. His replacement is a 30-year company insider, ensuring continuity. They aren't ignoring AI either. Management held a rare call to address concerns and explained that hundreds of their business units are already integrating AI to improve products and efficiency.  
  
The Q2 earnings also weren't actually bad. That 68% drop in net income I talked about was due to non-cash accounting quirks (a massive foreign exchange loss and a charge related to the rising value of their successful Topicus spin-off). The important number, free cash flow, was actually UP 20%. The business is still printing money.

The recent sell-off is driven by fear, not fundamentals. The panic has created a chance to buy a world-class compounder at a discounted price. The valuation is now much more reasonable, trading at around 23x P/FCF. To me, this is a compelling long-term opportunity.

WSJ EXCLUSIVE

By Lauren Thomas, Ben Dummett and Benoît Morenne

Sept. 30, 2025 3:49 pm ET

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is in talks to buy Occidental Petroleum’s petrochemical business for around $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal, which would be Berkshire’s largest since 2022, could come together within days, the people said. 

Houston-based Occidental is largely known for its oil-and-gas operations. The company has a market value of around $46 billion and already counts Berkshire as its largest shareholder. 

Occidental’s petrochemical division, OxyChem, manufactures and sells chemicals for use in applications including chlorinating water, recycling batteries and producing paper. The unit generated nearly $5 billion in sales in the 12 months ended in June. 

Assuming talks don’t fall apart, the OxyChem deal would be Buffett’s second big bet on chemicals. In 2011, Berkshire acquired specialty-chemicals producer, Lubrizol, for close to $10 billion, including debt. 

The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Occidental was in talks for a $10 billion deal to sell OxyChem, without identifying the buyer. The last major deal Berkshire did was in 2022, when it agreed to pay $11.6 billion to buy insurer Alleghany. 

Buffett, 95, got involved with Occidental in 2019, as Chief Executive Vicki Hollub was trying to outbid Chevron to buy Anadarko Petroleum. In a trip facilitated by Bank of America Chief Brian Moynihan, Hollub traveled to Nebraska to visit Buffett, whose company agreed to buy $10 billion of preferred shares in Occidental to bolster her $38 billion offer. 

Occidental’s fortunes have waxed and waned since then. The deal saddled the company with debt and attracted criticism from activist investor Carl Icahn. Buffett doubled down as Icahn exited, eventually buying up roughly 28% of its shares. The company’s shares more recently have come under pressure with oil prices lower.

Occidental has been selling noncore assets to raise cash to pay down debt. As of August, it said it had repaid $7.5 billion of debt. 

Berkshire, on the other hand, has been sitting on a massive cash pile. The company’s cash and Treasury bills sat at a record $344 billion at the end of June, raising investors’ eyebrows.

Buffett has said the company still prefers owning businesses, though has suggested that finding the right ones to buy can be hard. “Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned,” Buffett wrote earlier this year.

Did all the research myself and used PineAI from [PineGap.ai](http://PineGap.ai) to get better access to reports and  fillings (Hehe,Hard to not plug in as an analyst). This is not to defame anyone, Would love to know your views.  
  
Everyone knows Johnson & Johnson,household name for baby products,but it has a sinister side that is linked to the U.S. opioid epidemic.   
For long known as a gentle brand, J&J contributed to lethal epidemic. During 1990s J&J was aware of its fentanyl based opioid Duragesic which caused addictions but still promoted opioids as safe to treat chronic pain by targeting doctors and nursing facilities with communications that minimized risk.  
J&J had subsidaries like Noramco...Which were responsible for about 20–25% of raw materials like thebaine used in U.S. opioids back in the 2000s...which later led to a surge in prescriptions.   
It then contributed to an opioid crisis that has taken more than 700,000 lives since 1999 and provisional data frm CDC is estimating around 87,000 deaths in 2024.  
J&J dropped millions into patient advocacy groups,like the American pain foundation, to downplay the addiction risks and push against limits on prescriptions.   
Internal emails from 1998 even called these groups 'megaphone' and during testimony in 2021, executives tried to call this addiction as a societal issue. Societal Issue?Seriously?  
  
But then what were the consequences? J&J agreed to a $5 billion settlement in 2021 to resolve most opioid lawsuits. with payments over 9 years funding treatment and prevention. By 2024 states like Washington received their shares almost $149.5 million. Most of the thousands of lawsuits have settled, with only a few remaining in 2025.  
J&J explored controversial bankruptcy tactics like the Texas two step, to limit liabilities,though primarily for talc cases, not opioids. Their stock rose \~14% in 2025, though an unrelated talc lawsuit rejection in April caused a \~3% dip.Despite settlements, J&J’s role in the crisis profiting while addiction soared challenges its healer image.

I thought if any of this came to pass the market might re rate them to a higher multiple.  The bit below is simply an AI overview of my original thoughts I think it summerized it much better than I ever could.  Are there any other holders who purchased with a similar view to potential future revenue streams for Sirius ?

As a side note, i would think that companies like Garmin will soon see their products like inreach become obsolete as more phones and other devices end up connected to a satellite network.

I'd like to share a list of companies that, based on my analysis, appear to be trading at a significant discount to their intrinsic value, offering a potential margin of safety. My approach is to find good businesses that are temporarily out of favor with the market.

I've focused on quantifiable metrics like P/B ratio, debt levels, and cash flow generation. Here are a few examples from the list that I believe fit the value investing framework:

* **Allos ($ALOS3 - Brazil):** A classic Graham-style play. The market is valuing this real estate company at approximately 50% of its asset value, and it operates with no long-term debt burdening its cash flow.
* **Barclays ($BCS - UK):** This bank is currently trading below its book value with a P/B of 0.81, despite a history of consistent and growing profits. Seems like a clear disconnect between price and value.
* **Global Payments ($GPN - US):** A wonderful company, in Buffett's terms, that has seen its price fall. Its strong financials and ability to generate cash remain intact, presenting what could be a compelling long-term opportunity.

I'd appreciate any critiques on this analysis from a value perspective. Do you see strong, durable moats in any of these businesses, or are there value traps I might be overlooking?

I currently own these three stocks in my portfolio with equal-weight, 33% each.

First of all, I want to hear some advice about my first stock.

  
1. [Gambling.com](http://Gambling.com) (GAMB)

This company is rapidly growing with several M&As. It has a low valuation, although a temporary profit decline has pushed its PE ratio to 20, which seems high.

This company originally does performance marketing for online gambling sites worldwide. It stems from the growth of global online gambling industry. Before 2024, the company has done M&A to acquire influential domains. [https://www.rotowire.com](https://www.rotowire.com) is one of them.

By the way, in 2024, this company did M&A with Odds Holdings owning OddsJam which is the #1 platform for quantitative/mathmetical/calculative online gamblers. Revenue from this part increased by four times compared to last year.

The temporary profit decline is because of *SAFE(Simple Agreement for Future Equity*). It means that the greater performance Odds Holdings will show, the better rewards that components of Odds Holdings will get. Because Odds Holdings demonstrated better performance than it contracted, a cost was incurred for accounting purposes without any cash outflow. This also explains the seemingly low current ratio, which fell from above 1 to 0.59.

I think this stock price plunge is quite irrational. Because I strongly believe the profit will be improved from next quarter. My target price is around $23, up from the current $8.2.

1nuaotq,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 07:31:48,Morio Denki 6647,"I bought another Japanese net-net for my portfolio. Here are the main characteristics:

* 4x Earnings
* 79% of NCAV
* 53% of TBV
* Recent repurchases

[https://cristianleon1200.substack.com/p/morio-denki-6647](https://cristianleon1200.substack.com/p/morio-denki-6647)

Morio Denki—TSE: 6647—is a tiny railway equipment manufacturer located in Tokyo, Japan. With a market cap of just ¥2.6 billion, or \~$17 million, it's the smallest company I’ve bought on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Here are a couple of examples of what they manufacture:

Similar to the previous Japanese companies I’ve shared, what I like about Morio Denki is its solid balance sheet, stable business, cheap valuation, and capital allocation improvement.

**Balance Sheet**

Unfortunately, most of this company’s current assets aren’t in cash, only 16%; even adding the marketable securities, you get that only 39% of the current assets are 100% liquid. The weakest line of Morio’s current assets, inventory, represents a modest 38%. While less than ideal, the fact that inventory represents a bigger portion of current assets than in other net-nets doesn’t make me discard 6647 right away, because the ratio of current assets to total liabilities is still >2, thus giving enough protection in case of liquidation. 

**Business**

Like many other small Japanese companies, Morio has been in business for over 100 years, having been founded in 1911. Over the last decade, revenue has been stable, oscillating between ¥7 and 10 billion, with no operating or net losses. The last 10-year average operating income is ¥369 million, and the net income is ¥232 million. This means the business has generated an average 5.6% return over ¥4.15 billion of average equity. While this is not great at all, at least the business is not losing money and can keep existing for the foreseeable future.

**Valuation**

Morio Denki is trading at 79% of its net current asset value and approximately 10 times normalized earnings. From a simple liquidation analysis, the business is clearly trading at a discount; you’re getting the current assets at a 21% discount with the machines and properties for free. If we say that the tangible assets can generate close to a 6% return, and the business can be purchased at half of the net tangible assets, you are getting an 11-12% return on your investment. Even if this hypothetical return never occurs, and the company needs to be liquidated, buying at a deep enough discount, we are unlikely to lose money.

**Capital Allocation**

Morio Denki has adopted new policies to improve capital returns and the price-to-book ratio. In 2024, the company repurchased 2.1% of the shares outstanding. This year so far, they’ve repurchased 1.5%. While these numbers are not anywhere close to those of other aggressive repurchasers, it's adding value to remaining shareholders. In their recent press release, “Measures to achieve management that takes capital costs and stock prices into consideration,” they stated that their objective is to make the stock price closer to 1x book value. And these repurchases are the first step.

A more effective way to improve the price-to-book ratio in Japan is to increase the dividend payout ratio by announcing a 30-50% dividend payout ratio, or a dividend on equity policy. In the last decade, the dividend per share has oscillated between ¥30 and ¥60 per share; by adopting a 40% payout ratio, the business would pay around ¥80-90 per share, bringing more predictable returns for investors. 

While they haven’t adopted a set dividend payout ratio or a dividend on equity policy, they check out another variable that I look for in Japanese net-nets: tangible book value per share growth.

Tangible book value per share has compounded at 5.6% in the last decade, which is not terrible considering they’ve paid decent dividends over time. In the 2025 bar, there is a 12% growth with respect to the previous year; this higher growth is due in part to good business performance, but also due to share repurchases at ½ of TBV. In August, they repurchased an extra 21k shares, or 1.5%, at \~50% of TBV. This is clearly accretive to shareholder wealth and will boost TBV/share growth. TBV/share growth shows that the business is not burning away the shareholders’ capital and is actually compounding it over time.  

**How might this investment go wrong?**

1. I do not have any special insight into the business. I do not know if management are crooks or if the business will become obsolete.
2. No further shareholder returns are conducted. The company might not conduct further share repurchases; not returning capital in Japan will likely make the stock a value trap.
3. In the past, the company has implemented measures against large share purchases by other entities. This might mean that they are reluctant to be acquired, which might block a rapid return of capital.

Trading below 80% of NCAV and ½ of tangible book value, while repurchasing shares, Morio Denki 6647 has a low downside with potential satisfactory return in my basket of Japanese net-nets.

Long Morio Denki 6647.

Railroads have been by far my worse performing investment. I predicted more industrial integration between US, Canada and Mexico and an increase in trade, but boy was I wrong. In addition, I think the economic landscape is shifting to less higher quality products and software, so the volume of goods transported might increase at a slower pace than it has in the last decade (think cars sales for example). Also Business to consumer has lower margins and higher costs.

Still railroads have their infrastructure in place, are clearly cashflow positive, and pay a small dividend every year and buy back a few shares every quarter, so I don’t think they will lose lots of money long term.

Honestly, I am not a fan of NCS reliance on coal (although this administration doesn’t hate the product), and I am a bit concerned of the additional debt taken over by UNP, as well as the 27% share dilution.

However, the management is unlikely to bankrupt such a profitable company, and I can only see advantages owning such a big chunk of US commercial rail long term, at least for shareholders with a massive time horizon.

Given the whole stock market bubble debate, I think the safe haven assets like precious metals are looking pretty attractive right now.

Sadly I don’t have 6 figures to start dabbling in the futures market but I found the SPDR Gold Trust ETF which looks a bit more in my price range. It’s currently trading at 352 with the last big rallies around the 300 mark at the start of the year. I was thinking of buying in at around 340 on an expiry of Jan 2027 (delta of 0.68). 

Obviously I know there is risk with this play but betting against the market is inherently risky and my position size is going to be relatively small compared to my capital (much less that 5%). I understand that it would be vulnerable to interest rate changes but I get the impression that the Fed are likely to hold these for the 3-6 months or only make minor tweaks (unless Trump manages to sack them all).

1nu7d38,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 04:05:43,Thoughts on Boyd Gaming (the other BYD),"Literally has all the good things you want to see in a company.

- Year over year growth in revenue and gross profit 
- Share buybacks over the last few years
- Margins like a tech company
- Valuation like Lululemon / Paypal

### So what do they do?

Boyd Gaming Corporation primarily operates casinos and gaming entertainment facilities. Their customers are largely local residents from the areas surrounding their properties, as well as tourists visiting those regions. Demographically, they attract a broad range of adults, with a focus on those who enjoy gaming, dining, and entertainment. The company's revenue comes mainly from gaming operations (slot machines and table games), followed by food and beverage sales, hotel stays, and other entertainment offerings.

So the revenue distribution is 70% casinos, 8% food & drinks, 5% hotel, 11% online gambling, and the rest is just random things like ATM concession, retail, convention, etc.

Midwest & South USA makes up 55%, Las Vegas strip 6%, Las Vegas locals 24%, and rest is online.

### What makes them different?

Boyd Gaming targets a specific customer segment: gaming enthusiasts with tighter budgets, primarily in regional markets, rather than competing directly with high-end resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. This allows them to dominate niche markets and cater to local preferences. So this makes them harder to displace and they are less centralized.

Loyalty programs create sticky customers. Furthermore, Boyd is strategically expanding its online gaming presence, which diversifies revenue streams and reaches a broader customer base.

### Why invest?

Consistently beats EPS and revenue estimates. Returns money to shareholders. Operational efficiency. Solid history of outperformance. Manageable debt. PE of 13ish.

### Where is the growth?

Expansion includes investments in property expansions and new developments, such as a casino resort in Norfolk, Virginia, scheduled for late 2027. And this is on top of digital expansion in gambling every year, 33.2% growth YoY in Q2.cAnd they sold their stake in fanduel and are using it to pay debt so expect less interest payments in the future.

I already have a large slug of my portfolio in cash/mmf (30% a la Buffett). 50% in a global ETF. 20% in US small caps (s&p600). 

As I continue to dripfeed more in and this bull run continues id really like to pivot my portfolio gradually into resilient stocks. Thus giving me even more dry powder to buy quality stocks at better prices when/if market turns. 

Right now it's easy to find quality, but they're all more than 25x forward earnings and im not keen to pay it. The trouble I'm finding is that the classic recommendations like Walmart are already really pricey... and I believe would also tumble during a correction/ crash. 

Are there any equities out there that i could park my money in to suit the following criteria:

1. 7%+ total return
2. Would not fall much (or at all) during a downturn. I'm thinking that probably requires a moderate or low forward pe

1ntyl2h,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 20:15:36,Nordson is Proving That Old Dogs Can Still Learn New Tricks,"**Actionable Insight:**

Nordson has been around over 70 years and quietly increasing their dividend for 61 of them. The company has built its moat and riches by exploiting the niches. The company earns a high ROIC and in the last 15 years has been quietly making acquisitive moves towards growth and diversifying away from cyclical industries. If this low beta company can continue to execute within guidance and realize their growth targets then current \~18x EV/EBITDA seems overly modest and could rerate closer to peer Graco at \~20x for a price target of $310

**Intro:**

When I think about whether a company is going to be a good investment a few things come to mind, but the very first thing is will this company be here in 10 years. That's what I like about Nordson, this company has been around for awhile and I would wager it will continue to be. This is not a moon shot company, its a quiet compounder that will continue to generate cash flow in the background.

However, unlike a typical bond proxy this behemoth of a company is still taking swings for the fences. And given its track record, when the company swings its worth paying attention too. With an average EBITDA of around 30% and a ROIC hovering above 12% growth is the best path for success. Thankfully for the investors, management agrees.

**A Little About Nordson:**

For decades the company has played the part of the quiet cyclical compounder. Founded in 1954 on airless spray patents, it built its reputation in Industrial Precision Solutions, the hidden workhorses of packaging and coatings. Anything but sexy, this company was quietly sealing cereal boxes, coating electronics, and adding polymers with microscopic accuracy.

By 2010, revenue topped $1 Billion. Soon after, Nordson expanded into the high growth segment of Medical & Fluid Solutions with acquisitions in medical tubing and connectors. Some years go by and the company diversifies further into Advanced Technology Solutions through electronics and semiconductor dispensing.

**The New CEO:**

In 2019 a bold new character enters the scene: CEO Sundaram ""Naga"" Nagarajan. What he brought with him: An Ascend strategy focusing on 6-8% growth, 10-12% EPS growth, and the operating discipline of the NBS Next Framework. The message was subtle but clear: Nordson wasnt just defending its crown, but its looking to expand.

Immediately Naga's tenure would be tested by fire. The Covid pandemic would soon take the world by surprise. Factories slowed, polymers slumped, supply chains buckled. Where others struggled, Nordson's armor -> 57% of revenue from consumables, held firm. Margins barely dipped, proving its aristocratic steadiness. Emboldened by the trial, the CEO dared to reach further.

**Semiconductors Anyone?**

Im August 2022 Nordson stunned its own playbook, paying $380M for CyberOptics, a semiconductor inspection firm just a tenth its size. The company paid 4x revenue and 20x EBITDA. For a conservative acquirer this was audacious. The bet: that ""dispense + inspect"" would give Nordson a seat at the semiconductor packaging table, where chiplets, AI, and EV batteries demand perfect precision. The trade off: Lower segment margines of 24% but a real taste of secular growth.

**Can you pass me the medical valves please?**

Then came Atrion in 2024. $800M for medical valves and fluid components. Boring, high-margin, indispensable. Hospitals don't cycle with GDP; aging populations and a growing demand for minimally invasive procedures keep demand steady. If CyberOptics was the growth swing, Atrion was the ballast. Together goodwill swelled from $1.8B to $2.8B but redefined Nordson's portfolio: semis for upside, medtech for stabilization.

**So why pick Nordson?**

Here's where the narrative sharpens. Nordson's peers: Graco, IDEX, Donaldson, ITW... all remain incrementalists. They bolt on adjacencies, protect margins, return cash. Solid, but unsurprising.  Nordson stands alone in deliberately trying to transform from ""mature aristocrat"" into a ""growth compounder."" This is the crux of the reason I believe Nordson should be trading a higher multiple relative to peers.

**The Big List of If's**

Today Nordson trades at \~17-18x EV/EBITDA. This places it pricier than IDEX and Donaldson (\~15x) but less than Graco (\~20x). If CyberOptics sustains double-digit growth, if Atrion proves its ballast, if NBS Next unlocks the promised 10-12% EPS growth, Nordson has a path to the peer high end: 19-20x, $275-310 pps. That leaves 15-25% upside, not from financial engineering but from a deliberate evolution.

**What I am worried about:**

This is a low beta play. Even in a bear case I am not overly concerned about drawdowns or whether or not this company will continue to pay dividends. In my estimation, a bear case leaves the largest cost being missed opportunity elsewhere.

Semiconductors are arguably near peak cycle and would whiplash anytime, or could continue to run for a few years. The global exposure of the company helps to diversify income streams, but it also subjects the investor to fx risks, And the company has taken on a lot of goodwill, any signs that the investments are not paying off and there is a real risk that will have to be written down and can negatively effect the earnings in the future. Even though to date in the companies 70+ years this has not happened, the past is not a reflection of future performance.

The company does have some defense against these risks. A strong balance sheet, strong cash flow, moderate leverage and a consumanbles-driven model give it protection peers envy.

**Bottom Line:**

Nordson has a very compelling narrative. Its not just a good company at a fair price. Its the only aristocrat in its class deliberately reaching for more. Risking reputation and margine comfort to earn growth optionality. It feels like a founder ran company. If it succeeds, investors wont just own a quiet compounder. Theyll own an aristocrat that has evolved.

I work as a scientist for a large US tech company where management tries to enforce AI. But literally nobody uses AI tools. Or should I say, nobody has become more productive with existing tools. It takes more time to correct codes generated than writing from scratch or leveraging existing codes. It does help here and there, but NOTHING disruptive. I save maybe 3h of work per week, and I am being super generous. Not even talking about the infinite revenue loop created between the main AI actors. Time reveals everything, and this is no exception.

Now, there have been several posts on '*where to invest today? what are your strong picks in a period of ATH?*' So writing here where I have invested a large portion of my value portfolio, waiting patiently that money flows back. 

  
Here it is: **US insurance providers**. I have USD 110k invested as of today. Why? PE lower than usual, high revenue growth and money likely rotated from the sector to stupid AI. I have collected the best ones (according to me) such that you do not have to. 

Criteria: low PE (and lower than usual), high and consistent revenue growth, profitable, growing or constant margins, continuous stock price increase with a decrease in the last year (so not ATH), large cap:

* Chubb
* PGR
* ACGL
* AJG (okay PE is does not match the criteria above, but it systematicall increases over time with performance, so still invested in)
* Optional: TRV
* UNH
* ELV

**High risk (not fitting the above criteria, but could go to the moon):**

* LMND
* ROOT

Cherry on the cake: such portfolio has outperformed the SP500 in the last decade while being less affected during downturn periods. Insurance is not going anywhere, it is a necessity that grows with demographics and increased frequency of large events. Sector has underperformed but money will come back.

How does the combined inflation of 30%+ in the past 10 years (and beyond, for that matter) find its way into company valuations when evaluating a given company?

For a given company; Google, Oracle, Nvidia, whatever when analysis is performed, whether it be discounted cash flows, assets vs. liab, etc. - when you come to a value all else equal, and 7% inflation for the prior year, would that company not start with a value of 107% of its prior year valuation? Is it standard practice to then multiply that by 1.07 to get estimated dollar value? As the company you are evaluating is an asset, that is being valued in a currency that is worth less than it was in a prior year.

I'm wondering about market capitalization of 2 very similar companies DoorDash vs Delivery Hero.

A couple of statistics

**DoorDash:**

*Market cap: 115 B USD*

*Revenue H1 2025: 6,3 B USD (22,8% Y/Y growth)*

*EBITA: 1,25 B USD*

*EBITA margin: 2,7%*

**Delivery Hero:**

*Market cap: 8,5 B USD*

*Revenue H1 2025:* 8,5 *B USD (24,2% Y/Y growth)*

*EBITA: 0,48 B USD*

*EBITA margin: 1,7%*

Both companies look quite similar and seem to be at a comparable stage of development. Delivery Hero is even growing slightly faster (24.2% vs. 22.8%), despite being the larger company.  
However, DoorDash’s market capitalization is 13.5 times higher. Is this mainly due to the difference in stock market listing, or am I missing something?

My mom retirement fund is 1.1m, she worked hard to make that money and now she's not sure what to do with it. Vast majority of the money came from real estate over 30 years. 

I am not an experienced investor, but I understand that  diversification helps and timing the market is almost impossible. So through meeting with CFPs and CFAs, doing my own research I have suggested the following: 

10% (~100k) in physical gold
25% (~250k) in flex GIC returning 5.8%
75% (~750k) in the equities (650k in diversified ETFs and 100k in individual stocks).

The basis for putting 35% outside the market is to protect her for at least 3-4 years of income in case the market crashes. She needs ~100k per year, she doesn't own a property and she helps my sister go through university.

My questions:
1. What do you think of the approach, any critiques? 
2. Where would you invest the 100k in individual stocks? I think rare earths will grow significantly in the US, and then some defensive positions like UNH and LULU (high cf, good pe compared to industry). 

Again, this is all based on my readings, talking to ""experts"" and my research.

1ntkuix,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 11:19:55,My thesis on Crocs $CROX,"1. They own the word ""Crocs"". Off-brands / knockouts / counterfeit have been common since day 1, but they're all referred to as ""Crocs"" (just like ""Band-Aid""). When someone wants to buy Crocs-like shoes, they'll go to Amazon and search ""Crocs"" and buy whatever come up, which will usually be real Crocs. This is why they maintain a very high gross margin selling a easy-to-make product.
2. Low capex and high ROE. They don't manufacture the shoes, they outsource from China and Vietnam. If necessary, they can easily switch to Mexico or India etc, because it's low tech. Again the moat is the name, not the tech.
3. After you buy the shoes, they always work well, the product is simple, no way to mess it up (have defects etc). For people who like those shoes, they know the last purchase worked well and the next purchase will work well again, so they keep buying more, maybe for a lifetime.
4. Share price dropped 30% in a day after last quarterly report, because they lowered the earning forecast due to ""uncertain tariff environment in the US"", but I think it's not an issue - it doesn't change the demand, and all competitors are equally affected. I think it's an opportunity to buy. Some insiders bought it too at that time.
5. They now have a 20 PE because last quarter there was a huge impairment of goodwill (they overpaid to acquire another brand which performed poorly) so GAAP earning were low. If you screen by PE, you won't find this stock, which I think is why nobody is buying the dip. But if you read the last quarterly report, their non-GAAP earnings was much higher, the real PE is less than 7.
6. I personally observed that some kids nowadays call slides ""Crocs"" too, maybe because they grew up in a household where the parents wear Crocs indoors and don't wear slides, and they call them Crocs, so the kid grew up thinking all indoor shoes are called Crocs.

1ntkqwp,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 11:16:00,European small cap gem ?,"Hello everyone,

I'm in the process of rebuilding my Small-Cap portfolio (it's a portfolio that benefits from a tax advantage), and I absolutely don't know what to take. In fact, I had bet quite a lot on a company that just crashed on the stock market due to excellent results that weren't enough for the investors, and all that with a nice capital increase that represents more than 12% of the capital.

The main issue is no etf is available. There are some available ""fund"" for this type of portfolio, but they can't beat the market, and much worse ...

I did have my watchlist, but once again I missed everything: Theon International and Fincantieri have exploded because coincidentally the defense sector is rising again (similar to Hensoldt...). I had AVIO, but because I wanted to make an effort for a rigorous analysis, I sold it, and the stock naturally took off (24 hours after the sale, while the stock was stuck at 32 Euros despite good news).

Today I'm trying to find good Small Caps in full momentum again, but I find absolutely nothing. Unfortunately, the German market doesn't fit into the portfolio because it's outside of Euronext. So I have to find some on the stock markets: **French, Dutch, Irish, Belgian, Italian, and Norwegian...**

1ntjrmr,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 10:38:46,Canadian National Railway(CNI): A Buffett-Style Compounder hiding in plain Sight?,"So, before we get into this. I analyse businesses for a living, What I post is not necessarily stocks related...But great businesses that will fundamentally will make you good bucks in the stock market  
Keep in mind...it's not a stock advice:

When great long term compounders are mentioned, railroads do not come to mind for many people. Warren Buffett famously bought Burlington Northern (BNSF), calling it an ""all-in wager on the economic future of the United States"". If you dig in the space, Canadian National Railway (CNI) is possibly the most ignored example today.

\-Why Are Railroads Great Businesses?

\-Natural monopolies: The capital cost, regulation, and land rights needed to replicate a rail network almost makes it impossible for more players to enter. Rail roads are almost by design oligopolies.  
\-Pricing power and efficiency: Rail is the cheapest and most energy efficient mode of transport for freight over long distances. This will keep them viable businesses even if we live in a world that is obsessed with tech.  
\-Inflation hedge: Many contracts have fuel surcharges and inflation pass through, this protects margins for decades.

Why CNI?  
Canadian National is unique: with a single rail line, it has more reach than any North American railroad - Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. The geographic footprint generates strategic advantages that no other Class I railroads can duplicate.

\-Diversified freight mix: Grain, petroleum, intermodal, forestry products, nothing particular dominates revenue.  
\-Operating discipline: CNI is widely regarded as one of the most efficient operators in the industry, with industry-leading operating ratios.  
\-Cross-border trade exposure: As U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade flows increase, CNI sits in a structurally advantaged position.

Capital Allocation & Durability

\-Strong free cash flow that supports dividends+buybacks without jeopardizing reinvestment.  
\-Enormous reinvestment moat: every dollar spent on track upgrades, locomotives, and technology widens the gap competitors would need billions to close.  
\-Net Revenue hitting- 4,272M which is a bit higher side for this industry.  
\-Long runway: freight rail is not going away;it remains a backbone of continental logistics.

I am an Analyst but will refrain from commenting on the stock price. Tho, I am bullish on the company I'll just wait for it's quarterly earning report dropping on 31st October. Will check out [PineGap.ai](http://PineGap.ai) for consensus and earnings report summary and take decisions on the same.

1ntj1b7,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 10:10:00,Autonomous Vehicle Industry Deep Dive: Is Regulatory Compliance the Core Moat?,"I'm focused less on specific AV companies and more on where the durable long-term value will emerge in the robotaxi industry. This sector involves high R&D and requires capital, but the overall market opportunity is large, potentially reaching tens of billions of dollars by 2030.

Currently, the central competitive advantage isn't just the core technology (which often relies on shared platforms like NVIDIA) but regulatory compliance and geographic scale.

The Thesis: The most defensible moat over the next five years will belong to the companies that successfully secure Level 4 permits across varied global jurisdictions (e.g., the US, China, and the Middle East). Why? Because there's a system (weride) validated and approved by transportation authorities in distinct regulatory environments has a significant advantage over a single-market operator. Gaining these approvals requires substantial resource commitment, which functions as a strong barrier to entry.

This perspective suggests that when evaluating these companies, we should prioritize two key intangible assets: regulatory asset accumulation and geographic first-mover status, as these will underpin future business operations.

1ntimc1,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 09:53:06,"Deckers (DECK): 52% Drop, 104% Upside? A DCF Case Study","Deckers (DECK) has fallen 52% from its January 2025 high of $223.98 to $105.77, even though the company just reported record revenue and earnings. The market seems focused on tariff risks, weaker guidance, and slowing growth in both UGG and Hoka, which made it an interesting test case for a disciplined DCF analysis.

Data from our platform, using analyst consensus forecasts, points to an initial 12.4% growth rate derived through weighted regression across estimates. Growth is then tapered gradually to 3% over a ten-year horizon, which avoids the unrealistic cliff effect of traditional two-stage models. The model applies a 22.3% EBITDA margin, consistent with DECK’s historical efficiency and pricing power. For the discount rate, it incorporates Damodaran’s methodology, starting with an unlevered industry beta and relevering it for DECK’s capital structure. This results in a WACC of 7.2%, reflecting current market risk premiums.

On those assumptions, the model generated $31.3 billion in enterprise value, with 71% coming from terminal value and the rest from projected cash flows. After adjusting for net cash, that translated to an equity value of $32.9 billion, or $215.8 per share. Compared with the current price, the implied upside is about 104%. Sensitivity testing shows that even with more conservative 8% growth assumptions, the upside remains around 66%. On the other hand, raising the discount rate above 10% would nearly erase the gap, which shows how sensitive the valuation is to risk assumptions.

The analysis highlights both the opportunity and the limitations of DCF. On one hand, the market seems to be pricing DECK at barely half of what a consensus-driven model suggests. On the other hand, more than 70% of the value comes from terminal assumptions, which leaves a lot riding on long-term execution and competitive dynamics. Add in the uncertainties of tariffs and geopolitics, and it’s easy to see why sentiment has pushed the stock down.

DCF suggests the market may be underpricing DECK’s fundamentals, but the result rests on assumptions about long-term growth durability and risk premiums. To me, it’s less a “back up the truck” case and more an example of how sentiment-driven dislocations can create opportunities if you’re comfortable with the embedded risks.

Would be interested to hear how others in this community would approach DECK. Does it look like an attractive value setup, or a potential trap disguised by optimistic assumptions?

1ntah2s,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 02:07:00,Environmentally friendly Bitcoin miner pivoting towards data centre infrastructure - TeraWulf Inc.,"What happens when one of the greenest Bitcoin miners also becomes a data center player? You get TeraWulf—a company tapping into nuclear and hydro power to mine Bitcoin while simultaneously scaling the infrastructure needed for the AI and cloud economy. It’s a dual strategy that could give them an edge in two of the fastest-growing industries on the planet.

Settle in—this is where I break down exactly what TeraWulf is doing and why it matters. The way TeraWulf is positioning itself might surprise you.

As always, this is not financial advice, just a way for me to kill time lol.

The first rule of investing in any company is simple: know what they do and how they make money for shareholders.

# Overview

TeraWulf operates as an owner and operator of vertically integrated, industrial-scale digital infrastructure across the United States. The core strategy emphasizes environmentally sustainable operations, utilizing predominantly zero-carbon energy sources. This vertical integration, coupled with management’s deep expertise in the energy infrastructure sector—spanning decades in development, ownership, and operation of large-scale energy assets —provides a foundational competitive advantage in securing and delivering reliable, compliant power to highly demanding computation clients. The business model is rapidly evolving from a singular focus on proprietary computing (Bitcoin mining) to a dual-segment approach, incorporating high-margin, long-term hosting.

# Segment A: Bitcoin Self-Mining

This segment is defined by high volume and high volatility. As of December 2024, WULF achieved 9.7 EH/s of installed self-mining capacity, representing a significant 94.0% year-over-year increase. This scale exposes WULF directly to Bitcoin price fluctuations and network difficulty adjustments, reinforcing the stock’s high historical volatility (Beta 4.18).

Operationally, the self-mining segment faces structural cost challenges. In December 2024, the average power cost was approximately $0.078/kWh, leading to a high average power cost of $62,805 per bitcoin mined (excluding credits from demand response). This cost structure is considerably higher than that of peers who rely on subsidized or less sustainable power sources (as detailed . The premium paid for sustainable energy is not an operational flaw if it is the enabling factor for the high-margin HPC business. The mining segment essentially functions as the anchor load and operational proof-of-concept for the green energy infrastructure, allowing the company to charge a premium in the high-value contracted segment, which ultimately outweighs the higher energy cost in the mining segment.

# Segment B: HPC Hosting

This segment represents the future of WULF’s business, it involves leveraging the company’s vertically integrated infrastructure to provide compute-ready data center space for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI clients.

The quality of revenue is exceptionally high due to recent contract wins:

1. **Core42:** Secured for over 70 MW of digital infrastructure, representing total revenue exceeding $1 billion over an initial 10-year term.
2. **Fluidstack/Google:** Anchor agreements for 360+ MW of critical IT load, representing approximately $6.7 billion in contracted revenue over the initial 10-year term.

The lease with Fluidstack is expected to bring in over $670 million a year in revenue with site level net operating margins of roughly 85%. Importantly, Google is providing a $3.2 billion backstop for FluidStacks lease obligations in exchange for warrants representing about 14% of WULF’s equity, an extraordinary vote of confidence from one of the most influential players in AI.

Secondly, they brought in Cayuga. They executed an 80 year ground lease with a purchase option, securing exclusive rights to develop up to 400 MWs of digital infrastructure on a fully equipped site with high capacity transmission, industrial water intake and redundant fiber. It is expected to bring more than 130 megawatts online in 2027 with substantial expansion potential beyond that.

Together, these transactions increase the total platform capacity to over 1 GW, firmly positioning Lake Mariner and Cayuga as cornerstone assets for the future of AI infrastructure.

# BTC Mining Market Dynamics

The legacy cryptocurrency mining equipment market remains relatively small, valued at $4.89 billion in 2024, with a modest expected CAGR of 6% through 2029. This limited total addressable market confirms that WULF’s future valuation cannot be sustained or driven by the mining segment alone. Furthermore, the high power cost structure ($0.078/kWh) exacerbates the sensitivity of WULF’s self-mining operations to post-Halving reductions in block rewards and transaction fee volatility. To maintain viability in this segment, WULF must rely on continuous operational efficiency improvements, such as its currently superior fleet efficiency of 19.2 J/TH.

WULF’s positioning requires a nuanced competitive comparison, as it no longer competes solely against pure-play miners. In the mining segment, WULF is structurally disadvantaged on cost when compared to peers who operate in markets with highly subsidized power or robust demand response programs.

While peers like Riot Platforms focus on maximizing scale and energy credits in deregulated markets (achieving a low all-in power cost of 2.8c/kWh ), WULF’s focus is on vertical integration and securing premium HPC contracts. This strategic dichotomy provides WULF with a valuable competitive exit strategy: as HPC capacity expands (200+ MW by YE 2026) , the company can strategically phase out its lower-margin self-mining IT load, replacing volatile commodity revenue with high-margin contracted infrastructure revenue.

# HPC and AI Infrastructure Market

The demand trajectory for HPC and AI infrastructure is vastly steeper than that of the legacy cryptocurrency mining market. WULF’s commitment to sustainable, zero-carbon energy serves as a critical competitive differentiator, allowing them to capture the “Green Premium” required by hyperscale clients seeking to meet stringent ESG and compliance mandates.

The Google-backed Fluidstack transaction provides definitive external validation of WULF’s infrastructure quality. Google, as a hyper-scale cloud provider known for rigorous technical and financial due diligence, backstopping $3.2 billion of Fluidstack’s lease obligations is a powerful endorsement. This commitment confirms that WULF possesses the necessary engineering expertise and reliable power infrastructure to support the complex, demanding compute environment required for cutting-edge AI computation, justifying the targeted 85% NOI margins.

# Moat Durability Assessment

**Moat Component:** Vertical Integration & Energy Expertise

**Assessment:** Durable

**Rationale:** Management’s deep expertise in energy infrastructure allows WULF to design and build bespoke power assets ($8M-$10M/MW CAPEX) that pure-play miners or generic data center operators cannot easily replicate.

**Moat Component:** Contracted Cash Flow Quality

**Assessment:** Highly Durable

**Rationale:** Long-term, non-cancellable 10-year contracts with annual escalators provide predictable, high-margin revenue, insulating WULF from commodity volatility. The Google backstop adds superior credit quality to this revenue stream.

**Moat Component:** Location and Power Sourcing

**Assessment:** Moderate

**Rationale:** Securing rights to low-cost, zero-carbon power in key industrial locations like Lake Mariner (NY) is geographically restricted and acts as a significant barrier to entry once established.

# Growth Analysis

The foundation of future growth is the certainty provided by the contracted revenue. The $6.7 billion commitment over 10 years offers revenue visibility unparalleled among cryptocurrency mining peers. This annuity stream, backed by the credit quality of a hyperscale partner, is projected to yield approximately $570 million in annual Site NOI at the 85% margin target once the 360+ MW is fully online (expected year-end 2026).

The growth trajectory is dictated by three primary levers:

1. **HPC Deployment Acceleration (Primary Lever):** The successful and timely completion of the 360+ MW buildout by year-end 2026 is paramount. Success in meeting this ambitious timeline ensures immediate realization of the 85% NOI margin and justifies the transition to a higher infrastructure valuation multiple.
2. **Expansion Optionality (CB-5):** Fluidstack’s exclusivity on an additional 160 MW at Lake Mariner represents a significant, low-risk growth path. This opportunity converts physical site infrastructure and utility access rights into high-margin capacity without the immediate burden of high-cost land or site development. Monetizing this growth inventory would nearly double the company’s core contracted MW capacity.
3. **Optimization of BTC Mining Operations (Secondary Lever):** Continuous optimization efforts to reduce the currently high effective power cost ($0.078/kWh) —potentially through more favorable Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) or enhanced demand response participation—would increase cash flow in the secondary segment, providing residual liquidity for maintenance CAPEX or accelerated debt service.

# Risk Analysis

WULF remains susceptible to external financial shocks. The stock’s high historical Beta of 4.18 means market sentiment remains heavily influenced by Bitcoin price volatility until the contracted revenue fully dominates the financial profile (post-2027). Although the Google backstop secures the majority of the HPC financing, WULF must still access the capital markets to fund residual CAPEX, working capital, and potential future expansion capacity beyond the current contracts. Macroeconomic risks, including interest rate fluctuations and general regulatory changes in the digital asset space, persist.

The single most significant threat to the acquisition value is execution failure. The requirement to deploy $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion in CAPEX and bring 360+ MW online by year-end 2026 represents an aggressive operational timeline. Delays or significant cost overruns could breach contractual obligations and severely erode the projected 85% NOI margin. Furthermore, sourcing specialized components for HPC infrastructure at this scale introduces supply chain and logistical risks, although management’s energy infrastructure track record provides substantial mitigation.

It must be noted that while the initial debt load will be high the highly predictable $570 million in annual NOI ensures an exceptionally rapid de-leveraging timeline. This characteristic fundamentally lowers the credit risk associated with the high capital investment, making the resultant capital structure considerably safer than traditional Bitcoin mining debt.

# Financials

In the 2025, WULF self mined 485 Bitcoin at Lake Mariner or approximately 5 Bitcoin per day, a 30% increase over the 372 Bitcoin mined in Q1 2025. TheirGAAP revenues were up 38% quarter over quarter at $47.6 million in Q2 2025 from $34.4 million in Q1 2025. Meanwhile their GAAP cost of revenue exclusive of depreciation decreased by 10% from $24.5 million in Q1 2025 to $22.1 million in Q2 2025.

Power prices in Upstate New York normalized in Q2 2025 and they expect pricing to remain in line with historical levels for the rest of 2025 guiding at $0.05 per kilowatt hour for second half of the year. SG&A expense for Q2 2025 was $14.3 million after adjusting for stock based compensation SG&A decreased QoQ from $11.5 million in Q1 2025 to $10.7 million in Q2 2025. Their non GAAP adjusted EBITDA showed significant improvement in Q2 2025 totaling $14.5 million up from a negative $4.7 million in Q1 2025. As a reminder, these results are inclusive of significant increases in SG&A and operating expenses over the past twelve months as they invested heavily in the HPC business. These incremental costs have been entirely borne by the mining business until now.

WULF is on track for the Wolf Den and CB1 leases with Core42 to start generating revenue in Q3 2025. They remain on schedule and on budget for the delivery of this capacity. Looking ahead to the 2025, they’ve updated their guidance in on the investor presentations. At current BTC prices and network hash rate, they expect the mining operations to contribute positively to EBITDA in the second half of the year. They’ve also slightly adjusted the annual SG&A guidance to $50 - $55 million from $40 - $45 million reflecting the accelerated growth in theHPC business.

WULF is planning to raise $3 billion in debt for the expansion of its’ AI infrastructure. The CEO is working with Morgan Stanley to arrange the funding. This could be launched as early as next month thorugh high yield bonds or leveraged loans.",0,0,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ntah2s/environmentally_friendly_bitcoin_miner_pivoting/,new,Stock Analysis,0.25

1nt1y65,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 18:43:21,CATERPILLAR [Post 2/4],"*This is the second post of a serie of at least 4 posts on mining/construction equipment. The first post was on* [*Epiroc*](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ni0qk3/epiroc_swedish_mining_equipment_serial_acquirer/) 

Caterpillar is a manufacturer of mining equipment, construction equipment, gaz turbines and marine & rail equipment. It was founded in 1925.

  
The company sales are geographically diversified, eventhough the majority of them are made in north america.

**Asset Allocation**

In average the company distributes 35% of its earnings as dividends. 

In the last 6 years, the company used close to 60% of its earnings in net buybacks. The reduction of outstanging shares was about 3% per year during that period.

The equity ratio is about 20% in average.

The company made acquisitions over the years. Most of the acquisitions are now made in the Energy & Transportation Group. 

\* They bought lots of add-ons to their Rail Division (Progress Rail), originally bought in 2006.

\* They bought gaz-engine manufacturer MVM in 2011 for 774 M$

\* One add-on for Solar Turbines in 2015.



The last acquisitions outside that group are :

\* Bucyrus for 8.8 B$ in 2011. Most of the distribution businesses for Bucyrus have been resold to existing Caterpillar distributor in 2012-2014 for a total of more than 2 B$.

\* one Japanese distributor for 200 M$ in 2012

\* one chinese company bought for 677 M$ in 2012. The next year, they depreciated 580 M$ of goodwill, because of fake accounting numbers produced before the acquisitions !?! They signed a deal to get 135 M$ back from the guilty parties

  
**Shareholders, Management & Board**

The company doesn't have main shareholders.

The new CEO Joe Creed was named in may 2025, but has been in the group since 1997. He was named CFO of the largest group (Energy & Transportation) in 2013. He then managed the financial services division in addition to interim CFO of Caterpillar. He then managed two divisions of the Energy & Transportation Group. He was named group president of Energy & Transportation in 2021, then COO (as in : successor of the CEO) in 2023. 

Ex-CEO Jim Umleby (17-25) stayed as chairman. 

Jason Kaiser, successor as group president of Energy & Transportation has been in the group since 2000. 

Bob de Lange, group president Digital, Technology & Distribution has been in his position since 2018 and joined Caterpillar in 1993.

Toni Fassino, group president Construction Industries has been named in 2021, but joined the group in 1996. He was previously head of the Building Construction Products Division (part of the Construction Industries group) from 2018.

Denise Johnson has been named group president of Ressources industries in 2016. She works for Caterpillar since 2011.

Generally speaking, there is some continuity in the management and the board. I see it as a green flag.



**Some numbers**

The profitability is going up, but have been low sometimes. The company made losses in 2016. Then the profitability was : 1.66% (17), 11.23% (18), 11.33% (19), 7.18% (20%), 12.73% (21), 11.28% (22), 15.41% (23), 16.65% (24). 

We can see that the company is quite cyclical. They don't seem to have as much recurring revenues as Epiroc.

The problem is that the company is generating sales and revenues of financial products that are only equivalent to about 70% of their balance sheet. They don't make a lot of money on the total assets, except in 2023-2024. One small factor might be that their rental activities includes a lot of equipment that is not from the group, including for example compressors from Atlas Copco. Usually, owning equipment to rent is a bad business, especially if it is not your products.  


**Conclusion**

The company has definitely not been exceptionally good before 2023, especially if you compare with Epiroc. I would not buy it, unless they were able to keep their numbers as good as 2023-2024, which I doubt they can. Their high level of buybacks could destroy value rapidly if the price was more expensive. Behind this high level of dividend and buybacks hides a limited capacity to make acquisitions.",6,1,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nt1y65/caterpillar_post_24/,new,Stock Analysis,1.0

Quantitative memos such as the P/E and P/B ratios, and of course, the DCF related to the intrinsic value, I like to have three different sets of growth, from a bear, to moderate, to a bull.

Recently I’ve gotten interested to create a saas (software as a service) business because I can’t turn 1k into 1 million dollars investing, the only way I can is through creating a business. I would really appreciate it if you guys would comment some pain points that I could possibly build a software to solve for.

I got an idea to create an intrinsic value editor that allows users to calculate the fair value of a company’s stock by entering key inputs such as free cash flow, growth rate, and discount rate as well as many metrics from the financial statements. The editor automatically applies the intrinsic value formula and displays the results in real time. You can also set up if statements within the tool, for example, “if the intrinsic value is higher than the current market price, display a message that the stock is undervalued.” In addition, you can configure alerts so that when certain conditions are met — like a stock becoming 20% undervalued — the tool notifies you instantly. This makes the editor not only a calculator, but also a decision-support system for smarter investing.

Also I was thinking about creating a software with AI included but I’m not sure which pain points it would solve.

Sometimes of course this is true. Bad management, stupid ideas, and new management can fix it.

But it's also the case that a company could have once been great because of luck, factors out of their control, how the world was in that time that it allowed them to thrive.

For example: Disney. Disney got big by being THE company for family entertainment. In an era when making movies had a high cost barrier to entry. When publicity depended on being connected to media, rather than word of mouth. As movie technology was constantly changing. And those things no longer exist. Might Disney return? Maybe, but you can't assume an automatic spring back because the world that made them a titan no longer exists.

Or Intel. This is constantly mentioned on here, but everyone seems to forget they got huge because IBM picked them for their PC and when that opened up and we got Dell and HP clones, they all used an Intel chip. You wanted Windows, you had to go Intel. Gradually, PCs have flattened in terms of sales, ARM won the phone market and it growing into other areas like Macs, servers and Windows on ARM. Then there's RISC-V in China to consider. The US government scaring China about getting chips led to them investing more in their own technology.

None of this is to say there isn't a way back, but ""was big"" can cloud your judgement. Understanding why they are now smaller is really important.",7,4,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nso3s7/make_company_great_again/,new,Stock Analysis,1.0

This must be your first question. Too often, also in this subreddit, I see recommendations of highly valued trending stocks. Especially for tech businesses, it is unpredictable what the future will bring.

Therefore, I would like to share some less popular stocks that you also might consider as a long term investor:

* Azelis Group (AZE), a Belgian company. A serial acquirer of companies in special chemicals distribution. In my opinion, highly undervalued.
* FastNed BV (FAST), a Dutch charging station company. This relative new company is still cash flow negative, but the potential is huge. I like their story. Probably in two or three years cash flow positive.
* Fugro (FUR), geotechnical and geoscience services. This company had a lot of headwinds in 2025 due to cancelled oil/gas/wind projects. The investor sentiment is at it lowest... Still, their balance sheet looks ok. And long term, I think these projects will still continue. Now it is Trump in the white house, but one way or the other, the global energy transition (from oil to renewable energy) is going to happen.

1. Company layoffs early 2024 followed shortly by a revenue miss in Q1
2. Quarterly growth isn't as high as it used to be
3. Ai growth hasn't been as quick as expected
4. Skeptiscim about how ai will neagtively impact the business
5. The lower future growth output is causing PE contraction 

>***Salesforce growth catalyst***

1. Financial metrics are increasing to ATH (net/gross margins, FCF/Share, EBITA)
2. The revenue growth was from acquisition (not organic high margin growth), so a slow down in revenue from no further acquisitions make sense
3. Ratios are at near ATL (P/S, P/E, P/FCF)
4. Massive investment into AI development . Suggested 120% YoY growth in Data Cloud + AI ARR. the company said that over 40% of Data Cloud and Agentforce Q2 bookings came from existing customer expansion. This suggests that customers are finding significant value in the company’s AI and data offering and are willing to deepen their relationships with the company.
5. Q2 2025 announced a further $20B in share buy backs, brining the total to $50B of authorized share buy backs. Close to 1/4 of the companies mark cap in buybacks alone
6. On [help.salesforce.com](http://help.salesforce.com), Agentforce handled 380,000 conversations with 84% resolution; only \~2% required human escalation.

>***Bringing it together*** 

Salesforce is growing revenues at a modest rate of 8-9% net profit margins have increased 12% YoY, implying the business is becoming more efficient. 

Operating cash flow is growing at 12-13% YoY Full year guidance indicate EPS beats from $11.31 to $11.37 This net margin growth is expected to stay in double digits as Agentforce continues to rapidly grow in the next 2-3 years, growing the companies operating margins from 33% to 35/38% range. 

The business data suggests the moat is strong and growth is in line with markets, however the company is becoming more efficient increasing net cash/fcf positions With these extra profits, the company is doing mass buybacks Despite this, the P/S, P/E, P/FCF are near all time lows, dragging the stock price from of a high of $369 to $243.43 

*The markets seem to be looking through the wrong lens when approaching a thesis on salesforce.*

1nsinid,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 03:59:44,Is Intel making a mistake?,"Full disclosure I have been interested in intel stock for a couple months now. Ever since the government took a 10% share in intel. I have been planning to invest 25k into the company but have not been liquid enough to do it just yet. 

I think intel despite its failings has a genuinely strong thesis. It’s the best US based foundry capable of producing microchips. With Chinas looming attack of Taiwan it is imperative for the U.S to have an answer for microchip production. China doesn’t have to actually take Taiwan to disable chip production , the process of making chips is so fragile that airburst from artillery could disrupt it. Microchips are core to Americas military , if TSMC is disabled we would see American military strength significantly weaken due to our weapons becoming difficult to replace and rearm. Intels success is literally a matter of national security.

That being said Intel currently is a gutted company on the verge of collapse with only a few small signs of hope such as the NVDA investment.

All of this being said I am not currently comfortable investing in Intel. Intel has seen a major increase in share price over the last couple weeks at a rate that seems detached from reality. Yes it has seen some minor wins but most of the gains are based on hype. “Intel in talks with TSMC” type of thing that doesn’t speak to the companies fundamentals. More so the stock has become a pseudo meme stock. 

I think this could be detrimental to the stock in the long run. If Intel stock keeps running up based on hype I think we will see a major retraction in the price in correlation with a market event. This type of fall will stunt intel’s long term growth due to investor fear of a repeat. Maybe even killing the company in the process. 

The question that I have is does my analysis make sense? I am still on the fence about investing in the company right now. I want to know if I should wait for the market correction or invest asap.

1nshls6,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 02:52:33,Freeport McMoRan Accident and Valuation,"Last week Freeport stock dropped more than 20% due to an accident in their Grasberg mine in indonesia. While I do understand the implications (2026,2027 lower production) are negative for the company, I don’t see why the stock dropped by so much. 

1) Usually mining (and oil) companies are valued with respect to their reserves and their cost to produce these reserves. So something like Reserves x (Commodity selling Price - Break Even Commodity Price). The accident at their mine will not change their reserves there. Of course there will be some extra costs which can be reflected in the Break Even Commodity Price of the Company (it will be increased), but I cannot believe it to be so high, that it justifies the drop we saw last week.

2) Copper Markets. No matter which source you take (BHP report, IEA Report), until 2050 there will be a massive undersupply of copper. The main reasons are declining ore head grades, almost no new discoveries and new permissions for mines takes ages (e.g. Resolution Copper for Rio and BHP is now more than 25 years in the permitting process). So if there is some supply demand imbalance here, prices are likely to rise (gold-copper-ratio also suggest that but it is not based on fundamentals). This is now somewhat of a paradoxon. When Freeport cannot pull out their copper out of the ground now, but only later when prices are (imo) much higher, and then Freeport has even higher ore Grades in 2-3 years, they make much more money than, than they lose know (OK, I do understand that there is uncertainty about that and you need to discount the future and such, but this is like a 20% risk discount which I think is irrational).

3)According to Goldman Analyst (I think it was them, but I could be wrong), due to this accident the copper supply decreased by 3% and now the world switched for a surplus to a deficit of copper. In the Barrons article it was written, that the same absolut amount of dollar which were lost in freeports market cap were gained in the market caps of BHP Rio and Glencore (because they are the largest copper producers) and will gain market share. Now, when in 2-3 years this mine comes online again with its 3% worldwide production rate (assuming everything else stays the same, I don’t think there will be more copper so the market share will be at least 3%, most likely more, see 1)). This market cap switch should be reversed, so Freeport will gain the market share it lost again.

Possible returns: 

While mining is not the classical Buffett and Munger play, I do think this is a value opportunity with a great entry point now. Copper is finite and demand will outstrip supply in the coming decades. After a drop of 20%, you will need a gain of 25%, so just waiting for Freeport to make their mine run again in the next 3 years, will give you 25% return over a period of 3 years. 

Of course I looked much more deeply in their annual reports and such but I don’t think it is relevant for this investment case. I will just say, they have 23 million ounces of gold at 1600$, and 97 billion pounds of copper at 3.25$/lb. So just looking at market prices of copper and gold right now, and making the math I described in 1), gives you the long term outlook. 

Looking forward to a discussion.

1nsfi0z,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 00:44:16,Why CSU (Constellation Software) is not a buy.,"Hey all,

I am aware of the buzz around the significant drop in CSU's stock price following the management transition from Mark Leonard to Mark Miller. While I find the market's overreaction silly, it is nothing unexpected, i am assuming the same will happen when Buffett steps down as well.

I believe the drop has been around 12 - 17% following the news. That is not a great margin of safety for a rational value investor. Also, looking at the FCF PE is still inflated, to say the least. Moreover, the actual P/E ratio is useless because they throw away so much more cash than they earn. Hence, the cash flow statement is crucial for such asset-heavy companies.

Overall i being someone who has read years of leanoards letters to shareholders, is sad to see him go, and i am sure managament that will assume roles will do fine, i do not think there is a serious margin of safety to buy, because price is a crucial factor, the underlying business is fine, but is not great, and considerng the heavy reliance on management's ability to allocate capital, unless the margin of safety is between 30 - 40%, i just cannot justify a buy.

Thanks.

Just wanted to add when I was referring to the margin of safety i meant the intrinsic value based of future earning powers while i belive most people are buying because of the 20 percent drop following the news.

1nsd54h,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 22:36:03,One of the best performing tech stocks of all time is on sale. And it’s not the Mag 7. Or even in the US.,"Constellation Software ($CSU.TO / $CNSWF) is experiencing a rare drawdown, in fact, the largest drawdown since IPO back in 2006. The founder, Mark Leonard, has been known as Canadas Warren Buffet, and is touted as one of the greatest capital allocators of all time. His shareholder letters are of renowned status, and anyone who has done any amount of research into the company knows the management quality is unparalleled. 

Constellation Software's compounding returns have quietly outshone almost every other stock since its IPO, cementing its place as one of the all-time great performers, all without being a member of the ""Magnificent Seven."" The company's unique, decentralized, long-term acquisition strategy for mission-critical vertical market software has created a fortress of recurring revenue. The services provided are known by shareholders to be sticky and switching costs are high. The company maintains relationships with potential acquisitions and holds a record of over 50,000 companies to potentially acquire. Since IPO, only one company has ever been re-sold, and Mark Leonard says this was one of his biggest regrets. 

I believe recent drawdown is entirely overblown. Skepticism over the impact of AI on its vast portfolio neglects Constellation's deep, embedded and entrenched specialized knowledge and systems in niche customer workflows—an enduring advantage against generalized AI tools. Furthermore, the stock's plunge following founder Mark Leonard's resignation for health reasons, though understandable given his legendary status, discounts the company's established, deep management bench and decentralized acquisition structure, which was built for perpetual operation beyond any single individual. The long-term thesis remains firmly intact. Mark Miller, the new CEO, himself has over 30 years with the company, leaving little doubt to his performance capabilities. 

The company typically commands a high premium, usually at 35-40x forward FCF. However, with last weeks intense sell off, the 2026E FCF multiple is currently in the low to mid 20s. I think this presents a very compelling opportunity for a company that has historically compounded at 20-30%. 

I believe this is a very rare buying opportunity. Next week, Constellation is holding a meeting to discuss the recent resignation of Mark Leonard. Volatility will likely remain high. I currently own 52 shares and will consider adding more in this dip.


**EDIT:**

Added below is one of the comments I made regarding what I believe is the root issue with the AI bear thesis - 

This is where the core issue of the AI arguement is: VMS will only lose value if they lose their customers.

I'm highly doubtful that artificial intelligence, any time in the near future, will upend and displace niche mission critical vertical market softwares. Typically, the cost of these vertical market softwares as a proportion of revenue generated from the business is one percent or less. There's no way that a municipality, utility, government agency or a healthcare facility (all common customers of CSU) will suddenly want to exchange deeply embedded VMS software for a new random vibe coded artificial intelligence mess, which will be riddled with bugs, issues, errors and inefficienceis. CSU's softwares have over the years been custom tailored and designed for each specific industry and business. Further, while AI has been shown to be decent at generating new code for simple programs, it's quite bad at debugging and fixing issues and errors. Like one commentor put it, good for greenfield, bad for brownfield. 

Imagine having to retrain hundreds of employees on how to use a new software that's been used by the business for the last fifteen to twenty years. Then fix all the new bugs, issues and inefficiencies on top of that. And remember when I said, the expense for this software is <1% of their revenue? Are they going to go through this headache? No.

Real world example - I work as a physical therapist with a home health agency. We still use a software on our company mobile devices called ""HomeCare HomeBase"" that was made for Blackberries with a keyboard and stylus for use by nurses 15 years ago. We still use it today and it's still one of the largest home health softwares used by home health agencies in the US. It's the same concept. For these businesses, switching out the software is just not worth the disruption in business operations for at best a minor operational efficiency improvement and practially no cost savings.

1ns6vo5,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 17:28:52,A few words on the mining industry: valuing companies should be done differently.,"I think there is a core crowd here who do value investing the old fashioned way. We determine a cohort of companies, try to place a value each of them using a minimum number of assumptions, and try to identify outliers that are trading far below fair value AND have a robust future in terms of earnings forecast.

I personally work in the minerals exploration industry and spend most of my time evaluating projects there (geologically) but once in a while I do make investment decisions. I don't think I beat the market by a significant margin. But it struck me a few weeks ago that the approach I take is totally different from the normal companies on the stock market so I share it here with the aim of getting feedback.

So target cohort I'll cover here are pre-discover exploration companies. Also called ""Juniors"". They are looking for metals in various parts of the world but have effectively no assets and are pre-revenue. Somewhat comparable to startups in the tech space. But given it takes many years to develop a mine, they are likely 20+ years away from revenue because they haven't even found any metal. This is where most investors encounter the minerals industry.

Valuation at this stage relies less on financial models and more on comparables and ""optionality"" (what could they do in the near future). We look at the cost per square kilometre of land held under exploration license, or the enterprise value relative to metres drilled, as a way to anchor expectations. Others attempt a probability-weighted “real option” approach, where you assign a very small chance of discovery leading to eventual production. But in practice, the market often values these companies more on a story, management credibility, and “hot money” flows into certain commodities. Today those are things like Gold, Antimony, Tungsten, Copper, REE, maybe Uranium.

The failure risk is enormous: the geological odds of success are estimated at 1 in 2000, funding is episodic and dilutive, and the time to potential cash flow is measured in decades. And many teams are dysfunctional.

The key parameter we use is Enterprise Value (EV). In short: cash plus debt. All the money that has been poured into the business (not all of it effectively, and a majority often simply into salaries). Let me show what I do with some examples:

Lets say there are two companies, both with $5M cash (all numbers USD). A typical amount after their first raise on the stock market.

Company A is an Explorer in a conventional, proven location (like the Laramide Porphyry Belt in SW USA):

-100 km² license package.
-Located in the Laramide Copper Belt (Arizona/Mexico), proven endowment, world-class neighbors already in production.
-Good infrastructure, mining-friendly jurisdiction.

Company B is a ""Blue Sky"" Frontier Explorer, way up in Nunavut or Northern Namibia (jurisdiction OK, but not a known belt):
-1000 km² license package.
-Located in a frontier jurisdiction (e.g., parts of Africa or Central Asia) with little proven copper endowment.
-Poor infrastructure, higher jurisdiction risk. Some opaque legislation makes it hard to model outcomes for a foreign actor.

In proven belts, especially for Cu or Au, we would use a land value of 200k-500k per sqkm. So company A is valued at $20-50M plus cash = max $55M.

Company B in an unproven belt basically has moose pasture. We heavily discount the probability of them finding a deposit, even if they are assumed to be competent. Lets say 10% as good as the Laramide. So 20-50k per sqkm.

10 times the ground position gives them max $50M, plus cash = $55M.

Many many juniors stall at this $50M market cap. Its among the most popular valuation. And therefore we should be very careful with investing at this valuation. $10M in a debt-free, recently starting company with similar land position is a good ""value"" entry point, exit at $40M or before they run out of money. Because once exploration stalls, the lack of a discovery starts to crystallise into the reality.

The second way we value is using an adjusted NAV (asset value of future discovery, discounted by the likelihood of actually finding it). Like trying to value a lottery ticket based on the size of the prize.

Let’s assume a “discovery” in the Laramide belt could eventually become a 200Mt @ 0.5% Cu deposit, with a net project NPV of ~$2B once built.

I mentioned industry statistics suggest the probability of a grassroots explorer making a discovery that reaches production is about 1 in 2000.

But in the Laramide Belt, odds may improve to 1 in 200–300 given proven fertility, leveraging existing historic work, and proximity to infrastructure (lowering the threshold for something being economic).

In a frontier region, odds may be worse, say still at 1 in 2000.

Company A (Laramide):
-0.5% chance (1/200) × $2B NPV = $10M expected value.

Add cash on hand (EV): $5M = ~$15M equity value.

Market might still pay a premium for attractive metal like Cu/press narrative/management = $20–30M cap.

Company B (Frontier):
-0.05% chance (1/2000) × $2B = $1M expected value.

Add cash: $5M → ~$6M equity value.

Market perception might lift to $10–15M if commodity (e.g., copper) is hot.

This is why I would say the mid-point $40M is an excellent exit point for a given position on a safe bet exploration play. Track record of the board is often earning a small premium but in my opinion its largely anecdotal and ALL companies try to inflate their credit to hit this extra premium.

So who is at this level already? Alta Copper TSX:ATCU (drilling out a resource but authorisation obstacles), Group11 (probably overvalued), Hannan Metals (way overvalued given their assets), District Metals (also way overvalued).

Who is close? Atico CVE:ATY (actually they have a short-life resource so probably undervalued), Havilah Resources (almost 1Mt Cu plus gold in the ground, 70% undervalued I would say), Max resources (using average of EV and NAV as above).

Who is way below: Anglesey Mining AYM.L (historic mine, small land position, jurisdiction has legislative risks), Firefox gold (lack of any real discovery), Eurobattery Minerals (I think their ground is terrible).

Anyway think about this when evaluating early stage exploration juniors. There is a lot of noise on this forum about juniors and its really easy to value them.

If there is interest I will post something on strategic metals because they might allow us to add extra value due to ""offtake interest"", or tax incentive from the jurisdiction on a future discovery.

1ns5fjr,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 16:27:49,Overpriced Equity Market Bonds & Other Safe Assets,"One thing I learned quite hard way is not try to predict the market. However, the current equity market is at all time highs and prices look quite expensive except few stocks which got hammered down.

From this perspective, I am thinking whether it makes sense to start moving money to bonds. I had been doing small investments in bond market from last year however it is becoming increasingly hard to beat inflation after the returns.

2024 Bond market really came down and I am thinking with an equity crash whether we will see lower interest rate again. However, I can see what could happen with government debt being so high and they could repeat what they did in 1945.

""1945 financial repression"" refers to the period following World War II when many governments, including the United States, implemented financial repression policies to manage their high debt loads. These policies included artificially keeping interest rates low and controlling financial institutions to reduce the real value of their accumulated government debt and lower debt-to-GDP ratios. 

**Key characteristics of financial repression after 1945:**

* **Low Interest Rates:** Governments set interest rates at artificially low levels, often below the rate of inflation, to make their debt cheaper to service. 
* **Government Control:** Authorities often controlled the financial sector, directing capital and limiting financial choices to ensure government debt was held and that funds were available for public investment. 
* **Debt Management:** The primary goal was to reduce the burden of war-related debt, which was as high as 100% of GDP for some nations in 1945. 
* [**Liquidation**](https://www.google.com/search?cs=0&sca_esv=fe0550819d8f48a0&sxsrf=AE3TifObF5u0NPdhgBJxFHFY-DAM6Kj92g%3A1759004713747&q=Liquidation&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjksOGY4_mPAxW9T6QEHfIxAR4QxccNegQIDhAB&mstk=AUtExfCKxmEa5io003LXQvDvn6s5Ds91RdDLKbDc81Ze5vtNs2hVxSCN3UGoiv4XBBBSwYxre-TFvMh5lEWFyL76MmTOItadNveCyw1wNwSLXmFgwftSDAUgWDI94PGrnAgd2LXuiUotq9vOOTuLHHz9HXJGAvJElEX49LPf33941jXVtac&csui=3) **of Debt:** By keeping real interest rates negative, governments effectively ""liquidated"" their debt, meaning the real value of the money owed to bondholders decreased over time

It looks a bit more scarier than a 2008 because both equity and bond markets look riskier. Gold would have been an option but you cannot be 100% gold in a portfolio and Gold is at all time high.

Would like everyone's views or hypothesis and may be a good strategy can be carved.

Update Here is what Claude AI said on this. Worth reading.

""Based on current evidence, here are the key indicators that suggest the US government may be preparing for or moving toward financial repression policies:

# Direct Policy Indicators

# 1. Debt Management Crisis

The debt limit was reinstated at $36.1 trillion on January 2, 2025, representing the total amount of outstanding debt. The Treasury is already using extraordinary measures, including tapping civil service and postal retirement funds to meet federal obligations. This shows the government is under significant debt pressure.

# 2. Interest Rate Suppression Mechanisms

Markets are pricing in continued Fed rate cuts, with 89% probability of another 0.25% cut at the October 2025 meeting and high odds of additional December cuts. This suggests policy makers are committed to keeping rates low despite potential inflationary pressures.

# 3. Yield Curve Control Discussion

Under yield curve control (YCC), the Fed would target longer-term rates and pledge to buy enough long-term bonds to keep rates from rising above target. While not yet implemented, countries are actively using YCC policies in real time, suggesting this tool is being seriously considered.

# Structural Economic Indicators

# 4. Debt Servicing Pressure

The rise of net debt cost-to-government-revenues ratio is expected to slow in 2025, partly because short-term yields have declined, somewhat narrowing the yield gap between maturing and new bonds. This shows the government is acutely aware of debt servicing costs and benefits from suppressed rates.

# 5. Institutional Framework Changes

In December 2024, GAO recommended that Congress consider immediately replacing the debt limit with an approach that links debt decisions to spending and revenue decisions. This could remove debt ceiling constraints that currently limit the government's ability to implement financial repression.

# Historical Context

Financial repression policies involve measures that enable governments to place debt with financial institutions at ""artificially low interest rates,"" and it wasn't just the US that used this method historically. Financial repression is intended to help governments deleverage over time by artificially lowering yields on government bonds.

# Key Warning Signs to Monitor:

**Immediate Indicators:**

* Implementation of yield curve control by the Federal Reserve
* Regulatory pressure on banks to hold more government bonds
* Capital controls or restrictions on international investments
* Negative real interest rates becoming persistent policy

**Policy Rhetoric:**

* Emphasis on ""financial stability"" over market-determined rates
* Discussion of making the financial system serve ""national priorities""
* Increased regulation of pension funds and insurance companies

**Market Behavior:**

* Unusual Treasury auction dynamics or direct Fed intervention
* Persistent yield curve suppression despite inflation
* Regulatory changes that effectively force institutions to hold government debt

The current situation shows many preconditions for financial repression are present: high debt levels, political pressure to keep borrowing costs low, and central bank tools that can suppress longer-term rates. While not yet fully implemented, the infrastructure and justifications for such policies are being established.""",0,1,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ns5fjr/overpriced_equity_market_bonds_other_safe_assets/,new,Question / Help,0.25

However, if you look closely into Waste Management (WM), it is one of the most durable compounding machines in the U.S. economy. On the surface, it looks like basic trash collection, landfill ownership, and recycling. But under the surface is an almost impossible moat to replicate:

High barriers to entry - New landfills are extraordinarily difficult to permit, regulate, and finance. The existing network of WM is an irreplaceable asset.

Pricing power with inflation pass-through - Many contracts allow them to alter rates automatically, while still protecting margins.

Capital allocation discipline - WM will consistently return free cash flow via dividends and buybacks, but continues to reinvest to become more efficient.

This is a business that thrives in the background of daily life. While investors are lining up stocks for the next tech disruptor, Waste Management is compounding wealth by managing something that society literally cannot live without.

1nrr08f,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 05:36:00,Why did DNNGY rally ~30% yesterday while D2G barely moved? (Ørsted ADR vs German listing),"Hi everyone — I’m trying to understand a puzzling divergence between Ørsted’s U.S. OTC ADR and its German listing.

DNNGY (the U.S. ADR) apparently shot up by around 30 % yesterday (or thereabouts).

But D2G (the Frankfurt / XETRA listing) did not mirror that magnitude of move (or barely moved).

To my understanding:

DNNGY is an OTC ADR in USD, and D2G is the listing on German exchanges in EUR.

They represent the same underlying company (Ørsted).

So what could explain such a discrepancy? Some hypotheses I have:

- Timing / delay in market adjustments across jurisdictions

- FX (USD/EUR) translation effects

- Low liquidity or order book depth in the ADR market

Has anyone seen similar behavior with ADRs vs home listings? Or have insight into how Ørsted’s ADR / D2G mechanics might contribute to this?

1nrqsah,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 05:21:27,Tell me why I shouldn't invest in Greggs (GRG) - UK food to go chain,"Strong balance sheet.
50% reduction in share price this year.
PE at 11. Usually at 20.
Analyst ratings broadly positive. 
4.5% dividend

Moats include:
Very strong brand recognition. Up there with McDs or Burger King in the UK. 

It's the most inexpensive option. I dont see weak consumer sentiment as an issue. I've traded down to it recently and it's always been heaving. There's nowhere else for the UK consumer to trade down to, other than complete behaviour change (prepping food at home). And that will be more than mitigated by the middle classes starting to eat there (see Aldi and Lidl) if things continue to worsen. 

All the headwinds around inflation and taxes on employees will also affect the competition and Greggs are well placed to survive this (see balance sheet) and eat up the spare demand when others fold. I also think there's some room for them to increase pricing a bit. £3 bacon roll and coffee could go higher and they would still outcompete the rest on price. Likewise the £5 lunch deal which is about half that of Subway (hardly a premium option!)

But maybe im missing something because they are being heavily shorted by hedge funds. What am I missing?

I have recently found Etoro in the market, did not even know they went public. It was my first trading app downloaded and used back in 2017. The App is heavily marketed towards beginners and it works, however, it is not the best for long term traders. 

The stock is currently heavily down, however, when i look at their financials, it tells me a different story.

For example on a yearly basis , Revenue up 225%, Gross profit up 41%, Their total assets up 48% with an increase in liabilities specifically accounts payable which increased 235% ( i assume from marketing).

Their cashflow statement is good as well, with an increase of 140% in cash from operating and a significant decrease in cash from investing, which means they are acquiring assets (which i like).

Their PE ratio is reasonable and not over priced like Robinhood. AI and analysts give this a strong buy, however the current market price says other wise.

Step I:

\- scrapes major subreddits like wsb valueinvesting etc. for all ticker mentions in the last 24 hours  
\- goes through openinsider to see any new cluster buys and notes the ticker  
\- goes through everything on dataroma to see if any superinvestor has bought anything recently

this gives us [step I spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sX6mbFIG7uiQxbCwPuF-tp2am5TspgLoEXmqwrAeAJ0/edit?gid=0#gid=0). Basically a list of interesting tickers to look at. Currently has 2320 entries and updated every day.

Step II:

\- filters out tickers that got there by mistake / wrong names / etfs etc.  
\- a deeper dive into things we like to see like insider buying, share reduction over the last year, superinvestors that are also in. Based on this it assigns each opportunity a score.  
\- people will say why not current ratio, rising revenue, etc. it is because these signals are often noisy and corrupt the data. Too many outliers and variations in financials

this gives us [step II spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sX6mbFIG7uiQxbCwPuF-tp2am5TspgLoEXmqwrAeAJ0/edit?gid=359346395#gid=359346395).

Step III:

\- we get ideas with the highest score based on step II  
\- the real fun begins we use the latest model of gemini to get the following  
\- business summary, company history, moat analysis  
\- management record, management incentives, catalyst analysis  
\- price history, bull thesis, assumptions baked in, bear scenario  
\- next steps to look at / questions to ask

The result is this sick [Step III spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sX6mbFIG7uiQxbCwPuF-tp2am5TspgLoEXmqwrAeAJ0/edit?gid=831501853#gid=831501853). Just take a look at how beautiful the analysis is. Gives you a solid basis to look at companies. New models are really good at getting info from the web so that's SEC filings, earnings calls, news, etc. so I cannot recommend it highly enough. I think valuation is a very personal thing which one should do themselves but qualitative analysis with the good and bad is a good starting point.

Step III script is slow because it calls the LLM for all these small qualitative things, but should eventually catch up with the previous ones.

# 1. 🔥 Reboot Spotlight to Rival TikTok

* **Algorithm Overhaul**: Invest in AI-driven personalization to boost content discovery and engagement.
* **Creator Monetization**: Launch a revenue-sharing model for creators to attract talent and viral content.
* **Social Commerce Integration**: Embed shopping features directly into Spotlight to tap into TikTok’s 43.8% conversion rate.

# 2. 💰 Monetize the AR Platform

* **License AR Tools**: Offer Snap’s AR tech to third-party apps, retailers, and advertisers.
* **Easy Lens Expansion**: Scale the AI-powered lens creation tool for brands and SMBs.
* **AR Commerce**: Enable virtual try-ons and interactive ads with direct purchase options.

# 3. 📈 Scale AI Advertising

* **Smart Campaign Suite**: Expand AI ad tools for SMBs to automate targeting and boost ROI.
* **Attention Metrics**: Promote Snap’s eye-tracking and media quality tools to advertisers for better performance tracking.
* **Sponsored Snaps & Promoted Places**: Package immersive ad formats for travel, retail, and entertainment brands.

# 4. 🧠 Streamline Operations

* **Cut Moonshots**: Pause or spin off hardware projects like Spectacles unless they show near-term ROI.
* **Lean Product Teams**: Consolidate overlapping features and reduce engineering overhead.
* **Focus on High-Margin Revenue**: Prioritize Snapchat+ and AR ad formats over low-margin brand ads.

# 5. 📊 Financial Discipline

* **Target Positive Free Cash Flow by Q4 2026**: Set aggressive cost controls and revenue benchmarks.
* **Debt Restructuring**: Address \~$1.5B net debt burden through refinancing or asset sales.
* **Quarterly Profitability Goals**: Tie executive compensation to operating income milestones.

# 6. 🌍 Expand Demographic Reach

* **Grow Beyond Gen Z**: Develop features for older users—family sharing, professional networking, and secure messaging.
* **Global Expansion**: Localize content and ad tools for emerging markets with high mobile penetration.

# 🧩 Bonus: Acquisition Contingency Plan

If Snap fails to hit profitability targets by 2027, prepare for strategic acquisition talks with:

* **Amazon** (for AR commerce)
* **Apple** (for camera tech)
* **Netflix** (for short-form content)

Snap’s tech is strong. Its user base is loyal. But without bold moves, it risks becoming a niche app with cool features and no future. This roadmap is about **scaling smart, monetizing hard, and cutting deep**.

* Some firms like Apple, Home Depot have done repurchases brilliantly, while others have destroyed billions.

-Operate in oligopolistic markets with high barriers to entry.

-Have recurring, sticky demand regardless of economic cycles.

-Generate significant free cash flow, which gets returned to shareholders or reinvested efficiently.

-Benefit from inflation pass-through in ways investors don’t always price in.

1nr7bir,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 13:21:56,It might be time to bet the farm on Constellation Software ($CSU.TO) and Topicus ($TOI.V),"Constellation Software is one of those ""if you know, you know"" companies. For those unaware, the founder and CEO Mark Leonard just stepped down as president of the company for health concerns. He will still remain director of the board, and current COO Mark Miller will assume the President role. 

This guy belongs in the same conversation as Warren Buffett for the capital allocation GOAT. Since the 2006 IPO, Constellation has returned ~35% per year, making it around a 200 bagger in 20 years. This didn't come from a single home run product like Google or Facebook, it was just 20 years of masterful capital deployment by acquiring vertical market software businesses.

I don't want to list out every financial performance metric here, but do yourself a favor and look up a 10 year chart for revenue and free cash flow per share. They keep the share count exactly the same, they don't have high debt levels, and they deploy nearly all of their free cash flow into new acquisitions. The performance is simply staggering, given the size. 

Well, after the news of Mark Leonard stepping down, shares of $CSU.TO are cratering. This is really surprising to me, as Leonard has made it a point to insist that the system that management has built doesn't rely on any single key figure, but more on a culture of excellence spread through a series of decentralized operating groups. Either way, I think the market is offering us a great discount on one of the best businesses in the world. 

Topicus ($TOI.V) is a spin off of one of the aforementioned operating groups, employing the same strategy as Constellation Software, but with faster growing companies based in Europe. Leonard is still on the board, and the Constellation DNA is very evident.

 I’m a student at the University of Florida majoring in Business Administration. I’m interested in working in finance, specifically in equity research, and I’m using Reddit to practice writing notes and reports on market headlines I find interesting.

I’d really appreciate any feedback on my write-ups, both on the content and on how I can improve my analysis, interpretation and presentation. Thanks in advance for your input!

Starbucks has reported six straight quarters of declining same-store sales, though the latest 2% drop was better than expected. CEO Brian Niccol announced new restructuring efforts aimed at cutting costs and focusing on long-term growth.

The company plans to close 900 underperforming stores and reduce corporate jobs, with employees receiving support packages and benefit extensions. Savings from these cuts will be reinvested into store redesigns and innovations, with about $150,000 planned per location.

By fiscal 2026, Starbucks targets a 30% reduction in costs and will introduce a new standalone store design featuring 32 seats and a drive-thru. While these changes may help over time, the turnaround won’t be immediate. Higher menu prices from inflation and long wait times, made worse by online orders remain challenges for customer experience at a brand positioned as a quick-service restaurant.",1,1,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nr6ndg/starbucks_restructuring_plan/,new,Stock Analysis,1.0

* Relatively low PE ratio of 11.45 (per Google Finance).
* 3 Year Revenue CAGR of \~22%, but most recent quarter had negligible growth Y/Y.
* Margin improvement has been insane. In FY2024, they improved adjusted EBITDA margin from 11% to 22%. Most recent Quarter (Q2 2025), has adjusted EBIDTA margin of \~29%. Management has a goal of 35%, and they look on track to execute.
* Strategy focused on ads/monetization, enterprise, and AI. They seem to be executing well on all of these fronts, but the one I'm most excited about is enterprise. They've had some recent acquisitions and a new subsidiary set up to start focusing on these clients and enterprise staffing using their existing talent pool and platform just seems like a no-brainer. 

For me, the main thing to worry about is the drop on revenue growth, but at the current PE ratio, it's not really priced for strong growth anyways. It seems like an obvious buy based on the improvement of margins alone, but given the potential in Enterprise, I feel like there's reason to be optimistic about growth as well.

1nqzyr0,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 08:25:42,Is Google Stock a Still Bargain? 10-Year Return Expectations,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better.

However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it.

When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value.  
After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years.

From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500.

Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations.

Anyways here are the results:

FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR  
EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR  
Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR

So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price?  
Probably not.

Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs.

That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding.

Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels.

For me this is a clear hold.

If you want to look at the calculations for the model:

1nqzog9,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 08:11:15,Small portfolio value investing: focus on fundamentals over flashy trends,"Been thinking about the challenges we face as retail investors with smaller portfolios, especially when competing against institutional money. After watching countless retail investors chase meme stocks and AI hype over the past couple years, I keep coming back to the basics that actually work for our scale. The math is pretty straightforward: with less than $100K, every percentage point of loss hits harder, so protecting capital becomes even more critical than chasing the next big thing.

What's worked for me is sticking to companies with consistent earnings growth over 3-5 years, keeping debt-to-equity ratios below 0.5, and actually reading the financials instead of following social media buzz. Sure, it's boring compared to swing trading hot stocks, but compound growth from quality dividend payers has been way more reliable than trying to time market swings. The real edge we have over institutions is patience and the ability to hold positions without quarterly pressure from investors.

Anyone else finding that the fundamentals approach works better with smaller accounts?

IONQ revenue growth is obfuscated through acquisitions - they do not separate out revenue by segment, hence no way to tell what’s organic and inorganic. 

Current contracts are for research purposes - again there is no current viable path to profits using quantum computers. 

The largest issue with quantum computers is the error rate. With a ~0.1% error rate per operation, as operations scale the results therefore become useless.

The stock is up 800% in the last year. This parabolic move without commensurate fundamental economic shift is synonymous with a bubble. 

The CEO is making outlandish ungrounded claims to value (eg. Floor being at Cisco levels with the ceiling being like NVDA)

Initiated a short position via long dated puts options far outside the money.

Can someone who knows more about this comment?,"With the whole health sector taking a pummeling in the past year (and admittedly, there still being a possibility of downward pressure during this presidential term), VRTX has taken quite a beating amidst regulatory hurdles.  Today's FDA designation for Vertex Kidney Disease drug is positive but I'm very intrigued by the process in which VRTX/CRSPR has begun to commercialize Casgevy.  It seems to be in the very early stages but seems to have a long-term potential for a large bump in revenue growth.  I guess it remains to be seen how profitable it can be but I imagine that will only improve with time over long term horizons.

I will fully admit that this sector is not something I'm very knowledgeable about but it seems to me if you're banking on CRSPR playing a huge role in the future of medical treatment, and with the rollout starting in recently, now would be a great time to invest in the company that stands to benefit the most from its success.  I've been following the CRSPR story for a while waiting for when ""hope becomes reality"" for its treatments and it seems that transition is occurring now.  Am I way off base here?

1nq9ft6,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 11:13:18,Thought on investing in Qualcomm (QCOM) over the long term: 20-40 years,"I’ve begun looking into QCOM these past few months .. was talking with a buddy who knows a good bit about semi-conductors, but not very much about investing. 

My buddy is a big fan of QCOM largely due to their patents and market share - according to him, nearly every single cell phone (Apple, android, and any other brands) use QCOM technology to make their phones, and those who do not use QCOM technology in their cellular devices, still owe a percentage of revenue/royalty to QCOM on sales due to QCOM’s 300,000+ patents surrounding wireless communication.

I love the sound of that, but obviously concerns regarding a monopoly arise in my mind. I’d like to gauge the sentiment of you all - is the fear of QCOM being labeled a monopoly and/or their patents being stripped away a major long-term concern?

QCOM has a solid 2% annual dividend yield, with a reasonable PE ratio of 16.5 - $10.3 billion in revenue last quarter and $2.7 billion in net income should mean they are roughly producing $40 billion in revenue annually, and making more than $10 billion in net income (25% + profit margins). 

I’ll obviously continue to look further into QCOM before making an investment, but like I said, want to hear the sentiment of you all. A company I would like to build an initial position in, turn on dividend reinvestments, and periodically add to the position over the next decade or two.

1nq8xah,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 10:53:52,5 Ways I Manage Risk in My Stock Portfolio,"As markets grind higher, I find more of my analyses and thinking erring on the side of caution. This is not a sell everything post. I just think it is worth revisiting not just how we make money but how we avoid losing too much of it. Admittedly, I am rereading Howard Marks remarks over time which may also be influencing my perspective.

Nevertheless, I wanted to share 5 things I wrote down and do to keep risk in check, specifically as it pertains to my stock portfolio:

1. I invest in quality stocks. By quality I am referring to stocks that have durable moats, strong balance sheets, and consistent profitability. Generally, these companies tend to fall less in downturns and recover faster.
2. I attempt to avoid overpaying for companies. This is because even great companies can be terrible investments at the wrong price. I use relative valuation as well as DCF analyses to find companies where the market's expectations are reasonable.
3. Diversification. Concentration seems to be a more acceptable avenue for portfolio construction these days. I am not knocking it, but I do not think that there is value in diversification to manage risk. I use ETFs to provide the foundation for my portfolio, while carrying individual positions that are built to about 5% of my portfolio. Yes. I let winners run.
4. Cash can offer incredible benefits. And there is nothing wrong with building cash positions when things appear stretched. Cash is not dead money anymore. Today, cash can earn 4-5% while also providing confidence when things get scary.
5. This one is not for everyone, but I selectively sell calls on positions that I perceive are overheated. Doing so generates income and trims risk. There are risks to this strategy, though.

To be clear, none of these eliminate losses. But taken together, the goal is to make downturns survivable and gives us the confidence to be opportunistic.

I elaborate in a bit more detail [here](https://arbalistmoney.com/5-ways-i-protect-my-stock-portfolio-from-risk/), if interested.

1nq8qsz,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 10:46:50,Short-term vs. long-term,"Lately, I’ve been struggling with the question of whether I should stick to a long-term investing strategy or try to take advantage of short-term opportunities, especially in the tech/AI sector.

On one hand, companies like NVIDIA, Amazon, and ASML have strong long-term potential and are part of big trends like AI and semiconductors. But on the other hand, valuations are stretched, and the market seems overheated in the short term.

Should I wait for a correction? Or keep dollar-cost averaging into strong names regardless of short-term price?

Both strategies have risks:

* Going short-term can lead to emotional decisions and timing mistakes.
* Going long-term might mean holding through big drawdowns, especially if a stock was overhyped.

How do you balance short-term market signals with long-term conviction?

Recently, I’ve been buying stocks with a part of my salary every month. This makes saving money every month a lot easier (and more entertaining) for me. So far, I have Intel, United Healthcare, Energy Fuels Inc and Boeing stocks in my portfolio. Among these stocks, I wanted to hear your opinion about Boeing. 

Before I bought Boeing this week I had a silly notepad listing some of my reasons:

* US government backing
* Production of F-22 successor F-47
* Palantir collaboration
* Already has a high backlog of orders
* Started delivering to China-orders were halted since trade wars
* China expected to order up to 500 planes
* Turkish Airlines expected to order 250 planes (order is expected to go through today 09-25)

I recognize that it is definitely not the greatest company out there and is dealing with a lot of problems. However, from my perspective the company has a clear path for future growth. I believe the reasons I listed outweighs the company’s current problems. This is clearly not the case for most people and company is not attracting investors. 

As the absolute beginner here, I wanted to hear from you, why I’m wrong and the flaws of my logic.

(Couldn't see how to edit title?)

Opened new position yesterday at $6.36.

Synopsis:
- Fast casual chain based out of Chicago featuring Chicago favorites (Italian beef, hot dogs, Polish sausage, etc.) and standard fare (burgers, fries, etc.)
- IPO'd in 2021 at $20, quick run up to over $47, mainly declining since
- Market cap $477M
- Down 45% last 3 mos, 51% last year
- CEO since 2018 was termed this week, new CEO search now underway

Financials (a/o end 30 Jun):
- $727M revenue +3.62% growth
- 40.3% GP, 10.3% op margin, 4.8% net, 13.2 EBITDA
- Book value $6.38/share
- Debt to equity 1.29

Risks:
- Catching a falling knife?
- Same store sales pretty stagnant
- Growth slowing
- Popularity for Chicago style food outside Chicagoland and select transplant areas (e.g. FL, AZ) is not a given, especially given it is quite unhealthy and GLP1 use
- More capital intensive restaurant model than other fast casual competitors 

""So I have that going for me"":
- Still quite early in terms of national expansion possibilities - as of Nov last year, just 10 states and <100 stores (may have increased some since then)
- Fiercely loyal core fans of the food
- Lowering interest rates outlook benefits their debt situation
- Room to improve margins with more focus on efficiency and innovation
- Valuation on low end
- +2.2% price over the last week, which includes CEO change annlincement

Getting in now is a bit of a gamble I'll admit. Been on watchlist for awhile. Decided that the CEO change, pause in the falling price, and rate cuts are enough potential catalysts to stake an initial position (1% of trading account).

Disclaimer: I am Chicago native who likes the food but lives outside the area and wishes they'd expand to my state. 

Interested to hear other opinions.

JPM recently raised PTs to $14 and GS to $12 as the company begins to develop a significant foothold in the specialty and affordable medicines space. I believe the stock will continue to increase due to these 3 reasons:

1. AMRX trades at a discount to peers on EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples. If execution continues, re-rating toward peer multiples alone could justify $12–$15/share

2. Historically, Amneal was weighed down by debt post-merger. Stronger operating cash flow, refinancing (just completed this summer) at lower rates, and paydown efforts are improving the capital structure

3. The company has over 100 ANDAs pending, including complex generics that carry greater barriers to entry. Recent FDA approvals and launches (GLIADEL Wafer, biosimilars like Releuko and Fylnetra) show execution capability

and most importantly...

  
LEADERSHIP!!!

Amneal is co-led by two CEOs, Chirag and Chintu, who have an incredible grasp on the pharma space and have the entire company ""bought in"" on their mission. Amneal went public via a merger in 2018 and peaked at around $24 before crashing by over 90%. Chirag and Chintu, who were on the Board of Directors at the time, returned post-crash and began to assemble a new leadership team, which has resulted in significant growth over the last 5 years.

1npnv31,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 16:58:37,"How capitalism will collapse run away from money, run toward gold now","
There’s a huge job market crisis, the threat of AI, and people are scared of the future. What happens next? People afraid of what’s coming don’t want to hold money anymore they put it into safe assets. They buy gold. The dollar drops in value.

Yes, I think people should abandon the dollar the paper money that companies and the rich hoard. It’s useless in this economy. Hoard gold. Hoard real assets.

Companies keep generating profits, quarter after quarter, but they don’t hire people. They just grow richer and more independent from workers. But are they really? If being rich is measured by how many paper dollars you own, they can become poor overnight if people simply refuse to value paper money.

If 99% of the money belongs to the rich, then the poor should just stop using it. Leave paper money behind.

I read that 100 years ago, the amount of gold an average person could buy with their salary was much higher than today. That shows how worthless paper money has become.

So leave paper money and buy tangible assets gold, and others with real value. Companies can multiply paper money endlessly, but they can’t control limited assets.

This is the era of walking away from useless paper money. Young people will never be able to buy a home with paper money.

Go for gold, go for limited assets, go for things with real value.

Yes, companies generate profits but don’t hire anyone. Fine. Then I opt out of this system. I won’t hold my savings in paper. Every salary they pay me, I convert into gold or other tangible assets.

They pay us with paper shit that’s worth less and less in this economy. So keep only the bare minimum of paper for basic needs and save the rest in gold. That’s something they can’t print, can’t multiply, can’t control with interest rates.

Protect yourself from latestage capitalism, because money will keep losing value.

As companies hoard all the paper money, let them. We, ordinary people, should leave them with their useless paper while we hold gold and real assets just like before they tricked us into replacing real value with worthless paper.




Today, gold is the back swan event, because the dollar will soon collapse. Companies hoard all the profits, house prices in dollars are insanely high, and paper money is worth nothing.

I go to work, I get paid a salary and that only makes sense as long as, in some reasonable perspective, I can afford a house. A big house with a pool, not a rat-sized apartment for 3 million.

But young people today? They’re supposed to believe that if they just keep their jobs jobs that might not even be taken over by AI they’ll maybe afford a house in their 50s or 60s.

Paper money is worth nothing. The real Black Swan event that people don’t even see is this staying away from paper money. Buy assets. Buy value. Buy tangible things, not worthless paper whose value keeps dripping and dropping every year, paper money loosing value is a sure thing ",0,29,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1npnv31/how_capitalism_will_collapse_run_away_from_money/,new,Discussion,0.29

I started to understand value investing as I got more experience, and one thing I've struggled with is managing my own life and keeping in touch with the news. When my personal life gets busy (exams, tests, internships, traveling), not following the news a lot of times make me feel like I'm losing out on profits. 

An example from my experience is that I bought ASML around February and it stayed at around the same price until their earnings report I think 2 months ago (could be wrong on the time). The stock fell 10% due to the report and I had to decide whether I want to buy more. It fell as their earnings report detailed that due to tariffs and other factors, their earnings might not grow in 2026 (very rough summary). As I was busy during that time, I didn't feel informed enough to double down on my position, which looking back on it now, I think I would've if I took the time to look into it (obviously could be hindsight). 

For more context, I hold stocks usually for over a year, and I look to hold companies that are undervalued with wide moat. Therefore, although I'm not as impacted by short term new sentiment, I do wish to capitalize on it when I have firm belief in the foundational value of a stock and the movement  is just short term.

1npj763,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 13:59:30,Is Sprouts Farmers Market ($SFM) Undervalued?,"$SFM has been touted as a long-term growth company; but, after climbing almost 475% in a relatively short time (5 years), has shed 20.3% of its share price in just the past month.

To be completely upfront, I picked up shares of $SFM at $140/share back in February.  At that time, it was right on the border if its intrinsic value calculation.  From a Value Investing perspective, I didn't give myself much Margin of Safety....  Nonetheless, I was thrilled as the stock climbed to $182/share...only to tumble to its current level of $116/share.  So, my thesis is that $SFM is indeed undervalued.

What caused such a precipitous drop?  Well, we all know that Mr. Market is moody, fickle, unbalanced, the list goes on.  The market has soured on specialty retailers and grocers; so no surprise that while Sprouts continues to expand and grow, it's stock is being sold.  Let's look at a few numbers \[with help from Simply Wall Street\]:

**Discounted Cash Flow Model:**  FCF sits at $499.6M.  Based on analysts' growth forecast, FCF is expected to hit \~$922M by 2029.  DCF's model then calculates the stocks fair value at $236 per share; or, undervalued by 49%.

**Price vs. Earnings:**  Sprouts' current PE Ratio sits at 24.3x, with the industry/peer average around 21x.  SWS's ""Fair Ratio"" (incorporates the company’s actual earnings growth, sector-specific risks, profit margins, and even market capitalization) comes out to 22.0x; so in context, SFM isn't too far off.

**Other Models Quick Summary**:  Without belaboring the data, looking across several other models I find fair valuations ranging from $155 to $209.  My own calculations using the conservative Rule #1 model yields a ""Sticker Price"" of $132.56, and thus a 20% MoS of $106.05, or ultra-conservative 50% MoS of $66.28.

I see a target of opportunity for anyone willing to hold the company for more than just a short-term swing trade.  So, I still have my original shares at $140 (yes...in the red right now), and I have cash covered PUTs to buy additional shares at $120 and $115.  I'm still not giving myself much MoS, but for a company with relatively low long-term debt to FCF, and ROIC consistently over 10% for the past 10 years, I'm happy to be a part owner of Sprouts Farmers Market for the next several years.

  
UPDATE:  Yep.  I see it.  $SFM down again today (25 Sep).  I continue to scour for news as to why, and continue to find bull-case articles and assertions that it is ""undervalued"" and ""oversold""--likely a result of fund managers behaving like lemmings as they often do.  This reminds me of $RH where they were crushed by tariff news, then had a better-than-expected quarter (plus tariff postponement) and over-rebounded, then fell off a cliff again.  It took a few months, but now they are showing signs of a more reasonable, slow-steady climb (I sold my shares at $230).  I'm anticipating a similar pattern for SFM.",7,60,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1npj763/is_sprouts_farmers_market_sfm_undervalued/,new,Stock Analysis,0.65

His fiance is pregnant with their first child. A baby boy so I am a grandfather at the age of 43. I would like to do something to give my grandson a little head start when he gets older. I would like to open a stock portfolio for him now. He will be born in March. Then, let it grown until he is about 30 years of age or so. I figure by that time he will have completed college. Be settled into a career and possibly be settled down a little. 

I tried investing in bitcoin and the stock market years ago. I picked the wrong time to do it. It turned out to be right before COVID and it was all bad. I lost a good bit of money. I contribute a good bit of it to not knowing what the hell I was doing too. Now I have been doing a lot of reading and research. I started a little project since then where I invested a little money to get my feet wet and was able to do pretty good. Therefore, I would like to start another project for my grandson.

I did pretty good with a little small portfolio I put together for practice. Just a couple hundred bucks to get my feet wet. I basically just picked stocks from companies whose products I use and know about. I work in computer repair so most of the stocks were technology stocks. I know about diversifying your portfolio. That ETFs are more conservative where individual companies is more risky. So I know the basics which is why I am asking for help and advice.

My question is if I do something like I just did where I start a small portfolio. Say maybe $500 to start. Then, if I add a little money to it monthly (maybe over time other family members with pitch in) do you think I could grow it into something decent by age 30 or so? This is an amount of money I wouldn’t be upset with if I was to lose it all as long as I have a really decent shot at successfully completing the mission. 

Would it be better to maybe split the money between two portfolios? One conservative and one pretty aggressive? What would be a good strategy to go about this? Like I said I am a single parent. I am far from well off. I wish I had thousands I could have smartly invested. However, that is not the reality, and I want to leave my grandchild SOMETHING.

1npenuj,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 11:07:57,WATER STOCKS,"Hey Folks, 

  
I’ve been looking into the recent IPO of **WaterBridge Infrastructure (WBI)** and wanted to get some perspectives from the community.

**Quick summary of the IPO:**

* Raised **$634M** by selling 31.7M Class A shares at **$20/share**.
* IPO was upsized due to stronger demand.
* Debuted on the NYSE mid-September and reportedly jumped \~14% on day one.
* Operates primarily in the **Delaware Basin**, providing water gathering, transport, recycling, and disposal for oil & gas producers.
* Business model includes **take-or-pay contracts**, which in theory could provide stable cash flows.

**Points I’m curious about:**

1. How do you see WBI’s risk/reward profile given its exposure to oil & gas cycles and regulatory risks around water disposal?
2. Does the IPO valuation look reasonable compared to other water infrastructure or midstream companies?
3. Are there comparable publicly traded peers (water management in energy, midstream infrastructure, etc.) worth benchmarking against?
4. Do you view this as a potential **long-term infrastructure play** tied to water management, or more of a niche/speculative investment?

Just hoping to hear some analysis and opinions from those who follow IPOs, infrastructure, or energy-linked companies.

Thanks in advance!",2,1,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1npenuj/water_stocks/,new,Stock Analysis,0.75

1npdpk7,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 10:31:39,CRWV and CORZ,"All previous crypto mining stocks transitioning to AI/HPC are going up. Why? Because big tech is throwing money at them. MSFT, META, GOOG CEO’s have all acknowledged that the biggest restriction to AI growth is power not GPUs. Which companies have the most amount of power to power data centers? CRWV and CORZ. The demand is so far beyond what people currently understand. 

MSFT threw a $19B deal at NBIS for 300MW + 400MW extension. CRWV has 470MW active as of Q2 2025, and target ~1000MW by year end. They are a preferred NVIDIA partner. NVIDIA also announced that they are backstopping any excess cloud from CRWV for up to $6B up to 2030. Even if they need it or not, they agreed to this. CRWV has 2.2GW of contracted power capacity that they can expand into (the bottleneck). 

CORZ has $5B market cap. They have 900MW of power that is active and dedicated to AI but needs connecting to GPUs etc. another 400MW used for Bitcoin mining, bringing total to 1.3GW. They also have 1GW of expansion also possible. They had 50MW active and powering GPUs by Q2 2025. Year end goal is 250MW. That is 5x the revenue they were generating before. They also still have 650MW more to expand to. Remember NBIS got a $19B deal for 300MW + 400MW possible expansion. I value CORZ at $15B market cap, would not even think about selling before. I expect them to crush next earnings call and market to price them closer to fair value. For the acquisition by CRWV deal, this will not go through unless CRWV stock goes up a lot higher maybe $200. Shareholders are not happy with current deal (Two Seas capital which is largest active shareholder has shown opposition). Stock price also tanked ~30% after deal announcement, but this will also not go through unless shareholders approve (big opposition over current deal). 

Finally, just want to mention big hedge fund buying. Jane Street and Coatue Management are hedge funds that have outperformed the market significantly over last 3 years (achieving 90%+ and 180%+ over last 3 years) have made CRWV their biggest holding at 4% and 8% respectively. There is also a cracked OpenAI guy (1st in his class in Columbia) that started his own hedge fund called Situational Awareness who has like 65% returns over last two quarters has CORZ as his third biggest holding at 20% of his portfolio.

They are profitable with good margins, growing, got a great CEO who has been with the company for almost 10 years, share buybacks and more - yet the stock chart looks like they are going bankrupt.

I read trough their balance sheets and watched all interviews with the CEO and i cant find a single reason why the market is overreacting like this.
One of their recent aquisitions ""Oddjams"" has a lawsuit against them for scraping odds data from third parties but i feel like its hard to really combat data scraping and pinpoint whats legal and what crosses the line. Even if guilty, it may take years for the lawsuit to resolve.

In the meanwhile GAMB is using their insane cashflow to aquire more and more businesses while growing their marketshare and diversifying income streams.

This feels like a generational buy at these levels - i would argue there is assymetric alpha here.
The fair value of the stock is about 60-70% upside from just ebit and cashflow. Factor in the meme-worthy ticker that will tickle the wallstreetbets fans and a CEO that knows what he is doing (and is rewarded with an options plan if the stock price reaches X for 6 months) and you got a great play in my books.

Personally (and funnily enough) All-In on the stock at these levels.
Market thinks this is an affiliate marketing company but its missed that all the buyouts diversified away from it with a much broader setup for the future. They are quietly buying companies to build out their offers and tech worldwide.

Feel free to give your opinion!

One section talks about the factors that drive stock prices. Graham breaks them down into three categories:

* **Market factors**
* **Future value factors**
* **Intrinsic value factors**

These factors not only influence the bids and offers in the market (which ultimately set the price), but also serve as the line between *speculating* and *investing*, depending on which factors you choose to focus on.

Big drop in free cash flow last year. Over the last five years, they averaged about $6.5 billion. Last year, just $3.5 billion. Looks like they made some capital improvements, but check out the five-year net income versus the one-year net income. Not great.

Men’s underwear, cardboard boxes, and giant skeletons: Offbeat recession indicators to watch

Unemployment and consumer spending can signal the direction of the economy. Some believe more nebulous data points hold clues too.

Emma Ockerman
Tue, September 23, 2025 at 7:02 PM GMT+2 7 min read


From Labubus **(1)** and men’s underwear to lipstick and skirt hems, signs pointing to or away from a recession are everywhere.

Whether they’re accurate indicators of the economy's health is another matter.

Here’s how recessions are actually defined: A committee with the National Bureau of Economic Research **(2)** that maintains a chronology of US business cycles pores over official monthly releases from government agencies, like employment and income data, to date periods that represent a “significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.”

That process can take a while. In June 2020, for example, the NBER declared the country had entered a recession **(3)** in February of that year — an unusually fast determination. In July 2021, the NBER said **(4)** the country had exited the recession in April 2020. **(5)**

Otherwise, experts turn to other reliable, albeit unofficial, recession signs, including two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, or the “Sahm rule,” **(6)** which finds the start of a recession occurs when the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate rises 0.5 percentage points or more, relative to its 12-month low.

Now, with consumer sentiment tanking, inflation ticking higher, the job market stagnating — and social media users speculating that short, bare nails **(7)** herald economic malaise — here are other less-than-traditional measures to watch.

Cardboard boxes

Cardboard box demand is sometimes seen as an indicator of economic health, since the majority of what consumers purchase touches corrugated cardboard. Here’s the not-so-great news: Right now, US box makers are cutting back on production, ** (8)** said Jadrian Wooten, an economist at Virginia Tech. Box shipments are also down.


“I love this recession indicator, or I guess potential indicator, because it is such a common item that I think a lot of people take it for granted,” Wooten said.

Even former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan reportedly used to track cardboard prices. **(9)**

“The cardboard box industry is incredibly large — we’re talking close to $100 billion in revenue,” Wooten said. “What I always tell my students at Virginia Tech is that it’s four times as big as the NFL, and they hear about the NFL every day, on TV, on social media, there are video games about it. We don’t have that about the cardboard box industry. It’s so much more important.”

Many US boxes are shipped abroad, and exports are expected to weaken amid trade tensions, **(10)** which could help explain lower packaging demand. US consumer spending, which has so far remained resilient, may also grind lower as prices rise, dimming the need for tons of shipments.

Right now, the cardboard story is also one about capacity, Wooten said, with multiple plants being taken offline in the most dramatic cuts since the Great Recession.

All of this taking place before the holiday shopping season is doubly concerning.

“This is actually the peak time for the holiday season that we would expect to see ramp-ups in cardboard box production happening,” Wooten said. “That’s probably the biggest concern in terms of a pending recession: Companies are not ordering cardboard boxes to put their products in to then send to Target or Walmart for the holiday season.”


If looks could indicate

Americans have long sought to tease economic signals from fashion and style choices. It’s been said, for example, that skirt hemlines lengthen, natural roots start to show, men’s underwear goes unreplaced, and clothes grow more muted during an economic downturn.

It’s also been said, however, that many of those “indicators” are far from reliable. The hemline index in particular has been debunked **(11)** — midi skirts trended in 2019, for example, when economic conditions were otherwise solid, and micro-mini skirts trended around the time the dot-com bubble burst.


And it was Greenspan, again, who told NPR **(12)** that a dip in men’s underwear sales could be indicative of a troubled economy.

But is it?

“I cover Hanesbrands and Gildan, which both make underwear, and I can tell you that nobody at either company has ever told me that,” said David Swartz, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar.

“Greenspan was totally blindsided by the economic crisis in 2008, so clearly his underwear indicator did not help him, did it?” Swartz added.

During times of economic hardship, retailers may say consumers are becoming more “choiceful"" **(13)** or discerning in their purchases.

“It doesn’t mean that they don’t spend, it just means that they aren’t necessarily spending on things as they would if the economy was in better shape,” Swartz said.

The 'little treat' economy

A few months after the 9/11 attacks — at which point the US was already in a recession — Leonard Lauder, then the chairman of the Estée Lauder Companies, said ""when things get tough, women buy lipstick,” according to a Guardian report from the time. **(14)**

""In stressful times, many consumers are reaching out for those small indulgences that provide momentary pleasure,” Lauder said.

This sentiment started being referred to as the “Lipstick Index,” and it somewhat tracks with the idea of today’s “little treat economy,” or the rise of people indulging in more affordable pick-me-ups (an iced coffee, maybe, or a cute keychain) as a form of self-care.

“I don’t know that there’s any clear evidence that women decide to buy more lipstick because they feel bad about the economy or something like that,” Swartz said. “My opinion would be that when there’s a recession, people cut back on everything, and that probably includes lipstick.”

More indicative of economic conditions, perhaps, is whether or not people are going out to eat, which is generally more expensive than cooking at home. And restaurant traffic is indeed on the decline, **(15)** with the cost of food away from home up 3.9% in the past year. **(16)**


“You can also look at things like sales in discount versus sales in department stores,” Swartz said. “We’ve seen much stronger results from retailers like TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack and Ross compared to department stores. We’ve also seen weakness in the luxury space.”

Giant skeletons

Sean Bagniewski, a Democratic state representative in Iowa serving the Des Moines area, posited in a newsletter he sent in August that the apparent lackluster demand for giant, 12-foot skeleton sales at Home Depot could suggest economic rain clouds ahead.

He has his own “Skelly” and noted that “there are lively Facebook groups that focus on this and other Home Depot Halloween items each season.” Despite retailing for $299, they often sell out fast when they hit stores. And, since Home Depot (HD) did not do a spring sale of Halloween decorations this year, Bagniewski told Yahoo Finance, it seemed likely that August’s decoration drop would generate a lot of interest.

“Though I have one, I was curious to watch how the Skellies got snapped up when they were released at about 5:15 one morning earlier this month,” he wrote. **(17)** “In 2023, all of them were purchased within the hour. In 2024, all of them were gone by noon. This year, there were more than 3,000 that were still available on the Home Depot site 13 hours after they were released.”

“That’s not as fancy as Greenspan economics, but I’d say it’s interesting anecdotal evidence that folks are feeling a pinch in their pocketbooks,” he added.

A spokesperson for Home Depot said they couldn’t “share any sales specifics around any products,” though “we continue to see fans embracing Skelly into their Halloween collections.”

As of the morning of Sept. 23, Skellies remain in stock. **(18)** Indeed, some commenters noted in a Facebook group devoted to Home Depot’s Halloween products that they had tighter budgets this year or were waiting for discounts, though others spent thousands of dollars on decorations.

Still, Bagniewski sees red flags when families scale back on luxury items that make their kids happy.

“If people aren’t buying those — and it’s been a hot-ticket item in past years — then that should be somewhat of a warning sign,” Bagniewski said.

He said a lot of companies are pulling back on hiring because the outlook feels uncertain. He also doubled down on being cautious with rate cuts, worried that moving too early could let inflation slip out of control. On top of that, tariffs are still a risk for prices, and while AI is boosting investment, the long-term impact is still up in the air. Powell also admitted the stock market looks pricey by historical standards, but kept a neutral tone. The only hint was that “moderately restrictive” policy could mean there’s room for gradual, measured cuts ahead.

Bowman, on the other hand, took a much more aggressive stance — saying the Fed should cut sooner to prevent job losses and layoffs from snowballing.

1noy49y,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 20:28:19,Crocs stock - value trap?,"Hey everyone! 

Long time lurker, and longer time value investor.

I’ve had a position in Crocs for some time now. Disappointed with the recent dip, but I believe the market has oversold pretty heavily. I’m considering adding to my already heavily allocated (as a % of my portfolio) position.

The company has been growing revenue and cash flow for quite a while now. They’ve been buying back shares and paying down the debt from the HeyDude acquisition aggressively. While the acquisition has panned out as a bit of a disappointment (see the recent impairment), it has undoubtedly taken the company to another level. They are forecasting revenue declines for the current quarter which hasn’t helped the stock price. 

All that being said, this company is selling at dirt cheap multiples. Even adjusting for the revenue decline, it will be one of the most undervalued cash flow streams in the market. The balance sheet is relatively healthy, and I’m expecting them to announce having purchased 2-3% of outstanding shares during this quarter - as the price is deflated.

They have shown significant international sales growth despite the slow down in the Americas. Their shoes are priced at some of the lowest levels versus most of their competitors AND they still get a higher margin than most of them. The management team has even advised part of the revenue decline is due to a pull back in promotions to preserve brand integrity. On the HeyDude side, revenue has been showing notable declines - although a bullish investor can attribute this to a shift in business model to drive D2C sales at higher margin than HeyDude’s wholesale strategy. 

I wanted to gather this community’s thoughts. Is their last report and this current quarter the start of the end? And therefore the market is pricing their stock accordingly? Or is this a true value play with blood in the streets and far too negative market sentiment for a historically great company (and one that still looks to be a good deal even if revenue declines over the next 5-10 years).

1nou72b,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 17:36:40,Thoughts on Target Corp-Possibly good ROE at these levels.,"Not an owner at present, looking for discussion from people who've looked at this stock before.

Obviously Retail is a mixed bag of margin compression and macro risk. Tariffs are the elephant in the room here.  Target has struggled way more than other big box retailers. However,  I think target is getting close to a good value oriented entry point here.  It is currently trading at less the 10x last year's stated free cash flow.  Previous years, with the exception of FY2023, see average comparable FCF yields.  I see them possibly upgrading their rewards program to drive more traffic.  Over the past ten years, they have bought back approx. 40 percent of their shares outstanding.  They have raised the dividend and have seemed resolved to keep it's dividend intact.  Also another factor here is the real estate porfolio within the overall stock price.  Including the real estate, the actual retail business of Target seems to be valued at very low valuation, if not, negative.  

Now what I'm saying here is not that Target is going make any gigantic headway in it's stock price, but I do believe it's possible for them to offer a decent return on equity through dividend and possible additional buyback opportunities via its cash flow.  I could see Target reclaiming its affordable chic mantel within the retail landscape.  

The only reason is even bring this up is I see Walmart, Costco, Amazon trading at fairly high multiples.  My curiosity is whether a retailer with maybe some more upscale exposure should be trading at literal fractions of a multiple lower.  

Let me know what your thoughts are, what am i getting wrong, and what you think is a better option in terms of VALUE investing.

Just wanted to get your feedback on my stock analysis of PayPal. 

PayPal does not need any introduction, it has been a major player in FinTech but has recently been challenged by the new competition landscape (Apple Pay, Google Wallet, Adyen...) and revenue growth has slowed to single digits which has brought the stock price down. 

Looking at their Business model, they make most of their money (around 90%) through transaction fees from Merchants and Consumers. With the world going digital with payments, this is a good model. Moreover, they will soon launch the PayPal World service which will interconnect the biggest payment schemes from Latin America(Mercado Pago), India (UPI), and China (WeChat). This last point gives them momentum to reach for new markets and expand their revenue growth. 

Taking into consideration their financials (from Yahoo Finance), PayPal has a Debt to Equity ratio of 60.25%, signaling healthy signs. Moreover, the forward P/E is 11.67, which is also low. Lastly, they are undergoing a big share buyback policy, which would ultimately bring share prices up. 

I haven't done any Discounted Cash Flow model to calculate the stock price, but looking at some analysis on Youtube, it seems like the intrinsic value of this stock is around USD 120. 

I personally think they are some good upsides with this stock and wanted to share that thought with you. If you would like to challenge that, please be my guest, I am looking forward to hearing your arguments.

Their GLP1 drugs treat one of the most common ailments on earth, and yet they are beaten down while the market is at all time highs. However, I’m not going to be making much of a bull case for GLP1’s here, others have done that. This post is about identifying lesser known companies that stand to benefit from the bull case for GLP1’s coming to fruition, as well as international markets. Here is what you need to know: 

The biggest news I really hope you know as a GLP1 investor is that semaglutide’s patents expire (all of them) next year in Canada, India, Brazil, Turkey, and Mexico. This has been well known for a while so it's not a huge drag on NVO or LLY, but we should all consider what generic GLP1’s hitting the market at the same time as orals next year will do. These two coinciding events could rapidly diminish the spooky novelty and price of these drugs, driving demand and adoption throughout the world. Next year will be pivotal, but this also raises the question, which companies are making the first truly affordable versions of these drugs?

First, this won’t be a market for just any generics maker, only those experienced in manufacturing biosimilar peptides and injectables will have a chance here, so it's not as zero-sum as some simple pressed pill generics market. The first mover will be the Swiss generics maker Sandoz (SDZNY) which plans to have generics on shelves in Canada by January at around $75 dollars a month (\~70% discount to current prices). That is the price of a nice gym membership. The other confirmed entrants in Canada will be Apotex (private), BIOCON.NS, and Dr. Reddy’s (RDY). Expect TEVA pharma and Viatris (VTRS) to enter later.  

I like SDZ quite a bit, price-to-sales of 2.4, forward P/E of 25. It’s up 45% this year but that's not ridiculous in this market. Here is some quick back of the napkin math: 

Current estimate is 2026 total revenue grows from 11B to 11.875B, 3%(300M) increase y/y from 2025 growth. Currently 1M Canadian GLP1 users, 4M total type 2 diabetics. Let’s say SDZ gets 500k of sales at $75 for 10 months of 2026, that is 375M of new revenue from just Canada GLP1’s next year. This is an extremely rough estimate, but I buy the general case of SDZ’s revenue from just GLP1’s next year being underestimated. 

RDY like SDZ is an experienced biosimilars manufacturer and has plans to aggressively enter all markets open to generics, especially its home market India. With a p/e of 18, p/s of 3, basically no debt and \~800M in cash RDY looks like a value play in an expensive market. If these drugs take off in these foreign markets this could be criminally undervalued. Now a bit more on these markets specifically:

Brazil is an underrated market, there are \~70-80M Brazilians who have private health insurance and make up a wealthier cohort who live very much like the average American. A study found this cohort’s life expectancy (83yrs) is actually higher. Of this privately insured cohort, \~14M are obese, and \~6M have type 2 diabetes. This is much larger than the Canadian market, and should be made up of fairly analogous market participants. There are, of course, the other 150M Brazilians as well. Consider [HYPE3.SA](http://HYPE3.SA) as a pure Brazil play, but SDZ, RDY, BIOCON, and TEVA will all be here as well.

Expect BIOCON, RDY, and SUN Pharmaceuticals to dominate an Indian market that while very large (70M-85M type 2 diabetics), will be extremely crowded, and frankly hard to gauge in terms of adoption. I want to buy BIOCON as they are an experienced exporter with a large Canadian presence, but I’ve had no luck doing so because there are no ADRs. 

A final note on generics, TEVA may win in the end at least revenue-wise. They are the generics giant, have the most know-how, and have quietly already got their foot in the door. Just a couple months ago they started making generic liraglutide in the US, an early GLP1 (not very good, so not a huge deal). This won’t impact their bottom line but it builds their GLP1 production capability for free, expect them to enter these markets aggressively, if you like the value here like I do, make it your top generics play.

Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) is a speculative play that I’m sure many of you have probably heard of. They make an oral that just completed phase 2 trials successfully, but the market hated the results due to high expectations. Personally, having read the study, I think it was blown out of proportion and it's valued nicely as a speculative play. I certainly like their drug better than Amgen’s or Metsera/Pfizer’s because it is an oral with genuinely good weight loss results already in phase 3 trials.

Telemedicine is the last obvious place to look here, the pick is LifeMD (LFMD).  NVO and LLY are never going to do business with HIMS again after the compounding issue, and HIMS cannot directly sell semaglutide or tirzepitide at all. LFMD has direct partnerships with both LLY and NVO and directly sells on their platform. Buy this as a fairly pure GLP1 play in telemedicine, and don’t worry too much about them getting sued, that's just a right of passage for telemedicine companies (seriously though). The valuation here is also just flat out good, 1.3 p/s (compared to HIMS’ 6.5) and analysts are rating it with serious upside right now. I may have buried the lede here as LFMD is arguably the purest GLP1 bull case play other than NVO and LLY and it is nice and beaten down, the red flags are the lawsuits and potential regulatory issues with telemedicine. 

A final note: NVO’s EVOKE Phase 3 Alzheimer’s/Dementia study will report results by the end of 2025, maybe any day now. Results will likely be middle of the road, if they are bad, well, we’ll take a hit with losing potential dementia treatment upside. But if results are good the sky might be the limit here, if GLP1’s can significantly treat obesity and Alzheimer’s with an oral pill… well you do the math. Get in or get out before these results drop. 

My GLP1 portfolio is about 35% LLY, 20% NVO, 15% LFMD, 10% TEVA, 10% SDZ, 5% RDY, and 5% VKTX. Good luck all.

1nonf0l,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 13:18:11,The Denison Mines investment thesis.,"The Athabasca Basin region contains the world's highest uranium grades, and Denison Mines is capitalizing on that. Denison has four low cost uranium development projects which they have a range of interest, 22.5%, 25.17%, 70.55% interest, they include a mill, another mine, and some exploration.

As it stands, their balance sheet is solid having just received 333 million in cash bringing them to $721 million in cash, uranium and investments. They sold convertible notes in a capped call strategy, which means that investor can buy a certain number of shares up to $4.32 for the next 6 years with an annual coupon of 4.25% (way better for reducing stock dilution)

Their flagship project, Wheeler River, will develop two assets, an in situ recovery operation for onsite processing, and a convention underground mining operation with a milling toll at their 22.5% mill. The capital expenditure of this project is $429 million. It's a 16.5 year mine with an 11 month repayment and in IRR of 90%. Production is planned to startup mid 2028.

Not to mention a huge amount of the float and stock is owned by institutions.

All that is to say, I think the bull case for DNN is incredibly strong with current market and geopolitical context. Kazatomprom, the largest Uranium producer in the world is running into bottlenecks to keep up with demand.

I think there is strong potential for DNN to see a continued interest from investors. This kind of company with a $2.5 billion market cap is actually one that could be a lot higher. Cameco who operates in the region 37 billion. How quickly can Denison grow and further develop their balance sheet?

1non3ev,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 13:05:49,Is $BIRK the most undervalued stock in footwear?,"Hey r/valueinvesting. I thought I would do my first DD post. I've been expanding my horizons into consumer goods stocks lately.I am mainly a tech growth guy, but I may have found a gem with Birkenstock. Birkenstock is an iconic German footwear brand that has been around since 1774. Recently they've started selling boots, clogs, and have now dabbled into the skincare world. They went public in Oct. 2023 at $46/share and dipped post-IPO, but has been slowly climbing back. Now shares are trading around $45 with a market cap of 12 billion. With a P/E of 25, I'm seeing plenty of brand-recognition moat, growth, and consistent revenue growth. If you've stepped onto a college campus recently you may have noticed the explosion of sandals with Gen-Z. Since Birkenstock is the main brand of sandals, Gen Z should be coming back to keep buying for the rest of their lives.

* Revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 20% in the last few years, hitting 1.5B in FY2024. Net income margins are improving up to 10% thanks to their premium pricing and increase of efficiency. $BIRK has also expanded into the Asia-Pacific region and DTC now account for 40% of their sales, up from 30% pre-IPO.
* With 250 years of history, their products are positioned higher than a fast fashion trend. Average selling price is steadily increasing 5% per year.
* Forward P/E is currently at 19. Completely reasonable for a growth stock in consumer goods. If they are still on track to climb their revenue 20% this year, they will hit an EPS of $2.50.
* Birkenstock is aiming for 100+ new locations by 2027.

Their balance sheet is clean: EBITDA <1x, 300 million in free cash flow, with upcoming buybacks and dividends. I think $BIRK is screaming 'opportunity.'

The only downside I think is plausible is that they are not recession-proof. No one will buy $150 sandals in a recession. Overall, I still think $BIRK could be a great play over these next years.

1nom5ay,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 12:30:44,JP Morgan buy thesis on ASML,"From JP Morgan: ""TSMC has started to ramp up its 2nm process and this process ramp will continue in ’26 when their lead customer, Apple, is likely to start using this process. There have also been press reports yesterday that Nvidia is expected to be the first to adopt the upcoming A16 process at TMSC which will implement backside power. If these reports are true, then TSMC would need to ramp up significant capacity for A16 in ’27 (when it is likely to be in production). A16 will need 1 or 2 more EUV exposures than 2nm and thus will be particularly positive for ASML because of the increase in lithography intensity but more importantly because of the volume of wafer capacity that would need to be added if Nvidia were to start using the leading edge process (Nvidia has been using a process that is 1 or 2 generations behind the leading edge on its leading edge processors till now). TSMC would need to start preparing for Nvidia ramp in terms of orders and building capacity in 2H26 which would result in stronger orders/sales for ASML from TSMC in both ’26 but definitely in ’27.

HBM-related demand remains robust and memory pricing has not shown weakness. Indications have been that Samsung is possibly closer to qualification for HBM4 at Nvidia as well, which would be very positive for equipment shipments starting end of ’26 into ’27. Thus, risks that ASML guides to a weak ’26 are becoming much less likely in our opinion and ’27 trends will be strong (though not guided so soon by ASML). Importantly for the stock, once ASML guides to ’26 revenue range on October 15th, only ’27 will matter and though ASML will not guide to it, the market will speculate on positive trends and that should help the stock. ASML also continues to trade below prior average multiple of 30-35x and thus appears attractive. We reiterate that ASML remains our top pick in ‘25.""

Positive sell side reports have been a major catalyst for ASML over the last month. Coverage of ASML had become widely negative throughout '25. There are two bear theses which are related. The first is that litho intensity has peaked in terms of capex requirements to move to the next nodes. The second thesis is that high-NA won’t be adopted for a while as it is not economic. 

While TSMC didn’t introduce scaling at the N2 node as they moved to the new GAA transistor architecture (nanosheets), we should see scaling at the next one or even two nodes again—which will be a positive for ASML. On the second bear thesis, the positive is that high-NA is much more economic than EUV at its early introduction, as EUV’s uptime and productivity were extremely low. The technology had all sorts of problems and there were continuously bear theses flying around that the technology will never make it. The positive for ASML though is that even if high-NA gets delayed, more multiple patterning with EUV tools will be needed at the most advanced processing steps, which actually increases revenues and margins for ASML (high-NA is lower margin than EUV due to current low capacity levels).

So, the long term bull case for ASML is that:  

1. TSMC at its next one or two nodes will start scaling again, leading to increased EUV demand as more EUV process steps will be needed again.  

2. TSMC is building out three fab clusters—one in the US and two in Taiwan, where capacity requirements are increasing due to the boom in AI demand.  

3. DRAM is becoming more EUV intensive, due to the scaling roadmap.  AI is very DRAM intensive (HBM), boosting needed fab capacity.  

4. ASML has zero competition.

I'd add some charts here with further details but apparently Reddit doesn't allow this - anyways, more background on the current outlook in AI can be found here, which is an important driver for future  ASML tool orders:

- Citigroup have upgraded their price target to £14.40 / $19.44. (The difference appears to be that Citigroup have recognised how massively exciting the Nuclear Energy side of the business is, whereas Goldman haven’t even mentioned it.)

- Nuclear energy stocks are roaring upwards, sending nuclear energy speculative stocks soaring despite being loss-making, and despite no revenues in some cases (OKLO!), so it’s only a matter of time before attention turns to a high-growth, cash-generative business like Rolls Royce, which keeps announcing new deals.

Sure I’ve missed so many things there as all the many divisions of Rolls-Royce seems to be on turbo charge at the moment.

With aviation demand rising (and especially from Airbus more than Boeing),  with defence spending rising, and with the growing and desperate need for more sustainable energy solutions from nuclear, etc etc, it is inevitable that Rolls-Royce will be announcing more deals on all fronts in the coming weeks and months.

So I know everyone is saying this isn’t a bubble (it is but not like 2000) cus evaluations are rising with earnings so it’s a justified melt up (whatever you get what I mean) but none of these earnings are coming from anything tangible…

All the mag7 companies that have slimmed down over the last 3 years are flush with cash and any big capex like 500m deals on AI build out or data centers is just a vapid money washing scheme that makes everyone’s earnings seem massive and impressive and holy shit look how profitable all these companies are but when you look past the deals no one is actually pulling any value out of consumers???

Sure, Google impressions are rising yada yada. How much is openAI actually worth if they need subscriptions to a service and there’s 20 other chatGPTs doing the same shit when the curve levels out (I guess my thesis also relies on AI not exploding as fast as everyone thinks and taking over every job ever in 3 years)

Im just wondering if I’m in the right ballpark and if you guys can see where this leads. Is there a turning point in this bubble where the piper needs to be paid and everyone gets exposed as snake oil salesmen all colluding to make themselves look highly profitable?

Background: As a hobbyist value investor, my daily routine looks like this: Wall Street Journal, Google News, The Guardian, Yahoo News… rinse and repeat. The result? Tons of time wasted, with only a tiny fraction of useful information. Even worse, by the time I finally find a truly relevant piece of news, the market has already reacted，umm....like a gossiping neighbor who’s always two steps ahead.

So about six months ago, I just built my own tool, named Deeptracker. The original idea was pretty simple:

1. Automatically track the news for me
2. Push it to me within 1 minute of publication
3. Bonus: attach a quick “market sentiment score” so I don’t lose my sanity

Recently, I hustled my way into getting **12 people** to try it. Yep...twelve, not twelve hundred... But hey, I tried . The feedback was actually better than expected:

* Some said it saved them tons of time hunting for relevant news
* Some said it caught details they would’ve missed manually
* One even said it’s better than finviz (and to me, that’s like winning a medal )

Of course, there were criticisms too:

* “Alerts are nice, but sources must be authoritative.” (I swear I hooked it up to legit sources!)
* “Features could be expanded.” (Sounds a fair point  :)

I can’t wait to find out:

1. Do you also feel buried under the daily avalanche of news?
2. If you landed on my product page, would you at least think the design is okay-ish?
3. Or should I just accept that DT is my quirky personal tool, and the market demand might not even be real?",0,5,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nof2q8/does_anyone_actually_need_a_free_personalized/,new,Investing Tools,0.14

I try to explain to them what I have achieved and they listen politely and nod and at the end they say ""good work"" before they take the conversation in a 90 degree turn away from the topics of investing and me being awesome. 

I do searches such as asking google ""is 30% a good return on my investments?"" And then devour every scrap telling me how well I am doing. It conjures an image in my mind of someone(that would be me, I am the someone in my minds eye) masturbating while simultaneously they have stuck a hose from one of those pedal press bike pumps deep in the ear and the person(again, the person being spoken aboit here is me) rhythmically alternates between q stroke and a foot tap ad nauseum... stroke, foot tap, stroke, foot tap, stroke, foot tap, stroke, foot tap, stroke...  each action engorging a different body part, both stealing blood from the other temporarily in a struggle to engorge themselves. 

Sorry for that detour. Moving on, I remember the GFC and all the wealth that was wiped out and i remember feeling so bad for everyone affected by the situation... and then some years later I saw that all the wealth had come back and now new records were being smashed. This was when I started to research investing and more crucially, I explored the ideas that came to me from me and overtime I tweaked my ideas, I added components from other steategies, I poured over statistics, I read countless charts and over nearly a dozen years, I had come up with my own investment strategy. Since I first started my investment journey at the beginning of april last year I have refined my strategy, making it better and Dropping what didn't work. The most improvement has come from receiving validation of my methods via results and that has allowed me to use the conviction I now feel to more fully apply my strategy, where before I would sometimes hesitate and buckle (selling too soon, not buying when I should have).

Anyway, I wanted to post images but I dont have the requisite amount of karma so I will just type it out.

My total returns sit at 48.13%, annualised that works out 30.81.

At it's best it's gone as high as a total of 55% and annualised rate of returns of 40%.

I do not use, nor do I understand options, puts or calls. 

I'm not leveraged or using a margin call or whatever it's called. I use no debt whatsoever. 

Currently I have 3.68% in cash and 96.32% in stocks.

36.88% is in US stocks and 73.12% in AU stocks.

US stocks:

Total P/L (USD) 5,771.32

Total Profit (USD)+7,906.82

Total Loss (USD)-2.135.50

Win Rate 74.29% across 105 different posistions.

AU stocks:

Total P/L (AUD) 20,017.17

Total Profit (AUD)+24,112.73

Total Loss (AUD)-4,095.56

Win Rate 73.49% across 83 different positions. 

My Win Rates for both AU and US have both been as high as 80% in the past and are both at the lower end of the spectrum atm. 

I believe that I can see things that others are blind to, that I approach investing wildly different from most people. I regularly watch YouTube videos of people picking stocks and I am blown away by how differently we think and while on the topic of YouTube investors has anyone else noticed how rubbish these people are? I have not seen a single person, not one ever, EVER post a total profit/loss statement covering from start to finish.  

I ask these cringe inducing wankers to please post said total profit/loss and they respond with (what are you? My wife? I dont have to do nothing you tell me to do buddy"" or better still they just ignore me. We all know this is because they are all haemorrhaging money and are travelling through Loss Country. I have an idea for a YouTube channel that attacks these buffoons and posts advice on investing, but I have a unique idea regarding how it would be executed and generate revenue. 

I just realised I have been in a manic state for some time now and had better put a stop to this before it gets even more. Anyway, what do you guys all think of my results so far?

1no7n26,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 00:06:13,$RMCF - Not Financial Advice,"Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory (RMCF) is a ~$1.70 microcap that runs ~250+ chocolate shops/franchises plus wholesale/e-comm. They do around $30M in revenue annually, but the market cap is only -$4.8M net loss), but has started showing positive EBITDA in recent quarters and is rolling out a turnaround plan.

Why it’s interesting:
1. Valuation: Trades at ~0.4× sales - dirt cheap compared to branded specialty retail.
2. Brand footprint: 250+ locations, with new flagships opening (Chicago, Charleston).
3. Execution plan: New e-commerce platform, packaging rebrand, updated POS/ERP for franchisees, and cost discipline (pricing + SG&A).
4. Potential: If margins normalize (20–30% gross, 10–12% EBITDA), the stock has meaningful upside from this tiny base.


Valuation Scenarios:
1. Worst-case: Flat sales, weak margins, dilution → $0.00–$0.40/share.
2. Base case: Margins improve, EBITDA breakeven in 1-2 years → $2.50–$4.00/share.
3. Bull case: Strong margin expansion + brand growth, ~10× EBITDA → $5.00+/share.


Catalysts to watch:
1. Continued gross margin recovery toward 20–25%.
2. Successful rollout of new e-comm + branding.
3.Same-store sales growth + higher franchise royalties.
4. Operating leverage from POS/ERP deployment.
5. Franchise expansion momentum.


Bottom line:
This is a high-risk, asymmetric play - downside could wipe most of the equity, but if the turnaround sticks, upside is 2-3× (base) to 5× (bull). At $1.70, you’re basically paying less than the price of a candy bar for each share in a national chocolate brand.

1no64zm,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 22:48:39,The SMR Nuclear Renaissance seems to be a pipe dream being build on sand,"To get this out of the way, I am not anti-nuclear. I am however, struggling to understand how the economics make sense. I see a lot of posts and comments suggesting it is the only clean energy source that can provide growing baseload power, but the conversation rarely delves deeper than that. 

From what I've seen, the economic and logistical case for Small Modular Reactors seems to completely erode when looking at market data, historical project performance, and even fundamental physics. It looks to me like SMRs are not a viable solution for modern energy needs, as they seem economically uncompetitive, appear to be mirroring the nuclear industry's record of project failure, and could even exacerbate the unresolved problem of radioactive waste.

&nbsp;

**1: Costs:**

Data from Lazard's Levelized Cost of Energy analysis shows that unsubsidized utility-scale solar and onshore wind are the cheapest forms of new generation. 

- **Onshore wind** can have a levelized cost of energy as low as $27 per megawatt-hour, with a midpoint of $50.
- **Utility-scale solar** is similar, as low as $29 per megawatt-hour with a midpoint of $60. 
- **Gas combined** cycle plant has a midpoint cost of $77 per megawatt-hour. 

The only recent U.S. data point for new nuclear, Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4, has a realized cost of approximately $190 per megawatt-hour. So finances from out our most recent reactor build shows costs that are more than three times more expensive than new solar and wind. It doesn't seem like SMRs will be cheaper. The Department of Energy itself modeled a median cost per megawatt that was over 50% higher for SMRs than for large reactors

Even when you account for grid stability using a Levelized Full System Cost of Electricity model, the system cost for renewables in Texas is around $97 per megawatt-hour, which is nearly identical to nuclear at $96. This model assumes only 5% firm backup power, but the U.S. grid already has about 25% firm capacity from existing nuclear and hydropower, which makes this a pessimistic scenario for renewables. It seems likely that wind and solar are far cheaper than nuclear even when using this full system cost model.

&nbsp;

**2: Poor Track Record:**

 On top of this, the nuclear industry has a consistent, international record of severe budget and schedule overruns, which makes it hard to believe claims that SMRs will be delivered on time and on budget. 

For example, Plant Vogtle in the U.S. was originally estimated at $14 billion for completion in 2016 or 2017, but it was finally finished in 2023-2024 at a cost of around $35 billion. That's a 150% cost overrun and a seven-year delay. Ratepayers in Georgia will pay an extra $7.6 billion for it. Also, after completion, Vogtle Unit 3 was offline for 9.5 of its first 48 weeks. 

It's not just a U.S. problem either. The Flamanville-3 reactor in France began in 2007 with a €3.3 billion budget and a 2012 completion date, but it was finished in 2024 with a final cost of €13.2 billion - a 300% overrun and a twelve-year delay. An official audit even places the total cost at €19.1 billion. This pattern seems to be holding for existing SMRs. 

The world's only three operating SMRs, two in Russia and one in China, had cost overruns of 300% to 400%. An SMR in Argentina has a 700% cost overrun. China's first SMR took 12 years to build instead of the planned 4, and its second one is projected to cost twice as much per megawatt as a large reactor.

The flagship SMR project in the U.S., NuScale's Carbon Free Power Project, failed before construction even began because of unsustainable costs. It was terminated in November 2023 because its power was just too expensive for utilities to buy. The construction cost estimate for the 462 MW plant increased by 75%, from $5.3 billion in 2021 to $9.3 billion in 2023. 

The capital cost per kilowatt rose to over $20,000, which is comparable to the much larger Plant Vogtle. The target price for NuScale's electricity surged by 53%, from $58 per megawatt-hour to an unmarketable $89, and that was even with a $1.4 billion subsidy from the Department of Energy. 

Projections for other SMR designs look even worse. JP Morgan estimates some Western SMRs may cost $15 to $20 million per megawatt. Bill Gates estimated his 375 MW Natrium reactor would cost close to $10 billion, which is nearly $30 million per megawatt - double the per-megawatt cost of Vogtle.

&nbsp;

**3: Waste and Liabilities** 

Contrary to some of the marketing claims, it seems SMRs will actually produce significantly more radioactive waste per unit of energy than large reactors. A 2022 Stanford University study found that due to greater neutron leakage in small cores, SMRs will magnify the existing nuclear waste problem. The study suggests SMR designs will increase the total volume of nuclear waste requiring disposal by a factor of 2 to 30. They would also generate at least nine times more neutron-activated steel than conventional plants per unit of energy. On top of that, after 10,000 years, the radiotoxicity of the spent fuel from the SMRs studied would be at least 50% higher per unit of energy compared to conventional fuel.

This new, more complex waste would be added to a global stockpile of 400,000 metric tons of spent fuel, which is growing by over 11,000 tons annually, for which no country has a permanent disposal solution. The U.S. alone has over 88,500 metric tons of spent fuel stored at 75 sites across 33 states, and that number grows by 2,000 tons per year. There are other liabilities and risks to consider as well. Nuclear plants consume a lot of water, somewhere between 500 and 800 gallons per megawatt-hour. In contrast, solar PV uses only 2 to 20 gallons for cleaning, and wind turbines use virtually none. 

There are also massive unfunded cleanup costs. The global unfunded liability for decommissioning energy assets is $7.5 trillion. In the U.S., the failure to create a permanent waste repository has already cost taxpayers $5.3 billion in reimbursements to utilities for on-site storage, with future liability projected to be between $29 billion and $50 billion. Stranded assets from early plant closures could add another $60 billion in liabilities. The SMR supply chain also seems fragile and dependent on foreign nations. Over 90% of U.S. uranium fuel is imported, and there are no significant domestic suppliers for key materials like Hafnium, Niobium, and Nickel. 

Lastly, when you look at where major data centers are (Northern Virginia, Phoenix, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago), these aren't in the middle of nowhere; they are major urban areas. Do you think there won't be massive NIMBYism and regulatory efforts to halt small nuclear plants in these areas? 

&nbsp;

**4: I Just Dont get it**

When you look at the market, it seems SMRs are a non-competitive technology being outpaced by cheaper, faster, and more scalable solutions. From 2011 to 2021, the world added 56 gigawatts of nuclear capacity. In the single year of 2023, the world added 510 gigawatts of renewable capacity. For 2024, renewables accounted for 92.5% of all new global power capacity, and for 2025, solar, wind, and batteries represent 93% of planned U.S. utility-scale capacity additions. 0% is nuclear.

Nuclear's share of global power generation peaked at 17% in the mid-1990s and fell to 9.1% by 2024. If projections hold, solar will generate more electricity than nuclear by next year. Meanwhile things like advanced geothermal are projected to provide baseload power at a capital cost of $4,500 per kilowatt by 2030, eroding the nuclear is the only scalable renewable baseload argument.

Major catalysts include the successful completion of Phase II enrollment for a cancer drug and, critically, promising Phase III data for BOTRESO and the intention to refile an NDA for a urological botanical drug targeting a multi-billion dollar market. This progression towards commercialization, combined with a recent $20 million IPO, new 52-week highs, and institutional interest from firms like Citadel, indicates strong market anticipation for pipeline success. Technicals show an upward trend despite high volatility, with the price currently above key moving averages. However, the severe financial fragility introduces substantial risk, making this a low-confidence good buy driven purely by potential future drug approval and commercialization.” - AI tool I’ve been using

I think this could potentially be an insane return, it’s a very risky play but putting some money into the stock could pay off heavily.

Has anyone studied Free Cash Flow Yield? What is the general principle for a benchmark or a range that is attractive? Terry Smith has a video explaining his firm's philosophy here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiZQqe-3RKA&pp=ygUUZnJlZSBjYXNoIGZsb3cgeWllbGQ%3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiZQqe-3RKA&pp=ygUUZnJlZSBjYXNoIGZsb3cgeWllbGQ%3D)

Obivously you can never look at one metric and everything needs to be in context, for example if a company is heavily levered most of that free cash flow yield should be reserved for debt repayments while a low levered company cash either distribute back to shareholders or re-invest into the business. I really enjoy looking at simply Debt/Free Cash Flow.

1nnxe6i,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 16:19:30,Intel’s Nvidia Lifeline - Desperate Wager or Stroke of Genius?,"The big news is the alliance between Intel and NVIDIA. NVIDIA is pumping $5 billion into Intel, sending the stock soaring while AMD's took a hit. For Intel, it's a desperately needed lifeline into the AI data centre space. For NVIDIA, it's a strategic hedge against relying solely on Taiwan's TSMC and a way to win political points with Washington. AMD is now caught in the crossfire, facing a new competitor attacking it on both the CPU and GPU fronts.

But this deal doesn't fix Intel's core problem: its grand plan to become a contract chip maker (a ""foundry"") is in deep trouble. The company's own SEC filings bluntly admit they have been ""unsuccessful to date in attracting significant customers"".

So, everything now hinges on one massive bet: their next-generation 18A manufacturing process. This tech is genuinely revolutionary, with new ""RibbonFET"" transistors and ""PowerVia"" backside power delivery that could, in theory, leapfrog TSMC's upcoming N2 node. Microsoft has given them a huge vote of confidence by signing on to use 18A, but the stakes couldn't be higher.

The bear case is terrifying: persistent rumours of alarmingly low manufacturing yields (some as low as 10%) could kill the entire strategy before it begins. Meanwhile, Intel is still bleeding market share to AMD in its core CPU business and is a distant third in the AI chip race, where NVIDIA's software moat is almost impossible to overcome.

My take? Investing in Intel today is a venture capital-style bet on a single, binary outcome. If they can execute flawlessly and get 18A working at scale by 2025, the stock is extraordinarily cheap. If they stumble, the decline could be terminal. It's a high-risk, high-reward play for the brave.

Mark Spitznagel’s hedge fund has earned bonanzas in market collapses

This is an online version of Spencer’s Markets A.M. newsletter. Get investing insights in your inbox each weekday by signing up here—it’s free.

Plenty of fund managers will tell you they’re really bullish about stocks. Try finding one who says so yet stands to make a killing if prices collapse.

“I’m the crash guy—I remain the crash guy,” says Mark Spitznagel, who earned $1 billion in a single day for his clients during 2015’s “Flash Crash.” A protégé of “Black Swan” author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, his hedge fund, Universa Investments, also scored major gains when Lehman collapsed and when Covid-19 sparked a meltdown.

The alarming part of Spitznagel’s current outlook is that he sees conditions akin to 1929, the year of the Wall Street crash. The silver lining for those hoping the bull-market music will keep playing a while longer: He thinks this is more like the early part of 1929 when stocks added significantly to their Roaring ’20s gains.

How excited—or worried—should ordinary investors be? Take a deep breath and understand the way Spitznagel made those past killings. He wasn’t reading the tea leaves and predicting the timing of stock swoons. Even the smartest trader couldn’t know a pandemic or trading glitch was coming. Universa buys so-called tail-risk protection that loses money most of the time and then pays off hugely if a downturn is particularly sharp.

Other successful fund managers have drawn public attention with similar calls, and they occasionally get them right. In July 2024 Spitznagel himself sounded a similar tune, predicting “something really, really bad,” but with a last hurrah for stocks first. The S&P 500 has gained 23% since 

Market timing is notoriously difficult and often costly for individual investors who shift their portfolios on fearful headlines—something Spitznagel pointedly doesn’t recommend. Individuals who can’t buy sophisticated tail-risk protection will still make attractive returns in the long run as long as they can hang on. Many don’t.

“The biggest risk to investors isn’t the market—it’s themselves,” he says.

Timing aside, the euphoric and then cataclysmic scenario Spitznagel is describing could be good for his particular strategy. When investors are optimistic, his fund can purchase exotic tail-risk derivatives cheaply. His clients, mostly traditional investors such as pension funds, pay for protection so that they can more confidently reap the full benefit of rising markets.

The reason Spitznagel thinks the current bull market’s comeuppance could be the worst since 1929 is repeated federal rescues of markets and the economy. He compares it to the practice of quickly extinguishing forest fires only to have too much dry tinder accumulate. Amid today’s near-record stock valuations, the eventual “firebomb” could burn 

Before that happens, though, he calls conditions such as Federal Reserve rate cuts ideal for the market to push higher, with the S&P 500 hitting 8000 points fairly quickly. That would be a 20% gain from today’s level.

If a major selloff really is just over the horizon, big gains now wouldn’t be unusual. Since 1980, the S&P 500 has returned an impressive 26% annualized in the 12 months preceding the start of a bear market. The final 12 months’ rally was more than twice as high as that average ahead of the 1929 peak.

Both individual and professional investors tend to increase their stock exposure at times like today. Strategists at State Street noted last month that institutional investors’ exposure to equities just reached its highest since November 2007, just before a vicious bear market. American households’ allocation to stocks is also at a record, surpassing tech-bubble levels.

Two other signs that investors are throwing caution to the wind: The premium investors require to own investment-grade-rated bonds hit its lowest since 1998 on Friday and trading volume on U.S. stock exchanges was just shy of the April record during the Liberation Day panic.

“The markets are perverse,” says Spitznagel. “They exist to screw people.”

1nnmqwm,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 09:38:43,The great ammunition liquidation has ended (plus one more investment theme to start the week),"Note: formatting is much better on the website.

\---

# Theme 1: Ammunition Industry Pricing Power Returns After Historic 2025 Collapse

**News:** Kinetic Group, owner of Federal, CCI, Speer, Remington, and other major ammunition brands, announced substantial price increases of 3-12% across all ammunition categories effective October 1, 2025, citing rising costs of brass, lead, antimony, and propellants.

**Investment Thesis:** The first major ammunition price increase announcement signals the end of 2025's historic price collapse, creating margin recovery opportunities for manufacturers after months of unsustainable pricing.

The ammunition market experienced an unprecedented collapse throughout 2025, with 9mm rounds falling 75% from pandemic highs to just 20 cents per round, and current prices sitting 35% below pre-pandemic 2019 levels. This dramatic decline was driven by oversupply from pre-tariff imports, reduced post-election demand, and economic pressures on consumer spending.

Kinetic Group's announcement represents a fundamental shift in market dynamics. When the largest player in the ammunition market implements broad-based price increases, it typically sets the tone for industry-wide pricing adjustments. The company's rationale of rising raw material costs suggests that the artificial oversupply conditions are normalizing.

The timing creates additional advantages for manufacturers, as they can sell existing lower-cost inventory at higher prices while benefiting from the approaching hunting season demand. With warehouses currently full and retailers heavily discounting to clear inventory, this price increase signals that the liquidation phase may be ending.

**Stocks that would benefit:**

• `SWBI`: Smith & Wesson Brands Inc - While primarily known for firearms, Smith & Wesson has strategically diversified into ammunition production to capture more of the shooting sports ecosystem. The company is uniquely positioned to benefit from ammunition price normalization through both direct margin improvement in its ammunition segment and increased firearm sales as ammunition becomes more affordable, encouraging more frequent shooting and training. Smith & Wesson's vertically integrated business model allows it to capitalize on both sides of the market recovery, with its strong brand recognition driving consumer loyalty across product categories during this pricing inflection point. 

• `RGR`: Sturm, Ruger & Company Inc - As a pure-play firearms manufacturer with a debt-free balance sheet, Ruger stands to benefit significantly from the normalization of ammunition prices through increased firearm demand. When ammunition becomes more affordable, consumers typically increase their shooting activities, driving both new gun purchases and replacement cycles. Ruger's recent strategic product innovations, including versatile platforms like the RXM pistol and successful Marlin lever-action rifles, position the company to capture increased consumer spending as the ammunition price barrier to shooting sports participation decreases, directly supporting the pricing power recovery thesis. 

# Theme 2: EV Charging Infrastructure Gains Momentum from Wood Mackenzie's Bullish 12.3% Growth Forecast

**News:** Wood Mackenzie released comprehensive research projecting global EV charging ports will expand at a 12.3% compound annual growth rate from 2026 through 2040, reaching 206.6 million ports worldwide, with annual infrastructure investment growing 8% annually to $300 billion by 2040.

**Investment Thesis:** EV charging infrastructure companies are entering a sustained expansion cycle driven by improving utilization economics and U.S. market outperformance expectations of 14% annual growth through 2040.

The Wood Mackenzie forecast validates long-term business models across the charging ecosystem, particularly highlighting that the ratio of EVs to public chargers will improve from 7.5 vehicles per charger in 2025 to 14.2 in 2040. This utilization improvement directly addresses previous investor concerns about charging network economics and return on invested capital.

The U.S. market specifically is projected to outpace global growth, reaching 475,000 ports and generating $3.3 billion in annual market value by 2040. This domestic outperformance creates particular advantages for American-listed charging infrastructure companies.

Residential charging dominance continues with 133 million ports expected globally by 2040, representing two-thirds of all installations through 2050, supporting companies focused on Level 2 residential solutions alongside public fast-charging networks.

**Stocks that would benefit:**

• `EVGO`: EVgo Inc - Positioned as a pure-play beneficiary of the improving EV charging economics highlighted in the Wood Mackenzie forecast, particularly the projected increase in the ratio of EVs to public chargers from 7.5 to 14.2 by 2040. EVgo's strategic focus on high-power DC fast charging in urban and suburban locations directly aligns with the projected 14% annual growth in the U.S. market. The company's recent non-dilutive financing, including a $1.25 billion DOE loan and $225 million commercial bank facility, provides the capital needed to expand its public stall count to approximately 14,000 by 2029, capturing significant market share during this growth phase. EVgo's joint development of next-generation charging architecture with Delta Electronics, targeting a 30% reduction in gross CapEx per stall, further enhances its ability to benefit from the projected market expansion. 

• `BLNK`: Blink Charging Co - Uniquely positioned to capitalize on both the residential and commercial charging expansion projected in the Wood Mackenzie report through its vertically integrated business model. The company's strategic shift toward a higher-margin, recurring service revenue model emphasizes ownership and operation of charging assets, particularly DC fast chargers, which aligns perfectly with the forecast's emphasis on improving utilization economics. Blink's proprietary network technology and vertical integration capabilities enable it to enhance operational performance and improve station economics as the market expands. The company's recent 35% year-over-year growth in charging service revenue demonstrates increasing utilization and network expansion, directly supporting the thesis that charging economics will improve as EV adoption accelerates.

• `CHPT`: ChargePoint Holdings - Offers comprehensive charging solutions across residential, commercial, and fleet segments, making it a diversified play on the projected expansion across all charging environments. The company's software platform and hardware innovations are particularly well-positioned to benefit from the forecast's projection that residential charging will represent two-thirds of all installations through 2050. ChargePoint's strategic partnerships with companies like Eaton and General Motors accelerate product development and expand market reach, particularly for advanced energy management solutions like bidirectional charging. The company's record non-GAAP gross margin of 33% demonstrates improving economics that align with the Wood Mackenzie forecast's projection of better utilization rates and return on invested capital for charging infrastructure.

1nnmapb,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 09:20:03,Is catalyst pharmaceutical a good value buy?,"
Been looking at Catalyst Pharma (CPRX) and ran it through my scoring model. Came out pretty strong (84/100). Quick breakdown: All data from stock analysis.com

What looks good:

Margins are insane → ~83% gross, 37% net. 

ROIC ~21% → solid efficiency.

Zero debt + $650m cash → balance sheet is rock solid.

Free cash flow margin ~49% → very rare for a small biotech.

EPS growth forecast ~26% over 5 years.

Analysts are bullish → avg PT around $33 (that’s ~+68% upside).

Patent protection on their main drug (Firdapse) extended until 2035.


What bothers me:

PEG ratio ~1.3 → not dirt cheap anymore.

Revenue growth forecast is only ~11% → not huge 🤔

Still heavily dependent on one drug → if anything goes wrong, revenue takes a hit.

Generic/legal risk always a cloud in pharma.

Execution risk with their newer drugs (AGAMREE, FYCOMPA).


My view:
CPRX feels like a proper cash cow with limited downside, but the growth story depends on them scaling beyond Firdapse. If there's no future successful drugs released, you’ve basically bought into a super profitable but not fast-growing rare-disease niche.

Curious if anyone else is in CPRX",3,4,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nnmapb/is_catalyst_pharmaceutical_a_good_value_buy/,new,Discussion,1.0

1nnk79x,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 07:44:34,Why Japanese Real Estate Small Caps Might Be the Best Value in Global Markets Right Now,"The Japanese stock market has finally climbed back to the highs it set during one of the largest financial bubbles in history (the 1980s). After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

⸻

Bottom line:
Japanese real estate small caps are a rare mix of hyper-growth, low valuations, insider ownership, and secular tailwinds.

1nnh3jp,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 04:40:37,The grain trader that’s hated right now (ADM),"I am talking about Archer Daniel Midland, one of the largest grain and soft commodity traders out there. This stock has taken a beating the last 2 years, when it had an investigation into accounting practices and suspended their CFO. Things have not looked good for their stock price since. However, their cashflows have been very solid in the last few years and this is why I suggest there might be value in this stock. As of today, the market cap is roughly 80 billion USD.

Firstly, their business model mainly consists of procurement, storage, blending and transportation of oilseeds and grains as well as crushing them into meal and oil products. These two pillars are accounting for two thirds of their profits. The rest is refinement and distribution of bulk and package food oils and biodiesel and a 22% ownership Wilmar that has a diversified portfolio and is accounted for at equity. Their processing plants are mainly in the US. According to CSI Market, their market share depending on the product is somewhere between 30-40%. Their operating margins however are quite low, since they are a trader and not a producer, they dont own the farm land. So you will see a low margin in their business and volatility in their earnings depending on the underlying price movements. Their moat is their sheer size and the cost efficiencies they can achieve compared to the competition.

From their financials, I think this company draws a different picture than their stock price suggests. Their operating cashflow has been massive in the latest quarter at 4 billion USD, which is very solid compared to total assets of around 50 billion USD. They generated good cashflow over the last 3 years with consistent quarterly cashflows in the region of 1-3 billion USD, the only quarter being negative back in March 2023.

Looking at the balance sheet, they do have liabilities (the business is capital intensive to some degree, to buy machinery etc.), but they have a very healthy level of equity. As for shares outstanding, they have constantly decreased over the last quarters as well as over the last 10 years, to me a good sign that you wont get diluted.

Overall, the cashflows can be a bit over the place and sensitive to macro events, i think this is still a player to keep in mind, given the discount the stock price has compared to a few years back.

Insider trades do give some mixed signals, since the CFO has sold some shares a few months back worth 1.3 MUSD (see below), but this does not have me worried too much.

For this analysis I used charts over the quarterly and annual financial results (balance sheet, income statement, cashflow statement and shares outstanding) that are official submissions to the SEC and i have obtained them through [www.Stock-Ticker-News.com](http://www.Stock-Ticker-News.com)

The valuation is too high for me but I know it’s an excellent business, so I put it on my watchlist.

1nn08ij,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 14:52:51,$ALT. Many catalysts create a favorable risk/reward setup... (A Write Up),"**Disclosure:**  
First off, I want to be clear, I did use ChatGPT to help me reword and structure this write-up. **This is not “AI slop.”** I’ve done my own due diligence on $ALT, reviewed the trial data, filings, and peer comparisons. I merely used it as a tool for formatting and clarity. Also, **I do have a position in $ALT** and recommend you do your own due diligence before investing.

**Thesis**

Altimmune ($ALT) with its lead asset **permvidutide** is delivering on multiple ways in **obesity**, MASH (metabolic associated steatohepatitis), and liver disease. The recent 24-week data, non-invasive (NIT) improvements, regulatory developments, tolerability profile, obesity weight loss, recent management additions, and high short interest all create a short-term favorable risk/reward setup which should play out within the next year (when 48 week data releases end of this year/early next year). Also an **incredible opportunity for an acquisition**. 



**1. Mechanism & Design**

Pemvidutide is a GLP-1 / glucagon dual agonist engineered with Altimmune's EuPort domain. This deisng extends its half-life, reduces peak exposure, which enables therapeutic doses (1.2 mg, 1.8 mg) to be used without titration, improving usability for patients and physicians.

**(Simplified)** It's like Ozempic but built better - it lasts longer, its smoother on the body, and doesn't slow dose increases. 



**2. 24-Week MASH Data**

In the IMPACT Phase 2b trial, pemvidutide achieved MASH resolution without worsening fibrosis in       52-59% of patients vs \~19% placebo (p<0.0001). Fibrosis improvements trended positive (32-35% vs 25% placebo) but wasn't statistically significant at 24 weeks. 

**(Simplified)** After 6 months, more than half the patients had their liver disease clear up, compared to only 1 in 5 on placebo. Scarring wasn't improved enough yet, but it looks to be moving in the right direction. 



**3. Non-Invasive Tests (NITs)**

Significant improvements were seen on non-invasive fibrosis and liver-stiffness measures (VCTE, ELF), consistent with FDA's move to recognize VCTE as a ""reasonably likely"" surrogate endpoint. 

**(Simplified)** Scans and blood tests showed the drug was working. The FDA now says these kinds of scans can count as proof of a drug works.



**4. Weight Loss in the MASH Trial**  

At 24 weeks, pemvidutide delivered \~5-6% mean weight loss without titration, with body weight still declining at the last observation.

**(Simplified)** People lost about 5-6% of their body weight in 6 months - and they were still losing more when the study ended. 

  


**5. Safety & Tolerability** 

Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were <1% on pemvidutide, lower than placebo. EuPort design may contribute to reduced GI side effects.

**(Simplified)** Almost nobody quit because of side effects - actually fewer than those on placebo. 



**6. Obesity Program (MOMENTUM)**

In obesity, Phase 2, 2.4 mg pemvitutide produced 15.6% mean weight loss at 48 weeks with minimal titration. Lean mass loss was \~22% of weight lost, while visceral fat reduction was \~28%, outperforming subcutaneous loss and looking favorable vs other GLP-1s. 

**(Simplified)**  In a year-long obesity trial, patients lost about 16% of their weight. Most of that was fat, especially belly fat, and they kept more muscle compared to other weight-loss drugs. 

  


**7. Pipeline Expansion**  
Altimmune has initiated Phase 2 studies of pemvidutide in Alcohol Use Disorder (heavy drinking days) and Alchohol-Associated Liver Disease (endpoint: VCTE at 24 weeks). 

**(Simplified)** The drug is also being tested to help people drink less and to treat alcohol-related liver disease. 

  


**8. Valuation & Peer Context**  
Altimmune's valuation (\~$330M market cap, \~$170M EV) remains anomalously low compared with peers, especially following Roche's $2.4B acquistion of 89bio. 

**(Simplified)** Self explanatory...  




**9. Regulatory/Surrogate Endpoints**

FDA's acceptance of a Letter of Intent to qualify VCTE as the first non-invasive surrogate endpoint ""reasonably likely to predict benefit"" enhance the regulatory pathway for pemvidutide. 

**(Simplified)** The FDA now allows certain scans to be used as proof in trials, which makes Altimmune's results even more valuable. 

  


**10. Short Interest Details**

Shares sold short \~26.77 millions shares 

Short % of flat \~30.55-31.7%

This is high short interest. It means many are betting against ALT, which could amplify volatility around catalysts like data readouts, regulatory decisions, earnings. 

  


**11. New Management**

Altimmune appointed Linda M. Richardson as Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), effective September 16, 2025. Richardson brings over 30 years of commerical leadership across metabolic disease, hepatology, cardiovascular, and addiction medicine, with prior C-suite experience at Intercept and senior roles at Sanofi. The timing of this is pivotal 48-week MASH data readout and Phase 3 planning and signals that Altimmune is preparing for commercial execution. Hiring a CCO at this stage suggests confidence in trial outcomes, intent to scale infrastructure for Phase 3, and a focus on market access and launch strategy. 

  
Hope you all enjoyed and recommend you do your own DD before making any financial decision.

1nm5s9p,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 14:31:31,Unprofitable stocks are often the BEST value plays.,"I see a lot of people write off companies the second they see **“unprofitable.”** But that seems foolish to me.

Often when a company is unprofitable, the stock looks insanely overvalued on traditional metrics. But *IF* it has a clear path to profitability it might be a good buy. As once profits start coming in, suddenly valuation looks “reasonable.” Therefore the stock rerates higher.

**Examples:**

* PLTR
* HIMS
* UBER
* CVNA
* HOOD
* SOFI
* SHOP
* (and probably more)

All were ""expensive"" when the stock was unprofitable. But after profitability they got rerated higher.

Obviously most unprofitable companies never make it and burn capital forever. **That's why I believe if I were to bet on an unprofitable company it'll be software companies.** As they're highly scalable and are the most likely to do a profitability turnaround. And they're profits need to be heading up.

**Curious how this sub views it:**

Is this outside of value investing, or is it value?

One can say they’re just looking for good deals in the market. Either by ownership, or lending. They understand that the market is valued correctly in the long term, hence in the short term there are discrepancies, or gaps in the market, that they can take advantage of in many shapes or form. But there are two main components that play a key role.


The price the investor buys at, and the value they approximately predict of the security they are buying. Typically the intrinsic value, the bet on future earnings based on the assets tangible and intangible of the present. The assets a business owns will be the primary driver of growth and earnings, and an investor main goal is to find securities that have assets that provide strong earning powers in the future. This is the value, now in the short term, investor sentiment, aka the optimism or pessimism of “Mr. Market” is in constant fluctuations. So the intrinsic value and the present day price of the security often do not correspond. And some are seriously undervalued, those provide a margin of safety, with a significant discount rate. This is the ideal security an investor wants and hunts for.",2,4,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nln59x/why_value_investing_is_fundamentally_market_price/,new,Discussion,0.75

Is it value investing to invest in unorthodox companies that are surviving crisis, bankruptcy, restructuration, and very shaky past ?  
  
In Brazil there are some companies that although are or were in huge crisis, they have some good value, like:

* Light Company: It's the electrical company of Rio de Janeiro, it was in our Chapter 11 and judicial recovery, it had a huge debt, it's also well known in the market that 60% of the energy generated and transmitted by the company is hotwired and stolen by the inhabitants, pratically they are a joke amongst the people. Nevertheless, today they are in a very better situation, their leverage is good compared to other electrical companies, they have some good cash flow, big shots of the market investing, Small P/E, and the energy supply of the entire Rio de Janeiro State, but the market is still undervaluing the stock. 
* Lojas Americanas: It's our Dollar General, and punchline of hundreds of jokes amongst the population, due to it's recent fraud scandal, judicial recovery, litigations, stories of shoplifting, etc However the owners (3g Capital of AbInbev, BurgerKing) were forced to captalize and save the company. today the company is still recovering, but there is some potential like: personal intervention of the owners (Mr Sicupira, Lemann and Telles), small debt, huge capital injection, a reducing loss, and it's huge presence in Brazil's Retail and logistics, that still provide them competitive advantage in the sale of snacks, underwear, electronics, alongside digital presence, and a possibility of interest rate reducing in the future. Although the company is a meme stock in the stock market.
* Magalu: it's our Best Buy+IKEA, and the main Amazon + Mercado Livre rival in the country, it was in a bad shape last years, it also got in trouble with our basic interest rate, and debt, it's stock plummeted. However it seems to be back on the track, they are recovering from losses, their debt is also reduced, they have huge cash flow, are a HUGE brand in the market, their logistics is second to none, they are also undervalued in regards to their equity, and believe or not the company is diversifying in the cloud sector.

1nl8pby,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 12:45:00,I believe this is the most future proof mine I've ever found,"
Alright listen up gang, I’ve found a beat down stock but what I think is a sure hit for mid to long term investors.  FPX nickel is building the largest nickel mine in north American, top 10 in the world.

To break this down, here’s a few of the key bull points

-The ore does not require acid extraction, it uses magnets (fucken magnets, how do they work?)

-The ore type means is low carbon footprint, low tailings, and low metallurgical cost, it’s a simple extraction method. Low carbon is favorable as  future proofed mine. The capital cost per extraction is quite ideal

-it’s in BC Canada which is favorable for mining, good port access and intercontinental sales

-It can be processed as either high grade nickel for stainless steel, or pushed to battery grade nickel sulphate

-They received $3.5 million CAD from the Canadian government to support construction. This is not a loan, literally just free money to the company

-They have three separate companies who all have bought a share in FPX and all the company’s have a cost basis of around 40 to 50 cents (share price is 30 cents now)

-They have preliminary agreements with Toyota and panasonic, Japan’s metal and energy security agency, and Prime planet energy & solutions to supply materials for EV construction (non binding). These will align the industries for future partnerships, funding agreements, and general support overseas

-It’s mine life is 29 years.
 
What’s the downside and risk?
It’s early stages, Environmental assessments have been happening since 2022, but permitting might take as long as 2027. Nickel might not be sold until as late as 2030


So with that said, this is a long term investment. Dont expect fast returns and big moves soon, but for the patient investor, this could really pay off

1nkz7ha,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 05:46:57,"Malibu Life Holdings (LON:MLHL) Trading at Huge Discount. Price $20, Book $33+.","Malibu Life Holdings (LON:MLHL) used to be that Third Point Investors Limited was just one of those London-listed closed end funds that gave you exposure to Dan Loeb’s hedge fund strategy via a feeder structure. It traded at a persistent discount to its net asset value, leaving a lot of investors frustrated. Recently, it pivoted with a reverse takeover and transformed itself into an operating reinsurer focused on US fixed annuities. That’s the change. The upcoming opportunity lies in how that restructured business can begin to deliver growth, profits, and get re-rated by the market.

As of now, the volume of shares traded have taken a nosedive since the reverse take over given the reassessment taking place by all institution investors. Furthermore, the company has yet to release it's first quarterly and annual reports since the merger, however, based on the financials reported during the reverse takeover, we can work somethings out. In addition to this, liquidity has also been impacted by the scheduled redemption of 4.38 million shares on 19 September 2025, with initial cash consideration paid that day. After the redemption the free float drops to roughly 17 million shares, which has further thinned day-to-day volumes and made price discovery more volatile. The redemption also took place at a slight discount, meaning the NAV per share should slightly tick up, but we can ignore that bit for now.

The latest numbers tell us that the reference NAV per ordinary share is about \~$33 as of the last disclosure date. The company’s share price is currently trading near $20-21 depending on market moves. The tangible book value of Malibu Life Reinsurance (the acquired business) is roughly US$65-68 million. However, since this was an NAV-to-NAV deal, this won't impact the PB per share.

Putting those together, the implied book value (NAV) per share is $33, while the market is paying around $20. That means the shares are trading at about a 40-45% discount to book value (or NAV). That is a large margin of safety if the book value is sound, and if the reinsurance business can begin to show results.

Risks remain. Execution risk is high: building up premium volume, managing reserves, ensuring profitability in the reinsurance of US fixed annuities is not trivial. Regulatory risk exists if oversight or capital requirements change. There is also the possibility the discount persists or widens if the market is skeptical of management, of the reinsurance strategy, or if early operating results are weak. Liquidity and investor sentiment matter.

Assuming the business executes reasonably well, sells enough treaties or annuity blocks, and begins to deliver mid-teens returns on equity (the stated target), one can model a re-rating of the share price over a 1-2 year horizon. If today’s NAV is \~$33 and the market is paying \~$20, the discount will need to narrow substantially for the share price to catch up. If discount narrows to, say, 10-15%, that alone gives \~25-30% upside (to \~$28-30). Add in NAV growth from earnings (assuming 10-15% ROE, growth in premium base, operational leverage) and you might see NAV rise to perhaps \~$36-40 in 12-24 months. Combined with discount compression that gives a potential price target in the ballpark of US$32-$40 per share.

Given that, a fair one-to-two year price target I would propose is US$35 per share under base case, US$40 per share if execution is strong and re-rating occurs.",52,3,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkz7ha/malibu_life_holdings_lonmlhl_trading_at_huge/,new,Stock Analysis,0.97

* I'm relatively a newborn in stockmarket and value investing, effectively starting in late september of last year. And i started very bad, investing on **NVDA** bubble and quitting once i got the opportunity, and i learned more about the market,  fundamental attributes, fundamental analysis.
* I'm in a very *sui generis* market, the brazilian one, where the stock market is underinvested and a bit smaller than the american one, the investors are either too skeptical or too optimistical, with elephant companies with very low P/E ratio, healthy finances and big fat dividends (like 15% in some banks, oil, mining).
* Since NVDA i've been building a small portifolio, following the principles of: absolute frugality in the stock price (small P/E like Vale and Petrobras), very good growth prospects, no bubbles nor Rallies, undervalued good companies (like Oil, Insurance, Banks), that suffered devaluation due to market rumors, bad season and the infamous tariffs.
* I avoided to buy NVO, due to lack of time to study, fear of catching a falling Knive, the targeting of Ozempic Patents by brazilian and world pharma (lots of companies are crazy to make their own, it's going to be a fever here, unfortunately lots of the producers are private)
* I also avoided Google, due to the worsening of the flagship product (search platform), bullish approach to AI, the fierce competion in cloud providers, the insane approach of US government, the recession on the radar, and a P/E of 25
* Nonetheless, NVO is starting to get impulse and is a nice company to invest (their brand is differential).
* And Google even though i disagree with some choices, they have Youtube (This itself is a huge product, a monopoly), Google, Waymo, GCP, and strong R&D

A rally is forming about these two companies, in a market that is craving to buy the deep and is almost bubble generator,  
And i'm thinking about getting a few shares of NVO and GOOGL, but i'm afraid of paying a very expensive price, what's the best approach to this case ?

## CONCLUSION & VERIFICATION SUMMARY

### Macro Regime Classification
**Primary Regime:** TRANSITIONING (EXPANSION → SLOWDOWN)
**Confidence Level:** HIGH
**Expected Duration:** 6-9 months
**Key Supporting Evidence:**
1. Fed pivot to easing with first rate cut
2. Labor market deterioration (NFP miss, rising unemployment)
3. Yield curve normalization after extended inversion

### Executive Summary
**One-Line Synthesis:** The macro environment is transitioning from late-cycle expansion to early slowdown, with the Fed initiating an easing cycle that should provide selective opportunities in duration and quality risk assets while warranting caution on cyclical exposures.

### Highest Conviction Calls

1. **Long Investment Grade Bonds**
   - Supporting data: 4%+ yields with Fed easing, tight spreads
   - Implementation: Overweight IG via LQD or individual bonds
   - Risk: Spread widening if recession materializes

2. **Overweight Quality Growth Equities**
   - Supporting data: Rate cuts historically benefit growth, strong fundamentals
   - Implementation: Technology and healthcare sector ETFs
   - Risk: Valuation compression if rates rise unexpectedly

3. **Reduce Cyclical Exposure**
   - Supporting data: ISM <50, weak NFP, global growth concerns
   - Implementation: Underweight energy, materials, industrials
   - Risk: Positive economic surprise could cause underperformance

### Key Risks to Monitor
1. **Inflation reacceleration:** Trigger at CPI >3.5%, currently at 2.9%
2. **Credit event:** Trigger at HY spreads >450bps, currently at 283bps
3. **Labor market breakdown:** Trigger at unemployment >4.5%, currently at 4.3%

### Next Update Requirements
- **Scheduled Update:** October 18, 2025
- **Conditional Update:** If Fed makes inter-meeting move or CPI >3.5%
- **Emergency Update:** If VIX >30 or credit spreads blow out >100bps

Fundamentals (Ok - kinda solid): Good balance sheet (solid liquidity ratios + recovering solvency such as debt ratios), not great but ok looking income statement (EBITDA&net profit margin still trying to recover + still decreasing ROIC and ROE but still solid numbers), Cashflow statement doesn't look too great but I can see they are (1. laying low on CAPEX just maintaining and not investing into PPE; 2. Paying back shareholders) - exactly what a mature stage company should do. So overall, the fundamentals don't look bad to me.

2. Overarching Headwind (Nothing to be feared): I think this headwind is nothing to be feared as its gonna pass. People needs their stuff shipped, simple as that. And the orange king won't be in power forever. ( so I have AMZN + FDX shares & sold puts on UPS)

3. Valuation: A solid business trading at 13x earnings is a no brainer to me.

My execution: I started a position with 10% of my NAV and plans to hold if it goes up or convert half into LEAPS if the earnings blew up.

The Golden Age of Value Investing Is Over

It used to take hard work and an ear for scuttlebutt to gain an edge, but now AI has leveled the playing field. Is that a bad thing? 

For 30 years, my advantage as an investor was painstaking research. AI just made it worthless.
In 1995, I read two books that changed my life: Benjamin Graham’s The Intelligent Investor and Roger Lowenstein’s biography of Warren Buffett. I was hooked on value investing. I could not get enough of it. In those days, however, getting enough of it was hard. It was the infancy of the internet, so it wasn’t as if I could just Google “Warren Buffett” or “value investing.”


The first thing I could get my hands on was Berkshire Hathaway’s annual report. I had to look up the phone number in the phone directory. After that, I placed a phone call using a landline. A nice lady with a Midwestern accent picked up the phone, “Berkshire Hathaway — how can I help you?”


“Hello,” I said. “I’d like to order a copy of your annual report.” That’ll be no problem, came the answer. I gave her my mailing address, and she repeated it back to me. A few days later, I received a brown envelope with the annual report. I devoured it. And I used the table of Berkshire’s publicly traded investments to go after new materials — the reports of Coca-Cola, Geico, American Express and Capital Cities/ABC — in a similar fashion, by picking up a landline phone and making a verbal request.
What’s my point?


Things went slowly. Acquiring knowledge was hard. Every step in the acquisition of investing knowledge involved a cycle of days, if not weeks. The various pieces had to be carefully assembled and assiduously harvested.


From those early days, I learned about the Berkshire Hathaway meetings. They were not recorded for YouTube or televised live. So, I acquired some shares and attended them in person. All in pursuit of an investing edge. Yes — there were a few lucky non-attendees of those meetings who managed to get onto Whitney Tilson’s famous email list — which at the time numbered dozens at most. But that was it. The inside tracks were few and far between.
Because I could not get enough, I also attended the Wesco meetings in Pasadena, California with Charlie Munger, and the Sequoia Fund meetings run by Bill Ruane and Rick Cunniff. Once at the Wesco meeting, Munger mentioned the Tupperware company in the context of Robert Cialdini’s Influence:The Psychology of Persuasion. I was on it. I even organized a Tupperware party in my home to understand how the company’s sales system worked.


In those days, potential investors in my fund used to ask, “What’s your edge?” Perhaps it was a shorthand for “Do you have a source of inside information?” Or, more politely, “What’s your variant insight?” If I had any at all, it was based on this sort of scuttlebutt.
But that world is now gone.


Over the last decade many of those advantages have been eroded. Pounding the pavement, smiling and dialing were no longer necessary. Because those hard-earned insights were being emailed, tweeted, livestreamed, YouTubed, podcasted and more. Yes, you still had to pick your sources. But there was so much more that was simply available at the tips of any analyst’s fingers.


And now comes AI. The way investment research changed in the internet age was glacially slow when compared to the earthquake that is LLMs. Before ChatGPT, you still had to have the patience to assemble and read through the mosaic of sources. Now you can just ask ChatGPT or Gemini to do all the trawling. An LLM can give an instant summary of all that has been said in the public domain about a company. And it can be instantly analyzed to provide the current state of wisdom on the topic.
Granted, the LLMs cannot, to the best of my knowledge, generate original thinking. But the path to original thoughts is so much shorter — and so much more accessible.


In past times, I used to make a point of traveling to the Kings Road in London on the off chance that Nick Sleep and Qais Zakaria of Nomad might treat me to a Cornish pasty along with some of their original thoughts. It was there that I first heard Nick talk about “scale economies shared.” Today there is no need for me to travel all that distance — unless I am only after the Cornish pasty and Nick and Zak’s fine company.


Why? So many original thoughts or variant opinions are available online and the LLMs can trawl through all of them — adding in and cross-referencing a mosaic of additional sources: social media posts, SEC filings and more. That material is all now public domain.


It’s true that there are still many nonpublic data sources that are not accessible by LLMs. But data tends to leak out via Scribd, Reddit, arXiv or social media. Even if that’s just metadata, it can be assembled effortlessly. Then a human like me can apply intuition and fact-check the sources to make sure the LLM is not hallucinating.


What does this mean for value investing?
My conclusion is that the golden age of value investing is well and truly over. Thanks to the LLMs, I have no need for a junior analyst: At a fraction of the cost, an LLM can do a far better job. And the era of the swashbuckling hedge fund manager — Michael Steinhardt, George Soros, Julian Robertson — is also gone.


Asset pricing will become more accurate. Hidden subtleties about a particular business that make it either better or worse than it appears will be more easily revealed. The return on better analysis and better insight will diminish because it will be available to all. The British scientist and writer Matt Ridley would liken this to the Red Queen effect: We can all run faster, but at the end of the day, we will all have access to the same LLMs. The dispersion of returns for active management has to reduce, clustering even closer to the index return, even for investors who don’t closet index.


People used to ask, “What’s your edge?”, but there is no edge anymore. At least, none that is obvious to me.


Where, then, will money flow? What remains are index funds and asset-gatherers like BlackRock. And what of small, independent boutique funds like mine? We can stick to human behaviors that work — which the indexers and the quant funds with their large organizations and programmed behavior cannot replicate. We can buy and hold, which is sometimes called time arbitrage.


I will certainly continue to invest in scuttlebutt, LLM channel checks, expert calls and the like. But I know that it will probably be futile. Because everyone can do it. I expect my attention to turn to building the best set of relationships, and to invest in businesses that themselves invest in better sets of relationships.
For this I can think of no better example than Berkshire Hathaway - with its vast number of shareholders. That's a large group who have the lived experience that buying and holding for the long term, rather than chopping and changing, is the way to invest. That will give Buffett's successor, Greg Abel, a far better environment to allocate capital - just as my investor base should afford me the same. I know it's slim pickings, but it should be enough for those of us who remain.


If the only thing AI and LLM's do for finance is to level the playing field - to further marginalize the masters of the universe (and wannabees like me) - would that be such a bad thing? Most likely not.


Thanks to AI, the playing field is more level than it's ever been. Now more than ever there is no need for the average investor to have to pay outrageous fees. A big benefit of the stock market was democratize finance. Perhaps, now, thanks to AI, that day is finally here.",79,76,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkmlfe/the_golden_age_of_value_investing_is_over_guy/,new,Discussion,0.9
1nkmjao,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 18:33:13,Analysis of IREN - second update,"Hi everyone,



Some of you might remember [my previous discussion about IREN when it was trading at $18 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1mnyhsk/analysis_of_iren_an_undervalue_company_for_now/)a month ago. With recent price movements, I wanted to share an updated analysis and get your perspectives.

Current snapshot (Sept 18, 2025):

* Trading at $36.60
* Market cap: $9.968B

**My 2026 Projections:**

Looking at their monthly reports from January through August 2025, I'm conservatively estimating they'll generate $60M in hardware profit monthly starting January 2026.

Annual gross hardware profit: 12 × $60M = $720M

They're targeting $200-250M in GPU service revenue annually. While no contracts are announced yet, partnerships seem likely based on recent industry trends. Assuming 10% for electricity and operating costs:

Annual gross GPU service profit: $180-225M

Total gross annual profit: $900-945M

**Scenario Analysis:**

**Scenario 1: BTC around $115,000**

Converting gross profit to net income (after all costs, taxes, depreciation, etc.):

1. Conservative (20% conversion):
   * Annual net income = $900-945M × 0.2 = $180-189M
   * P/E = $9,968M ÷ $180-189M = 53-55
2. Historical basis (30%, based on FY25 Net/EBITDA ratio of 31.2%):
   * Annual net income = $900-945M × 0.3 = $270-283M
   * P/E = $9,968M ÷ $270-283M = 35-40
3. Base case (40% conversion):
   * Annual net income = $900-945M × 0.4 = $360-378M
   * P/E = $9,968M ÷ $360-378M = 26-28
4. Aggressive (60% conversion):
   * Annual net income = $900-945M × 0.6 = $540-567M
   * P/E = $9,968M ÷ $540-567M = 18-19

**Scenario 2: BTC around $150,000 (30% increase)**

Total gross profit increases to \~$1,160M

1. Conservative (20%): Net income = $1,160M × 0.2 = $232M, P/E = 43
2. Historical (30%): Net income = $1,160M × 0.3 = $348M, P/E = 29
3. Base case (40%): Net income = $1,160M × 0.4 = $464M, P/E = 22
4. Aggressive (60%): Net income = $1,160M × 0.6 = $696M, P/E = 14

**My Take:**

Given the current macro environment with declining interest rates, I conservatively assume Scenario 1, case 3 as the worst case. This gives us a P/E of 26-28 at today's price. For a tech company with solid assets and strong positioning in growing sectors, this seems like reasonable value.

On paper thats a return of a little over 7% on a deal that should close fairly quickly, maybe 6 months-ish?. Of course like most things, its not that simple. There is a slim possibility of a higher bid, and a small possibility the deal is rejected by shareholders mad that they couldn't get a higher bid.

The one reason not to recommend it is the balance sheet is weak, and its lost money most recent years, so if the deal does fall through the downside is very real. But I discount that risk because of the other bidder.

Following is some excerpts from the always excellent Matt Levine's column that gives the lay of the land on this deal.

So they went out and talked to a few potential buyers, including Hearst Newspapers and “a high net worth individual, Party A, whom Mr. Decherd believed had journalistic values similar to those of the Company.” Eventually they reached a deal with Hearst, and in July they [announced the merger](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/cQSD-rUFsF4HKoB4VsY-kfDv-pMDsnOqnSQFeBwIXqDZSSfuCuxk8VXriprlr4IYFBpuUuHR1iOfwnn53VDqwiruqg2bTjNr2CIsbXfjt_reKgueMVDxh0nAxupak8nj4FibCRAWgcm9X0fM3A8U3Mya01uk7KnAwfEqXc9nyGdEPSCqsRYpyC1hZW9tZFmsM2M4XXzOKb0xPLr-PiytyK-SFydoNL32ocfHngyNNEWxIWykDnJOGZwKRrMJut142pWKLuMoVUT8rq7K90LIdwENmNWl0RtR5mwIKpXXFbW08sGKo74Dohjg9xBqJVTg5owTPb7PPleOk9xIBDkfJNNkqy2FhZLNqwk0lbKf02FyIg57jMqlVlDMi_8/13yyOL3KmAcuw_XceqAQuPYsqc_vAa1Y/12).

But the basic situation hasn’t changed. The Alden deal would clearly be better for shareholder value — $20 is more than $16.50 — but Decherd thinks it would be worse for journalism, and he gets to say no. “Having retired from the Board in September 2023 and having had no formal role related to the Company since then, I have no fiduciary responsibility,” [he told the board](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/f46EHZDyrSMPIT_uO260nZr-k_w0MsCReINf5ePd3DX7ZIvSCHXfEe9GM26C8ZN-EVbK6kFjcIifxW7SKs957ZBkFSiR1AraDzCmYivZF4moT8kMnNDMLXw4Uy03YFpXsTd4W7EUUBGcXfjsPdv6aVEP-kk4_UQih6XVxNxvLshYcfNsOlhqy-X4aDqWDyCDq37mntS5HZffcIGOS1mpLe3fpjtiTj7z71nZxfq4AXp0mOpgUZcP4bGhj2oELkyppIGdfe_s6UtB5tb1AwgvpJ8tnasWjjC0QaG8II_clYJ9cr8QzelkAZQrxBk_YgHeR5KLLFb_VMZiR8cQjJ2SXVLiIhDvNi7eVnhJyuoYrsWr0UEn7fiTKp30a8Y/347KtJCaauCp6KmXWEpN3bRkwCb6JI10/12): He doesn’t have to maximize shareholder value.[\[4\]](x-webdoc://4A216BF9-A9A1-4D4F-8C93-27674C55069B#footnote-4) He’s a yes on Hearst and a no on Alden, so there’s no Alden deal.

That doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a Hearst deal. The awkward fact is that, to get any merger done, the company needs the approval of two-thirds of the regular, low-voting shares; Decherd only owns 1.6% of those. Presumably most of the public shareholders care more about the extra $3.50 than they do about Decherd’s journalistic preferences. They don’t get to vote on the $20 Alden deal; they only get to vote on the $16.50 Hearst one. They *could* vote against it, but DallasNews [has said that](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/6CEdb6B4Ppu-EYv7BrC2nECV7L2MR97Vflhc7DPhzGtTPmOA7_fvVMeNYavmMHwE2aUKFDQ4zjrwWa8D_3J5n-MjJFcpy3Yz783W4y3m6MoOaDJI45Ny0WRuPkH5efYppsOC4OnlTt7oAZqVMg92X62zgSADAzSRdifFeH6FLOqmLSX8E3SZOTQ61345AOuTyxEfOtmSGVRc5v-N-LJ13UN8aGolKmej5D4n5vS1P91-RF5aaDiVIAdhFPd-CzxmiNt0xkaFpaDiHLo2q9Lb_3vjeNxYxcBLy6PRLobBgsWTHVle6ZYze1L__U6HNGmSYF2BSjuIS9agTcWQ-7arrbrLHx5Ce1DvNaKZ3PP2RZb1B4HgCn6MkHWtiUY/Zu9lBg5T8x2TE_d24KFYB2E5YqXmaNe0/12), if the Hearst deal is voted down, then there’s no deal: “If the Hearst Merger is not approved by shareholders, we will continue to operate DallasNews as an independent organization.”",2,4,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkmaru/merger_arb_opportunity_daln/,new,Stock Analysis,1.0

Cut the crap, it's been 5 years and the bags have been carried. You here to act smug or make money?

This is not some fairy tale of a $69,420 stock price with pretty images and rocket emojis, no, this is your good old serious DD of why $GME is the safest, most asymmetric bet on the market right now. No short squeezes, no crime, no bells or whistles required — just a very low-risk multi-bagger based on facts and numbers.

## Core Thesis

You've already heard this section 5 years ago from a cat much smarter than me...

It's the Ryan Cohen’s two-phase turnaround plan, which he already executed once with Chewy.

**Phase 1. Stabilize the Business**

The first phase is to avoid bleeding or even bankrupcty. This phase is already done.

- Cut costs
- Close stores
- Streamline operations
- Grow cash
- Reach profitability

**These goals were already achieved at the cost of revenue decline and stock dilution**, both of which are seen as big red flags by institutions.
But these were predictable temporary downtrends, a clear part of the strategy.

**Phase 2. Growth & Digitalization**

Once the company has capital to expand with and no risk of bankruptcy, phase 2 begins.
This is what the institutions are overlooking, still valuing GME based on its history rather than the future — hence the asymmetric opportunity.

- Build new, profitable revenue streams
- Focus on high margin digitalized products
- Focus on repeating loyal customers

This phase has just started with Q1 '25 being the first operating profitable quarter, and Q2 '25 being the first operating profitable quarter with revenue growth.

Further revenue growth will be largely driven by the (growing) collectibles market, and we can already see a +63% collectibles growth in Q2 '25.

GameStop also has a partnership with the most reputable grading service in the US, PSA, which provides high trust and a large inventory.
This partnership enables GameStop to handle everything for the customer, allowing them to buy the card at GameStop, grade the card at GameStop, and sell the card at GameStop for a 90% margin.

Compare this to GameStop's biggest competitor, eBay, where the customer themselves have to do everything:

1. first they buy the card from a potentially scammy seller,
2. then ship it manually for grading,
3. only to then list and sell it manually on eBay for yet another potential scammer buyer.

All while eBay takes a larger cut of ~15%. Even a regard like me would realize it's better to go for GameStop.

For the future we also have confirmed Power Packs, a mystery box for collectible cards, being released as a high margin digital product.
It was just released into beta in Q3 so we don't even see the revenue yet, but knowing people a mystery box is going to be extremely profitable (and more importantly, high in revenue).

Also, there's probably more to come in the upcoming years or even months, but we'll ignore that for this thesis.
Let's only focus on the facts.


## Stock Floor

GME trades at ~$10B market cap, which is very near its cash value of ~$8B.

This heavily limits any potential downside on the investment:

- In the event of GME stock collapsing, the company could buyback its shares for extremely cheap (theoretically buy all of its stock and have money left over).
- In the event of a total market collapse, the company could acquire other companies for cheap.

With ~$450M annual interest income from the ~$8B cash, the business is profitable.
Additionally, both Q1 '25 and Q2 '25 saw positive operating income.

All of this sets a hard floor for the stock at around ~$20, if not higher.

The only real way below this point is for Ryan Cohen to actually _waste_ the billions in cash.  
After having already turned the company around from bleeding to profitable.  
And after erasing all the debt and generating the billions in the first place.  
And after having successfully executed this once with Chewy already.  
All while being invested in the company with his own skin; takes no salary, no stock compensation, just ~$1B worth of stock bought with his own money.  
But sure, he'll burn $10+ billion into nothing.


## The market mispricing

Subtracting the $8B cash from the market cap, we're left with the profitable operating business, loyal customer base, PSA partnership, and a well known brand all being valued at mere $2 billion.
All while leaving **zero** valuation allocated for the future growth potential, which is already visible and happening.

Some of this is explained with GME's P/E of ~50, give or take, which is very much in line with other companies like BestBuy or Chewy.
But these other companies don't have $9B in cash.

So if we only look at the *operating business* itself and calculate the adjusted operating P/E with:

    (Market Cap - Cash) / TTM Operating EPS

We get an adjusted P/E of 4. Yes, **four**.
Even if we subtract the zero interest convertible notes from the cash first, the adjusted P/E still lands at mere 11.
Compare this to peers with 20+ or even 40+ operating P/E, we're looking at 2x to 10x undervaluation.

This mispricing is most likely due to the history and ""meme stock"" status of GME. The big investors and analysts value their career stability and herd growth over stigmatized asymmetric bets:

- Nobody wants to invest into a *meme stock* and be wrong, they would look like a fool and lose a ton of clients or even their job.
- Meanwhile if they lose money in the big stocks like Tesla or NVIDIA, they can blame ""the market"" as they were all wrong together.

If you've seen The Big Short then you know that this kind of herd behavior is not at all abnormal for Wall Street.
Michael Burry's boss and clients yelled at him while the outsiders laughed at him, but we all know how the herd behavior ended for them.

Wait, did I forget to mention that institutions have already increased their position by 100% in just the last year alone?
That they now own ~45% of GME?
Yeah, maybe they're not *all* idiots.


## Stock Potential

The collectibles market in the US alone is ~$62B, estimated to rise to ~$83B by 2030.
Capturing mere 5% of this market would yield ~$4B in annual revenue.
This would be on top of their existing revenue of ~$5B.

Considering how collectibles have great margins, even a 10% operating margin is still a very reasonable estimation.
With these numbers we'd be looking at an annual **profit** of ~1B. That's an EPS of ~$3.00. That's a stock price of $50 - $100.
Again, with an adjusted operating P/E of 4 to 11.

And that is with mere 5% of just the US collectibles market.
With GameStop's brand, a loyal customer base, and PSA partnership, it's very much lowballing the numbers.
Add a bigger share like 10% or even 15%, add a small share of Canada/Europe/Australia as well, add another revenue source besides collectibles, upgrade the operating P/E to 20+...

We're genuinely looking at a target price of anywhere from $100 to $1000+, depending on how well they execute.

And if you *really* wanted to dream **big**, try giving GameStop an NVIDIA-like market dominance status with a 90+% market share of the collectibles market. Yeah, I'll choose not type that number out to avoid people dismissing this thesis as unrealistic.


## Opportunity cost

Let's finish with a very simple comparison with the S&P 500 over the next 3 years.

- **Upside potential:**
  - GME: 2x almost guaranteed, 5x very realistic, 40x theoretically possible.
  - S&P 500: ~33% average over 3 years, maybe ~50% theoretical high.
- **Downside potential:**
  - GME: -20% if operating business gets valued at zero and GME burns some cash on nothing. Chance of Ryan Cohen burning through all the cash is close to zero.
  - S&P 500: AI bubble bursting could crash the market. War or Trump could crash the market. 50% to 70% drop not out of the question. Chance is very real, even if low.

No investment is guaranteed, but GME is as close as we can get right now. It is once again, deep *fucking* value.",11,62,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkjcul/like_it_or_not_the_best_value_stock_out_there/,new,Stock Analysis,0.55

The first thing to catch my eye about DUOL was the quarterly revenue and gross profit curves. Can we all agree that they are a thing of beauty? 

This company now delivers operating margins of 13.5% and an ROE of 19.15%. Again, extremely impressive for a company that's only been profitable for 6 quarters. Their minimal debt shows disciplined execution.

But I don't think we're finished. I think DUOL has the AI-ready platform to scale to a ROE of 60%+ ...we could be talking about the next magnificent company here, a true compounder.

#The Courses

The next thing was to test the app. I had used it about 2 years previously, but now the improvements are enormous. 

They've obviously really thought about the course material, redoing it where necessary. I feel like they have some top PHDs designing the syllabus.

For example, it used to start with sentences like ""the dog drinks water""...

Now it starts with ""I want a coffee"" - literally the first thing you need to say in a new country. Sentence bridges like ""also"" and ""actually"" are introduced early as well, giving flow to sentences, building confidence.

The repetition is now broken up with AI voice calls, language games and podcasts, all hosted by their viral characters.

Recently they announced they would be expanding many more courses from A2 to B2 language proficiency level - even providing language proficiency certificates for employers.

I spoke to my 12 year old foreign nephew for the first time in English the other day. I asked him where he learned English? expecting him to say it was from school - NOPE, it was Duolingo - apparently it's simply fun...

#Unlimited Scalability

DUOL is right to focus on languages right now, but the courses they could add are endless. Here's just a few ideas:

- Sign language
- Personal finance (badly needed imho)
- Home/car maintenance
- Philosophy
- Business administration 
- Geography
- History 

They have already added Chess, Mathematics and Music - Where does it end?!

#AI Hyperscaler

Even without AI, this company is a gem, but with artificial intelligence it's a true beast. They can use AI for:

- Reducing human workload in writing repetitive course material (still human reviewed).
- Creating exciting upsells such as the ""Talk with Lily"" voice call feature.
- Initial drafting of illustrations (this feeds into their viral marketing).
- Directing customer service requests to the right human (my help ticket was responded to in under 2 hours!).

The idea of ChatGPT integrations competing with them is laughable. This isn't as easy to replicate at scale as it looks. They already have the user base momentum...

Actually, the fact most of us still use ChatGPT and Midjourney instead of Gemini, should tell us something about the significance of first-mover advantages in AI.

#Valuation

Now let’s address the high valuation. 

I'm not one of those morons that is going to tell you PE ratios don't matter - earnings absolutely do, and always will matter.

Normally as a value investor I wouldn't buy a company with such a high forward PE.

However, what I look at more is the TRAJECTORY of capital efficiency and operating margins - which in this case (given the clear AI runway) more than justifies the price.

This company is somewhat newly profitable. Some distortion of valuations are to be expected. Earnings in November are likely to continue showing improvement in capital efficiency.

This company is about to start really standing out in stock screeners...",51,78,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkii8i/i_just_bought_100_shares_in_duol/,new,Stock Analysis,0.71

Warren and Charlie taught me that actually there is an opportunity to beat the market through only betting on what you know, avoiding animal spirits and focusing on the long term. That this was partly possible because short term incentives drive most of the investment industry, and those people are most of the market.

1nkf9x3,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 13:52:27,Fannie Mae ($FNMA): Undervalued Housing Finance Giant Trading Below Book with Conservatorship Overhang (9/18/25),"Fannie Mae ($FNMA) currently trades around $13.84 (9/18/25) with book value estimates closer to $10–20 per share.

Despite generating billions annually through its mortgage securitization and guarantee business, common equity remains heavily discounted because of the ongoing government conservatorship and uncertainty over recapitalization.

With Deutsche Bank initiating coverage at Buy ($20 PT) and FHFA reportedly rehiring staff ahead of IPO preparation, the investment case is shifting.

Here’s the breakdown:
Valuation
- Book value range: $10–20+ depending on recapitalization assumptions.
- Current trading price: $13.84, which still embeds a large conservatorship discount.
- Fannie continues to retain earnings (since PSPA changes in 2019), building capital for eventual exit.

Catalysts
- Analyst coverage: Deutsche Bank’s Buy initiation ($20 PT) and B. Riley’s Neutral initiation ($10 PT) bring Wall Street attention.
- IPO chatter: Reports that FHFA is preparing for a partial IPO of Fannie/Freddie stock.
- Conservatorship exit: Any move toward release, recap, or restructuring could re-rate shares closer to book.

Risks
- Dilution: Treasury’s senior preferred conversion or a large equity raise could significantly dilute common shareholders.
- Policy dependence: Exit timing is political/regulatory, not market-driven.
- Interest rate cycle: Higher rates reduce originations and earnings power.

Conclusion
FNMA is not a traditional value play in the Graham & Dodd sense… it’s a policy-driven special situation. But with a wide gap between book value and trading price, and catalysts finally re-emerging (coverage, IPO prep), the asymmetric risk/reward profile makes it worth consideration for patient investors.",7,11,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkf9x3/fannie_mae_fnma_undervalued_housing_finance_giant/,new,Stock Analysis,0.9
1nkepvr,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 13:31:46,Starbucks (SBUX) - Is the company in a death spiral or is this a huge turnaround opportunity?,"**TLDR:**

Starbucks is facing its most profound crisis since 2008. The numbers are grim: global sales are falling, customer traffic is plummeting, and profit margins are collapsing.

In China, what was once their biggest growth engine has become a strategic disaster. They've been completely outmanoeuvred by a local, tech-savvy competitor (Luckin Coffee) and their market share has collapsed. They're now reportedly looking to sell a stake in the China business at a steep discount.

Back in the US, the company is locked in a bitter and expensive war with its own workforce, as hundreds of stores have unionised and the company faces charges of illegal union-busting.

The market is pinning all its hopes on the new CEO, Brian Niccol, the guy credited with turning around Chipotle. He has a comprehensive ""Back to Starbucks"" plan to fix the in-store experience, improve efficiency, and innovate the menu.

The problem? The stock is still trading at an insane valuation (P/E over 36), pricing in a perfect, flawless execution of this turnaround. This seems insane given the massive headwinds. Is the faith in one man justified, or is the market ignoring a business whose fundamentals are cracking?

I wrote a full, in-depth analysis breaking down the numbers, the China debacle, the union fight, and whether Niccol's plan has a realistic chance of success against such a risky backdrop.

Overview
Gambling.com Group ($GAMB, ~$300M market cap) runs an asset-light, high-margin model in the online gambling industry. It earns through:
	•	Affiliate business – referring users to betting sites, earning from new depositing customers (NDCs) and their ongoing activity.
	•	Data business – selling real-time betting data and analytics, now ~25% of revenue and growing rapidly, with strong subscription-like predictability.

Financials
Since its 2021 IPO, revenue grew from $42M to $127M in 2024 (CAGR ~45%). Gross margins remain ~90%+, with adjusted EBITDA rising to $48M and net income to $30M in 2024. Management guides 2025 revenue of $171–175M (+35% YoY) and $62–64M EBITDA (+28%). Historically, GAMB has beaten guidance.

Recent Sell-Off
Despite strong results, shares are down ~49% since Feb 2025 due to:
	1.	Google’s June algorithm update briefly hurting search rankings (since resolved).
	2.	Reported IFRS EPS loss tied to contingent earnout accounting for the Odds Holdings acquisition. This is non-cash and reflects the acquisition outperforming expectations.

Bullish Case
	•	Growing, sticky data revenue (quadrupled YoY, expected to reach 50/50 mix with affiliate).
	•	Expansion tailwinds from new U.S. state gambling legalization.
	•	Strong insider ownership (~40%) and doubled buyback program ($20M).
	•	Management confidence in continued growth through 2025 and beyond.",13,22,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkcvoq/gamb_what_am_i_missing_undervalued_gaming/,new,Stock Analysis,0.89

1nkcawm,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 12:02:17,Got into short term thinking and options.. need to reset.. get back to basics,"So I've been actively investing for 5 years now.. I really got my start during covid as I saw everything was down big and it was an opportunity.. for the first few years I was investing for the long term in most of the stocks I bought. I thought I would hold for at least a year+ .. perhaps forever if I had a lot of conviction.

Then around a year ago, I sold off some stocks for various reasons and had a big pile of cash - at that point, I decided to do a few short term swing trades.. on a few stocks/etfs I saw were see sawing back and forth in price somewhat reliably.. so I bought at the low point of the pattern and sold at the high point.. I did that a couple times and made a ton of money in a matter of weeks.. 

But I was being irresponsible with my position sizing.. I was putting 50%+ of my net worth into a single stock, thinking short term and would sell when I was up 5% - rinse and repeat.....   

However, you may see where this is going.. I saw a big blue chip stock was down 5% for the day.. so I dumped 60% of my entire net worth into it.. but then it continued to slump down.. and go sideways for a couple months.. and I grew antsy.. so I sold it all and took a 6 figure loss. A month or so after I sold it, it rocketed back up and far past where I had initially bought it. The thing is, I actually total belief that would eventually happen, but I got used to making money quickly - and got FOMO and bored waiting too long.

Then I dumped it all into another company that I felt had a solid brand and was trading at 5 year lows.. (for sure it will go back up soon!) .. and again.. it slumped down further over months..  quite a few months went by watching it go lower and lower - and I realized I was paying a big opportunity cost.. so I sold last week and booked a very large loss.

Also in this period of time I dipped my feet into options, mostly selling cash secured puts and covered calls.. options is something I completely avoided for the first few years of my investing journey as I didnt fully understand them and considered them risky.

Long story short - I realize this past year that I got sucked into the habit of short term thinking and essentially gambling and I paid a heavy price for it - as I made some money, but ended up losing more in the end. I also paid a massive opportunity cost - for if I'd just had a diversified portfolio, I would be up a lot this past year with a lot less stress. There were also good long term investments that I correctly recognized, but didnt take advantage of because I was chasing short term gains.

I'm considering removing options trading from my account and rebuilding a diverse portfolio.. with no position greater then 5-10% of my portfolio. Its like I need to retrain my brain to think long term.. and to stop being lured by the prospect of short term profits. 

Maybe I needed to actually learn this lesson the hard way though... maybe in the long run it will be a good thing.. that I actually tested these theories out and got burned.    

Has anyone been through a similar experience of getting lured into short term thinking and successfully recalibrated back to a long term/value investing viewpoint?

1nkbaoy,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 11:24:50,Wendy’s (WEN): An Overlooked Value Play,"TL;DR

Wendy’s trades at a steep discount to peers (EV/EBITDA ~9x vs McDonald’s/YUM ~18–19x). It pays a 5 to 6 percent dividend and has catalysts in AI and supply chain tech (Palantir partnership), a leadership transition and activist oversight. With a 95 percent franchised model that produces steady cash flows and low capital spending WEN offers asymmetric upside for value investors.

⸻

Why WEN Screens as Value

Multiple compression vs peers
WEN trades at about 8.5 to 11x EV/EBITDA while larger burger peers are near 18 to 19x and growth names like Shake Shack above 25x. Even a move back to 12 to 14x could mean significant equity upside.

Cash-light model with real yield
95 percent franchised with stable royalties and low capital needs. Dividend yield sits around 5 to 6 percent so investors get paid to wait.

Clear long-term growth plan at depressed expectations
Management’s algorithm calls for 3 to 4 percent net unit growth, 5 to 6 percent systemwide sales growth and 650 to 700 million dollars EBITDA by 2028. Hitting those targets would force a market rethink.

⸻

Tech and Operational Catalysts

Palantir partnership
Wendy’s supply chain co-op (QSCC) is rolling out Palantir Foundry to optimize purchasing, inventory and waste reduction. This directly improves margins.

AI drive-thru rollout
FreshAI voice ordering is planned to scale to 500 to 600 locations by the end of 2025. Faster throughput, better order accuracy and lower labor costs if successful.

Competitor pause creates open lane
One of the biggest burger chains paused its AI pilot which gives Wendy’s first-mover advantage if execution is solid.

⸻

Leadership and Activist Oversight

CEO transition
Kirk Tanner left in mid-2025. CFO Ken Cook is interim CEO while the board searches. A credible hire plus a refreshed plan can unlock a re-rating.

Trian Partners still at the table
Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund remains a major shareholder and has added shares. Trian has pushed for refranchising, real estate optimization and even take-private moves in the past.

⸻

Why Longevity Matters

Wendy’s was founded in 1969. In quick service, brand equity and menu consistency translate to pricing power and resilience. The Frosty, Baconator and spicy chicken franchise is sticky. That intangible is hard to replicate and underpriced when sentiment is low.

Potential Buyout or Strategic Moves

With a cash-generating, asset-light model and activist oversight a private equity takeout or refranchising and real estate deal is not far-fetched at today’s multiples. It is not a base case but does provide a backstop for downside.

⸻

Key Risks

U.S. traffic softness or promotional pressure on franchisee margins

CEO search taking too long or new leadership missteps

Execution risk on Palantir and AI initiatives

⸻

Bottom Line

At about 9x EV/EBITDA, a 5 to 6 percent dividend yield and credible tech plus leadership catalysts WEN offers a compelling heads I win tails I get paid setup for value investors. In a sector where everyone watches McDonald’s Wendy’s looks like a mispriced middleweight with upside potential.

Some estimates on the low end are $450-900m (assuming the license everything as low end rates of what people pay for the data). Some estimates are over $4 billion (assuming high data valuations). The program for GoPro seems to be an opt-in, with 50% revenue split between GoPro and the owner of the data. 

GoPros market cap, even amid the run up is less than $400M. Assuming some sort of middle ground (fraction of the data is sold at a cost between high and low of the range) - this stock easily doubles or triples.

Joint announcement sends Intel shares soaring in premarket trading

Updated Sept. 18, 2025 at 7:57 am ET

Shares in Intel soared nearly 30% in premarket trading Thursday after Nvidia announced it would invest $5 billion in the challenged chipmaker, giving the government’s turnaround plan a potential boost.

Nvidia said it’s buying $5 billion in Intel’s common stock at $23.28 a share and would jointly develop data center and personal computing products.


The investment pairs the world’s most valuable company, which has been a darling of the AI boom, with a chip maker that has fallen behind rivals. It further shores up Intel a month after the U.S. government said it was taking a 10% stake in an extraordinary private-sector intervention.

I’ve used this as a base for some of my picks… and it just hasn’t worked. I feel like this is what I should be looking at, yet every time I’ve used it it’s failed me

Whereas when I first started, I went on the practice account in trading 212 and made a pie which is now up by 35%l… and I didn’t check a single company other than just looking at them and going “I like what they do”

 I’ve got a couple picks I wanna look into before actually putting money into them, so what do you look for and where do you look when screening a pick before investing?

I realise there’s more to it than just data and numbers, I’ve seen a lot of people say that they go way more off general “vibes”, looking at the market and the growth potential of the company rather than numbers, so I’m just interested to see what people look at before putting money into

Also, is my list just complete crap anyway?

1nk44m2,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 06:00:04,PYPL just announced AI partnership with Google - thoughts?,"**TLDR:** Google-PayPal multi-year deal makes PYPL a key processor for Google Cloud/Play. Stock up 3% after hours. Could advertising data sharing be the real opportunity here?

Google and PayPal dropped news about a multi-year deal where PayPal becomes a key payment processor for Google Cloud, Google Play, etc. Stock only gained 3% after hours which seems modest for what sounds like a significant partnership.

PayPal gets integrated across Google's ecosystem and Google's AI gets incorporated into PayPal's security services. This seems more substantial than their usual announcements since it involves Google Cloud enterprise payments, not just consumer-facing features.

What's interesting for me is that PayPal has been pushing into advertising lately, and Google obviously dominates that space. Could this partnership open doors for shared advertising data? Both companies could benefit from combining Google's search/ad targeting with PayPal's transaction data. That would be a pretty powerful combination for advertisers.

Been considering picking up some PayPal shares. Does this partnership signal the bottom of the stock and maybe the catalyst PYPL needs to break out of its current trading range, or is that 3% aftermarket bump all we're likely to see?

1nk42gb,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 05:56:10,Microstrategy is one of the worst investments to own,"I’ve been following MicroStrategy for a while now, and after the latest moves I felt I had to dig deeper. The more I looked, the more it reinforced my view that this company is basically the most dangerous way to own Bitcoin. A few things stood out:

The premium is collapsing. MSTR used to trade at 2–3x the value of the Bitcoin it held. That gap has shrunk dramatically, and without that premium the whole “intelligent leverage” model stops working.

Dilution has gone into overdrive. They’ve raised tens of billions this year alone through share sales and preferred stock. The share count has nearly doubled in months.
The preferreds are Ponzi-like. Proceeds from new offerings are explicitly allowed to be used to pay dividends on the old ones. That’s not sustainable.

Michael Saylor’s “never sell Bitcoin” mantra ignores risk. It’s fine as a meme, but as a corporate policy it’s insane. If Bitcoin takes a typical 70–80% drawdown, the debt and dividend obligations wipe out the equity.
Even skeptics like Jim Chanos flagged this. He called it a “perpetual motion machine of dilution,” and watching the last few months play out, it really does look that way.

Here's the post if you want the full breakdown with a 15 minute podcast (charts, filings, stress-tests, etc.): https://open.substack.com/pub/tscsw/p/avoid-microstrategy-inc-the-bitcoin?r=203zi2&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true

It honestly feels less like a Bitcoin play and more like a house of cards that only stood up as long as people were willing to pay a crazy premium. Now that premium is eroding, is this the beginning of the end for MSTR?

Curious what others here think - am I being too harsh, or is this as structurally broken as it looks?

1nk33tp,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 04:53:24,$APLD DD AI Datacenters huge run from $3 --> $20 since April,"I think $APLD deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story.

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.

Not financial advice. Just my DD.

1nblsgb,2025-09-08,2025-09-08 08:00:40,"The S&P500 is still underwater YTD, adjusted for currency depreciation","I am not trying to make any predictions here, but after the ""great crash"" of 2025 a few months ago, many people jumped the gun in saying: ""you see? it's all panic, stocks only go up"". I am heavily invested in Europe since last year and I have been warning that Trump would not be good for the US stock market. People did not believe me back then and do not believe me now. YTD, the S&P500 is up 9.7%. At the same time, the USD vs EUR is down -11%. If we add in inflation, it's even worse.

Right now, this bull market is sustained only by AI hype and not much else, with the mega caps outperforming the rest of the index, while recent job reports now suggest that the economy is going worse, hitting highest youth unemployment since May 2021. Perhaps the stock market will continue to go up, because higher unemployment means lower rates, but it also means inflation will probably be higher. If Trump gets want he wants with rates, turkey-style hyperinflation is not impossible. Given that the US government debt relative to GDP continues to compound, either the dollar goes down in value, or taxes need to go up, at some point. 

Damaging diplomatic relationships and putting in question the independence of the FED and meddling with the private sector (I am pointing at Trump saying that Intel's CEO should be fired, his decision to stop near-completed wind turbine projects being built in the US by Danish companies, his relationship with musk, saying he wants to lower the value of the dollar to make exports competitive....) is the worst thing he can do, since US bonds and stocks is one of the biggest exports that the US has. This is justified by the ""US exceptionalism"". But if this exceptionalism is put into question, that will have huge consequences. 

Regardless, what the FED does or does not do should not influence us as value investors, but my point remains: US exceptionalism is more than priced in already, and at current multiples, it is justified by AI, recency bias, and a tendency of investors to chase returns.

1nsd54h,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 22:36:03,One of the best performing tech stocks of all time is on sale. And it’s not the Mag 7. Or even in the US.,"Constellation Software ($CSU.TO / $CNSWF) is experiencing a rare drawdown, in fact, the largest drawdown since IPO back in 2006. The founder, Mark Leonard, has been known as Canadas Warren Buffet, and is touted as one of the greatest capital allocators of all time. His shareholder letters are of renowned status, and anyone who has done any amount of research into the company knows the management quality is unparalleled. 

Constellation Software's compounding returns have quietly outshone almost every other stock since its IPO, cementing its place as one of the all-time great performers, all without being a member of the ""Magnificent Seven."" The company's unique, decentralized, long-term acquisition strategy for mission-critical vertical market software has created a fortress of recurring revenue. The services provided are known by shareholders to be sticky and switching costs are high. The company maintains relationships with potential acquisitions and holds a record of over 50,000 companies to potentially acquire. Since IPO, only one company has ever been re-sold, and Mark Leonard says this was one of his biggest regrets. 

I believe recent drawdown is entirely overblown. Skepticism over the impact of AI on its vast portfolio neglects Constellation's deep, embedded and entrenched specialized knowledge and systems in niche customer workflows—an enduring advantage against generalized AI tools. Furthermore, the stock's plunge following founder Mark Leonard's resignation for health reasons, though understandable given his legendary status, discounts the company's established, deep management bench and decentralized acquisition structure, which was built for perpetual operation beyond any single individual. The long-term thesis remains firmly intact. Mark Miller, the new CEO, himself has over 30 years with the company, leaving little doubt to his performance capabilities. 

The company typically commands a high premium, usually at 35-40x forward FCF. However, with last weeks intense sell off, the 2026E FCF multiple is currently in the low to mid 20s. I think this presents a very compelling opportunity for a company that has historically compounded at 20-30%. 

I believe this is a very rare buying opportunity. Next week, Constellation is holding a meeting to discuss the recent resignation of Mark Leonard. Volatility will likely remain high. I currently own 52 shares and will consider adding more in this dip.


**EDIT:**

Added below is one of the comments I made regarding what I believe is the root issue with the AI bear thesis - 

This is where the core issue of the AI arguement is: VMS will only lose value if they lose their customers.

I'm highly doubtful that artificial intelligence, any time in the near future, will upend and displace niche mission critical vertical market softwares. Typically, the cost of these vertical market softwares as a proportion of revenue generated from the business is one percent or less. There's no way that a municipality, utility, government agency or a healthcare facility (all common customers of CSU) will suddenly want to exchange deeply embedded VMS software for a new random vibe coded artificial intelligence mess, which will be riddled with bugs, issues, errors and inefficienceis. CSU's softwares have over the years been custom tailored and designed for each specific industry and business. Further, while AI has been shown to be decent at generating new code for simple programs, it's quite bad at debugging and fixing issues and errors. Like one commentor put it, good for greenfield, bad for brownfield. 

Imagine having to retrain hundreds of employees on how to use a new software that's been used by the business for the last fifteen to twenty years. Then fix all the new bugs, issues and inefficiencies on top of that. And remember when I said, the expense for this software is <1% of their revenue? Are they going to go through this headache? No.

Real world example - I work as a physical therapist with a home health agency. We still use a software on our company mobile devices called ""HomeCare HomeBase"" that was made for Blackberries with a keyboard and stylus for use by nurses 15 years ago. We still use it today and it's still one of the largest home health softwares used by home health agencies in the US. It's the same concept. For these businesses, switching out the software is just not worth the disruption in business operations for at best a minor operational efficiency improvement and practially no cost savings.

Also, on top of all that, consider the opposite approach with AI for CSU. Wouldn't one stand to reason that with all the proprietary data and relationships CSU has with its customers, they would actually be primed to take advantage of the AI wave and improve their own software thats already in use by their customers? That's the other way to look at AI.",324,189,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nsd54h/one_of_the_best_performing_tech_stocks_of_all/,month,Stock Analysis,0.89

1ngzm6d,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 14:57:36,Comparing 3 Studies on Multibagger Stocks,"Decided to compare research from three studies about stocks that return 10-100x+ your money and share my findings here.

Here's what I read through:

* Christopher Mayer: ""100 Baggers"" (2015); Covered 1962-2014.
* Jenga Investment Partners (Dede Eyesan): ""Global Outperformers"" (2023); Covered 2012-2022.
* Anna Yartseva: ""The Alchemy of Multibagger Stocks"" (2025); Covered 2009-2024.

Clearly, these aren't apples-to-apples comparisons. Besides the time period differences, Mayer looked at 100-baggers using case studies. Jenga performed academic research on 446 global 10-baggers (not just US stocks), and Yartseva used statistical models on 464 NYSE and NASDAQ-traded stocks. These studies may suffer from survivorship bias as well.

Regardless, I think it's an interesting comparison to potentially understand recurring themes/patterns and identify any surprising findings.

# What Doesn't Matter

**Earnings Growth**

One of the most surprising findings was on earnings growth and how many investors/books say it's essential, including Mayer.

However, Yartseva's statistical analysis found that earnings growth was NOT a significant predictor of multibagger returns.

Specifically, she tested EPS growth, EBITDA growth, gross profit growth, operating profit (EBIT) growth, and net profit growth over both 1-year and 5-year periods. None were statistically significant in her dynamic panel regression models.

Interestingly, while Yartseva found earnings growth wasn't predictive, her winners still achieved impressive growth rates: 17.3% CAGR in operating profit, 22.9% in net profit, and 20.0% in EPS.

Eyesan found the average profitable company grew operating earnings at 20% CAGR.

**Industry**

Yartseva's 464 multibaggers came from several sectors, not just tech:

Information Technology (20%), Industrials (19%), Consumer Discretionary (18%), Healthcare (14%), and even traditionally slow-growth sectors like Utilities (1%).

Eyesan found similar sector diversity among his 446 global outperformers: Information Technology led with 25.8%, followed by Industrials (15.2%), Healthcare (14.1%), Materials (13.5%), and Consumer Discretionary (10.5%).

Notably, Information Technology, Healthcare, and Materials outperformed relative to their market representation. Tech represented 25.8% of winners but only 12.7% of the overall market. Semiconductors alone jumped from 1 outperformer in 2002-2012 to 44 in 2012-2022.

This broad distribution suggests screening by sector would eliminate many opportunities.

**Other Factors**

Yartseva's research also found several widely-tracked metrics showed no predictive power:

* Dividend policies (58% of multibaggers paid dividends at start, 78% by end - no correlation).
* Debt levels (debt-to-equity and debt-to-capital ratios didn't predict returns).
* Share buybacks (no statistical significance).
* Analyst coverage (being followed or ignored didn't matter).
* Altman Z-scores for bankruptcy risk (failed statistical tests).
* R&D spending relative to free cash flow (surprisingly no correlation with becoming a multibagger).

# What Actually Matters

**Company Size**

Every single study found that smaller companies outperform:

* Mayer: Median $500M market cap, with median sales of $170M.
* Eyesan: Found 63% of winners were nano-caps (<$50M market cap) in 2012, with only 7/446 winners (1.6%) being large caps.
* Yartseva: $348M median market cap in 2009, with median revenue of $702M. Notably, Yartseva found that small-cap stocks generated average excess returns of 37.7% annually, compared to 14.5% for mid-caps and 9.7% for large-caps.

This makes logical sense given it's easier to grow from a small base - a $100M company doubling is much easier than a $100B company doubling.

**Moats**

All three studies agreed on competitive advantages/moats. Companies need something protecting their profits from competition:

* Mayer: Emphasized economic moats as essential for durability. ""A 100-bagger requires a high return on capital for a long time. A moat, by definition, is what allows a company to get that return.""
* Eyesan: Found that outperformers typically had or developed competitive advantages.
* Yartseva: While acknowledging competitive advantages were important based on prior literature, she didn't isolate this as a specific variable in her models, instead incorporating it into overall business quality metrics.

**Patience**

They also agreed on patience:

* Mayer: 100-baggers took 26 years on average. Also emphasized the ""coffee-can"" portfolio philosophy.
* Eyesan: All 446 global outperformers achieved their 10-bagger status within 10 years (2012-2022 study period).
* Yartseva: 10-baggers ranged from 7.5 to 40.5 years, with her 464 stocks averaging 26-fold returns (21.4% CAGR) over 15 years.

**Revenue Growth**

Revenue growth was discussed across all studies:

* Mayer: Emphasized the need for significant growth but didn't specify a minimum rate.
* Eyesan: Found 15% CAGR average revenue growth in his winners.
* Yartseva: Found 11.1% CAGR median revenue growth in her winners.

**FCF Yield & Book Value**

Yartseva's statistical model confirmed free cash flow (FCF) to price ratio as the most important driver of multibagger stock outperformance.

In her regression models, FCF/P showed coefficients ranging from 46 to 82, while book-to-market (B/M) showed coefficients from 7 to 42. Together, a 1% increase in FCF/P and B/M ratios was associated with 7-52% higher annual returns.

FCF/P captures both the company's cash generation and what you're paying for it.

B/M ratios above 0.40 combined with positive operating profitability showed higher chances of positive returns in Yartseva's portfolio sorts.

However, Yartseva warns to avoid companies with negative equity (where liabilities exceed assets). Small-cap companies w/negative equity declined 18.1% annually, medium-caps fell 9.4%, and large-caps dropped 7.6%.

**Other Valuation Metrics**

Yartseva's winners started with median valuations of P/S 0.6, P/B 1.1, forward P/E 11.3, and PEG 0.8, all suggesting they were undervalued at the start.

Eyesan found that 48.9% of outperformers started trading below 10x EV/EBIT and 50.7% below 1x EV/Revenue, suggesting most winners begin at low valuations rather than high growth premiums.

Yartseva found EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA were significant in some model specifications but lost significance in her more robust models, suggesting they matter but aren't as reliable as FCF/P.

**Profitability Threshold**

Profitability metrics appeared in all three studies but with different focuses:

* Mayer: Preferred 20%+ ROE.
* Eyesan: Focused on return on capital (ROC) and required it to be above industry average.
* Yartseva: Found just 9% median ROE but noted it was growing. Her winners started with modest profitability - gross margins averaged 34.8%, EBIT margins just 3.9%, ROC 6.5%.

Overall, profitability seemed to matter but nothing spectacular to start. Based on these studies, companies should ideally be profitable when you pick them, but you don't need amazing numbers - even 9% ROE may work if it's improving.

**Other Profitability Metrics**

Beyond ROE, several metrics are worth mentioning:

* Return on assets (ROA): Yartseva found coefficients of 0.4 to 1.9, meaning for every 1% increase in ROA, stock returns increased by 0.4% to 1.9% (which is small).
* Return on capital (ROC): Mayer called it critical, Eyesan required above-industry average, and Yartseva found 6.5% median in her winners.
* Operating (EBIT) margins: 82% of Eyesan's winners were profitable at the start, with median EBIT margin of 12%. Among profitable companies, those with >10% margins grew from 48% in 2012 to 85% by 2021; those with >20% margins grew from 17% to 47%.
* EBITDA margins: 30-60% for winners (Eyesan), confirmed significant by Yartseva whose models showed EBITDA margin as a statistically significant predictor with positive coefficients in her initial models.

Notably, according to Eyesan, 74% of winners grew earnings faster than revenue. This means companies were becoming more profitable over time, not just growing sales.

**Multiple Expansion**

Multiple expansion means the market paying more for each dollar of earnings over time (e.g., P/E going from 10x to 20x):

* Mayer: Described ""twin engines"" of earnings growth plus multiple expansion, showing examples of P/E expanding from 3.5x to 26x, which when combined with earnings growth created 100x returns.
* Eyesan: Found 91% of winners had EV/Revenue expansion and 72% had EV/EBITDA expansion.
* Yartseva: While Yartseva didn't isolate multiple expansion as a single variable, her findings strongly suggest valuation changes rather than earnings growth drive multibagger returns.

**Reinvestments**

All studies emphasized reinvestment capability, but with nuance:

* Mayer: Emphasized reinvestment as the most important factor - specifically companies that can reinvest profits at 20%+ returns consistently.
* Eyesan: Discussed how successful M&A strategies and aggressive expansion drove returns for many outperformers.
* Yartseva: Found that if a company's asset growth exceeds its EBITDA growth, returns drop 4-11%. This means companies must invest aggressively BUT only if their earnings are growing fast enough to support that investment.

**Ownership**

Mayer found 7% annual outperformance among owner-operators and quoted Martin Sosnoff's rule that management should own at least 10-20% of the company.

Yartseva noted owner-operators in her sample had significant vested interests (though she didn't test ownership as a specific variable).

Eyesan noted that 67% of outperformers had insider ownership above 5% (vs. 49% in the broader market), but didn't treat this as a defining factor. Instead, he emphasized qualitative signs of management-shareholder alignment like maintaining focus through acquisitions, proper capital allocation, and consistent execution of core strategy.

**Entry Timing**

For timing, buy beaten-down stocks:

* Yartseva: Stock should be near 12-month low at time of purchase.
* Mayer: Highlighted beaten-down, forgotten stocks returning to profitability as prime 100-bagger candidates.
* Eyesan: Found turnarounds deliver strong returns when problems are solvable (like fixing marketing inefficiencies or distribution issues, rather than fundamental product failures).

Yartseva also tested price momentum over various periods and found one-month momentum slightly positive, meaning stocks that rose last month tend to continue rising.

However, 3-6 month momentum was negative - stocks that performed well over the previous quarter or half-year tend to reverse, suggesting multibaggers are volatile and don't follow smooth upward trends.

**Macro Environment**

Interest rates matter. Yartseva quantified that rising Fed rates knock 8-12% off multibagger returns the following year.

This makes sense because multibaggers tend to be smaller companies that likely rely more on external financing and whose future cash flows are worth less when discount rates rise.

**Geographic Shift**

Lastly, Eyesan's data showed that 59% of recent 10-baggers came from Asia:

* India: 91 companies.
* USA: 60 companies.
* Japan: 49 companies.
* China: 34 companies.

This suggests that if you're only looking at US stocks, you're missing a lot of opportunity.

Moreover, this is striking given Asia represents only 10% of global mutual fund portfolios, suggesting massive underallocation to the region.

Eyesan also noted important regional differences in how earnings translate to returns. Markets like India, Japan, and the Nordics show good earnings-to-returns conversion efficiency, while markets like China and Latin America often see earnings growth that doesn't translate well to stock returns.

1nvuluv,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 00:49:36,AMZN is cheaper than you think,"So I'm sure many people are looking at AMZN's P/E ratio of 33.7x and thinking that while it's more reasonable than it used to be, it's still pretty expensive. Especially when you can pickup shares of GOOGL or META at 26x. But I think a useful valuation metric to look at is the price to operating cash flow and I'll explain why.

Net income is an accounting metric that includes depreciation and amortization, and it's up to the business to decide the schedule for those, meaning they can decide, for example, that the useful life of a GPU is 6 years when in reality it's probably 2 years. Another problem is that GAAP requires companies to mark to market any investments each quarter, meaning that if a company holds shares of a different company, the change in price effects net income.

This is why investors run discounted cash flow models, because ultimately cash is what matters--not accounting results. The value of a business is the present value of the future cash you can extract from the business over its life. The problem with using free cash flow is that capex is part of the equation, and capex is highly variable year to year. Some years you may buy a new office building and a new warehouse and a bunch of warehouse equipment, and other years you might not buy anything.

Operating cash flow removes capex from the equation which allows you to simply focus on how much cash the business actually produces from its operations. Not paper gains of a stock they hold, or because they chose to extend the useful life of their assets. Just the operations.

So on a price to trailing twelve month P/OCF ratio, here are the results for the Magnificent 7 stocks:

* TSLA: 91.3x
* NVDA: 59.0x
* AAPL: 34.9x
* MSFT: 28.3x
* GOOGL: 22.1x
* AMZN: 19.4x
* META: 17.6x

Now you might think this is stupid because free cash flows are what matter. Who cares if your operating cash flow is great but you need to spend it all on capex to continue generating the cash flow? While this is true, I think it's useful to compare just the operating businesses as capex is highly variable and is a choice that doesn't need to be made in perpetuity. Now of course, AMZN is by far the most structurally capital intensive (besides TSLA? maybe?) since they actually move real stuff in the real world so that needs to be taken into consideration. 

Anyway, just thought I'd share. I think understanding the price you're paying relative to the cash generated by operations is useful and should be considered when evaluating a business' valuation.

By Jordan Blum

Editor, Energy

October 2, 2025 at 3:30 PM EDT

The big move by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to buy the chemicals business of oil giant Occidental Petroleum for nearly $10 billion is a double win for Berkshire, analysts say, in Buffett’s potential swan song deal before retiring at the end of December.  The Oct. 2 deal is the first-ever Berkshire announcement that quotes incoming CEO Greg Abel and doesn’t mention the current chief executive by name.

The OxyChem business will operate as a strong stand-alone for Berkshire, while the deal should boost Berkshire’s nearly 30% ownership of parent Oxy because the Houston company will use the bulk of the proceeds to pay off the high debt load that’s dragged down its stock in recent years, said Doug Leggate, Wolfe Research energy analyst.

“It’s genius. It’s certainly a win-plus for Berkshire because it also helps the company that they own 30% of,” Leggate said. “It’s completely self-serving, it’s logical, and—not in any nefarious way—definitely helpful.”

The $9.7 billion, all-cash OxyChem deal is Berkshire’s largest since scooping up insurance player Alleghany in 2022. In recent years, Berkshire has focused on selling off stakes of its investments and is sitting on a whopping mound of almost $350 billion in cash.

Leggate called OxyChem a steady potential cash cow that focuses on its growing chlor-alkali business manufacturing PVC (polyvinyl chloride) resin for piping, construction materials, medical equipment, and more. Its business largely moves with the housing market, which could soon benefit more from falling interest rates. “It’s a low-volatile, uncontroversial, niche business that has pricing power given the market structure,” he said.

The 95-year-old Buffett announced his retirement plans in May, although Abel has long been tapped as his eventual successor.  Abel, the longtime Berkshire vice chairman of noninsurance operations, praised the OxyChem deal and Oxy CEO Vicki Hollub in the announcement.

“Berkshire is acquiring a robust portfolio of operating assets, supported by an accomplished team,” Abel said in the announcement. “We look forward to welcoming OxyChem as an operating subsidiary within Berkshire. We commend Vicki and the Occidental team for their commitment to Occidental’s long-term financial stability, as demonstrated by their plan to use proceeds to reinforce the company’s balance sheet.”

Berkshire did not immediately respond to interview requests.

Specifically, Oxy said, it will use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce debt and bring its principal debt below the $15 billion target it set following the late 2023 acquisition of Permian Basin oil producer CrownRock for $12 billion.  Hollub said the deal helps Oxy focus on its core oil and gas business, especially in the booming Permian, while strengthening its financial position through debt reduction.

OxyChem represents almost 20% of Oxy’s total pretax income, bringing in more than $1 billion annually.

**The Berkshire-Oxy courtship**

The intimate Berkshire-Oxy relationship dates back to 2019 when Oxy entered a dramatic bidding war with the much larger Chevron to acquire oil producer Anadarko Petroleum.  Anadarko had chosen to sell to Chevron when Oxy came back with a larger $38 billion offer that included much more cash—too good for Anadarko to turn down.

That offer only came to fruition when Hollub took a whirlwind trek to Omaha to see Warren Buffett and his Berkshire team. After a 90-minute meeting, Buffett committed $10 billion to finance the merger in exchange for preferred shares and a stake in the expanded Oxy.

The agreements allowed Oxy to boost its cash offer to about 80% of the purchase price in its successful David-versus-Goliath bidding war against Chevron.

Since then, Buffett has increased Berkshire’s stake in Oxy to more than 28%.

But in the meantime, the big acquisitions left Oxy with a much greater debt load, especially going into the pandemic in 2020. Oxy barely survived the downturn, slashing its dividend from 79 cents per share each quarter down to just one penny. Since then, the dividend has risen back up to 24 cents—still much lower than in 2019.

The OxyChem deal largely solves the debt problem, although Oxy won’t begin redeeming Berkshire’s preferred shares—and their 8% annual interest—until 2029.

“In a world where crude \[pricing\] is softening, Oxy has too much debt. It’s unequivocal that it’s a good thing for Oxy to raise cash and pay down debt,” said Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Pickering Energy Partners consulting and research firm.

While Abel may already be in the dealmaking driver’s seat for Berkshire, Pickering said, “\[Buffett\] was the driver of the original Oxy investment, so I’m sure he was involved.”

Pickering compared Berkshire’s likely double win for both OxyChem and Oxy to a “circular loop” like the booming AI sector’s recent investments in one another’s companies: “AI is in a circular loop where Nvidia gives money to somebody, who gives money to somebody, who gives it back to Nvidia.”

The only problem for Oxy on Oct. 2, though, was its stock surprisingly fell by 7%. Oxy had outperformed the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF by about 2.5% this week through Oct. 1, largely baking in the deal before the Oct. 2 announcement.

Oxy is selling its chemicals business at a bit of a discount when the broader petrochemical sector is near a cyclical trough.

Pickering said there was some “sell the news dynamic” at play. But the sale also diminishes some hopes that Berkshire would buy Oxy in its entirety, potentially hurting the stock.

“By buying these pieces, the odds that he’s going to buy it all have gone down,” Pickering said.

A year ago, this reporter asked Hollub at what point Berkshire might control too much Oxy stock. Her response: “We would never consider it to be too much.”",208,18,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwinqk/warren_buffetts_berkshire_hathaway_may_have/,month,Buffett,0.96

*The banks knew this, but*

*The market did not.*

*In particular, the banks held lots of shares of Archegos’s seven stocks (ViacomCBS Inc., Baidu Inc., Discovery Inc., etc.), which served as collateral for their loans to Archegos.*[*\[1\]*](x-webdoc://A646B867-E480-4F8E-B2C3-CEB2FAE4F2DE#footnote-1) *They knew that Archegos would not pay back their loans, so each bank knew that it — and every other bank — would have to sell the collateral.

*But if the banks sold before the news came out, they might get away with it: They could sell quietly before the market caught on to the problem, and they could perhaps sell the shares for more than Archegos owed them. And in fact some banks* [*moved quickly and did fine*](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/WluyUDJCu7HugRGvVVzYWZieoPNJDMgyXABdD7KNlOzYPOoT8LQcsVj0QdXEaxZ9j1ojg2cetjjwYy52kEFimLakBPQVwIugTqw-y3zI8cLCqm3AtyLDSAFzaQpoCUYSz83kZG5mUyjzEY1w9CXyG_CDPeQdsT7I-JAIZmvcwGe_c-gWvgN_1Uxmv0AKjh-7R9Ejn7tbIwrSaZnRV0G_I-pt0mklYH_l4ScJjrZs_B868QdZrD9q9QfaKQlQ6VfNiBKuZa-MZMl4beNR_ZpGo7cY8OYa5MMm8CwwpcZSmZWMJ3wwTxVP-y1tv2xwC9mKMTZPMOmjth8rRBXG6q1FYXC2to7uYyiecqlIT3EuSkuUYKTTR0jPl3j-TQ/wLTVGF7n3XOoB_oVHG-HFo9Q3m7zyyS0/12)*, and other banks moved slowly and lost billions of dollars.*[*\[2\]*](x-webdoc://A646B867-E480-4F8E-B2C3-CEB2FAE4F2DE#footnote-2) *(Basically the fast banks’ sales alerted the market that something was going on, and the market caught on before the slow banks could sell.)*

It is generally legal, in the US, to trade on information that no one else has. What is illegal is misusing someone else’s information. A chief executive officer who trades on inside information about her own stock is misappropriating that information from her shareholders*[*\[3\]*](x-webdoc://A646B867-E480-4F8E-B2C3-CEB2FAE4F2DE#footnote-3)*; a therapist who trades on what the CEO tells him in a therapy session is misappropriating that information from his patient. But if Warren Buffett knows that his purchases of a stock will move the stock up, he is allowed to buy the stock without first disclosing his plans to buy it: Trading on your own secret information is fine. (Not legal advice!)*

*What about here? The banks were trading on material nonpublic information about Archegos. Did they have a duty not to trade on it? Some investors sued to find out, “alleging that they traded in the Issuers’ stocks at the same time the \[banks\] were selling their Archegos-related positions,” that they lost money to the banks, and that the banks were doing insider trading.*

*Today they lost in a federal appeals court. Here is* [*the opinion*](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/97hFJfqAr2mhGrj-A5HwQ_eRFAvLk_Wn-K8XLNGmSPp3FAQ-0BSDcDO97KSPvoiRHpvIAn9qR7zNVR3RtEzq4_wEByDmljFFT6nxP-YxccEKfqmEkvNj1RTnFmdi3aG4MC9YC32me2lqgGNJDgtbNNajihh9YIyisnTO1JcO8GQV0EnBch_8JNdrLXGAuWhac7skT5lMyqWRCVStp-zAsnvWAXVIA28iAlS81vj1SmSriw1E40JMVy2Ap-LqkfPpiKNtahQ--gkH7WTrlT_581apOFb50zjZ8dfQgY1c95MaW_ow8alBnSSrvERRcV53se8s44sKlnUCisVfVvjcjSw9VpU4yqR4VhcmaAseQRUG28dKt3tR8IHUk9E/9dV5vdL4KpX6ytnBOaJMk4EXxihcieba/12)*. To be insider trading, the court writes, there has to be evidence that “either (1) Archegos owed a fiduciary or fiduciary-like duty to the Issuers’ shareholders or (2) \[the banks\] owed a fiduciary or fiduciary-like duty to Archegos.” The first is clearly not true: Archegos was an outside shareholder of its companies, and had no special relationship or inside information.*

*The second possibility — that the banks had some duty to Archegos not to trade on their information about its collapse — is more plausible, but the court rejected that too:*

>

*This strikes me as completely correct. The whole point of lending money to a hedge fund collateralized by its stock positions is that, if you send the hedge fund a margin call and it doesn’t post more money, you can blow out of the stock before it collapses. If you had to disclose “hey our customer is collapsing and we gotta sell its stock,” the stock would be worthless as collateral.*

*Still it is quite harsh on the buyers! They bought stock for way more than it was worth, because the banks knew something that they didn’t. Doesn’t seem fair.

The deal, requiring 4.5 gigawatts of power, ranks among the largest in the computing sector to date.","Oracle shares soared more than 40% Wednesday after quarterly results revealed multiple multibillion-dollar AI contracts, cementing its role as a key player in the space. Despite missing Wall Street’s earnings estimates, Oracle reported $455 billion in remaining performance obligations—quadruple last year’s figure—highlighting strong growth prospects.

The company surprised analysts with aggressive guidance: cloud revenue of $18 billion this fiscal year, nearly doubling to $32 billion by 2027, and potentially reaching $144 billion by 2030. These projections align closely with the OpenAI contract, underscoring Oracle’s expectations for exponential expansion in its AI-driven cloud business.

- Goldman Sachs have initiated coverage of Rolls-Royce with a Buy rating, with a target of £12.90 /  $17.40  - recognising the turnaround story since covid, and the huge profit margin and FCF improvements in recent years.

- Citigroup have upgraded their price target to £14.40 / $19.44. (The difference appears to be that Citigroup have recognised how massively exciting the Nuclear Energy side of the business is, whereas Goldman haven’t even mentioned it.)

- JP. Morgan have also just identified Rolls-Royce as top 12-month picks, and them as capable of exceeding consensus earnings forecasts in the second half of 2025, placing them on Positive Catalyst Watch. https://www.reddit.com/r/RYCEY/s/mq1EpPz6Vv

- Nuclear energy stocks are roaring upwards, sending nuclear energy speculative stocks soaring despite being loss-making, and despite no revenues in some cases (OKLO!), so it’s only a matter of time before attention turns to a high-growth, cash-generative business like Rolls Royce, which keeps announcing new deals.

- Rolls-Royce won a £2,500,000,000 deal in June to build nuclear reactors in the United Kingdom.

- Rolls-Royce builds and maintains the Nuclear reactors powering submarines.  They signed a £9,000,000,000 contract with the UK Ministry of Defence to provide long-term support for the existing fleet and future builds, securing its role in the UK's nuclear deterrent for decades to come.

- Saudi Arabia Railways will be using more Rolls-Royce engines in their trains than before. Since 2012, there have been seventy 12V 4000 engines used in trains operated by Saudi Arabia Railways, and – having been impressed by their quality even in the harshest of conditions – Saudi Arabia have ordered an additional 50 trains with RR engines, as announced a month ago. A statement on the quality of their engines generally - beyond only in planes !   https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2025/21-08-2025-rr-to-supply-50-mtu-engines-for-high-speed-trains-in-saudi-arabia.aspx

- Rolls’s Power Systems division has received its largest ever Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) order, after Lithuanian energy supplier Ignitis selected Rolls-Royce to supply large-scale battery energy storage systems, in a huge deal announced last week. https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2025/16-09-2025-rr-biggest-battery-order-for-rolls-royce-large-scale-energy-storage-system-in-lithuania.aspx

Sure I’ve missed so many things there as all the many divisions of Rolls-Royce seems to be on turbo charge at the moment.

With aviation demand rising (and especially from Airbus more than Boeing),  with defence spending rising, and with the growing and desperate need for more sustainable energy solutions from nuclear, etc etc, it is inevitable that Rolls-Royce will be announcing more deals on all fronts in the coming weeks and months.
[…and it can only help to be having dinner with the Trump and Starmer last week!]

On this basis, I believe we will see £20 / $27 within the next 12 months =  70%+ higher than we are here.  And longer term it’ll be multiples of where it is today. And it is all backed up by real results - real revenues, real profit, and real deals worth billions.

1nk42gb,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 05:56:10,Microstrategy is one of the worst investments to own,"I’ve been following MicroStrategy for a while now, and after the latest moves I felt I had to dig deeper. The more I looked, the more it reinforced my view that this company is basically the most dangerous way to own Bitcoin. A few things stood out:

The premium is collapsing. MSTR used to trade at 2–3x the value of the Bitcoin it held. That gap has shrunk dramatically, and without that premium the whole “intelligent leverage” model stops working.

Dilution has gone into overdrive. They’ve raised tens of billions this year alone through share sales and preferred stock. The share count has nearly doubled in months.
The preferreds are Ponzi-like. Proceeds from new offerings are explicitly allowed to be used to pay dividends on the old ones. That’s not sustainable.

Michael Saylor’s “never sell Bitcoin” mantra ignores risk. It’s fine as a meme, but as a corporate policy it’s insane. If Bitcoin takes a typical 70–80% drawdown, the debt and dividend obligations wipe out the equity.
Even skeptics like Jim Chanos flagged this. He called it a “perpetual motion machine of dilution,” and watching the last few months play out, it really does look that way.

Here's the post if you want the full breakdown with a 15 minute podcast (charts, filings, stress-tests, etc.): https://open.substack.com/pub/tscsw/p/avoid-microstrategy-inc-the-bitcoin?r=203zi2&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true

It honestly feels less like a Bitcoin play and more like a house of cards that only stood up as long as people were willing to pay a crazy premium. Now that premium is eroding, is this the beginning of the end for MSTR?

Curious what others here think - am I being too harsh, or is this as structurally broken as it looks?

40 days ago i told you JAMF is undervalued at a price around 7$. Now we are at 11$, or +60%. My price target is 14$ and it looks like the company gets acquired next couple of months, so 14$ is very likely.

See: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/XCqdRqThKD

32 days ago i told you BILL is undervalued at a price around 40$. Now we are at 52$, or +30%. I still believe this is just the beginning and my price target is 80$. After that recently Starboard Value built big stake in BILL - im not the only one who thinks BILL is undervalued.

See: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/qnm9Xn54xN

Oh, and this one i like the most. 1 year ago i told you Unity Software is undervalued at 16$ and my price target was 32$. Guess where we are today. U trades around 45$ or +190%.

See: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/laZRsD54qU

Here is my new stock which i consider undervalued.

SPT - Sprout Social SPT has a social media management software and trades around 14$ right now. My price target is around 25$ within next 6 months.

Fundamentals SPT:
- Social media gets more and more important for companies.
- SPT has the best software to manage social media and they are the market leaders
- They changed CEO last year and current CEO is targeting more larger companies as customers instead of influencers. Customers >50k revenue grew 40% recently, one example is Honda which is now a customer
- CEO and board members announced that they will start insider buying end of this year, as they consider the stock to be undervalued (see SPT SEC Filing 08/26/2025).
- Yesterday Needham maintained their buy rating and price target 32$ after a meeting with SPT
- They recently announced a collaboration with Canva to streamline design to publish process

SPT has a marketcap around 800Million USD. Sprinklr has a marketcap around 1.9Billion USD. Klaviyo has a marketcap around 9.5Billion USD.

Sprinklr is comparable, but not as easy to use. Customers perfer Sprout because of that.

Klaviyo shows, if an email management software company is valued at almost 10Billion USD, how can a social media management software company only be worth 10% of that.

My price target sits around 25$ until January 26.",150,110,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nj6rlk/i_gave_you_jamf_and_u_here_is_my_new_play/,month,Stock Analysis,0.9

… catalyst to herald the giddy 1999. 

——

I have already deleted the reply to a post yesterday, asking “if we were heading to a recession?”. 

It feels like 1998, people are more or less convinced of the “internet” but there are naysayers too. And brick and mortar companies know that they need to evolve, but many do not know how. 

1999 was when everything went boozy and the nasdaq doubled in a year. There were record m&a activities, record number of Dot-com IPOS and the future was very bright indeed. My company was advertising itself as the dot in the dot com. To justify the nose-bleed valuations, some sell-side analysts resorted to eyeball clicks as a legitimate metric. Consumer staples were seen as staid and Berkshire Hathaway seemed antiquated. ( **“What's Wrong, Warren?”** https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB945992010127068546 )

It was peak optimism until March 2000. Then the market started to go down. And the maximum pessimism was the sept 11 2001 attack on the twin towers. Accounting fraud were discovered at Enron, world com and others. 

The market didn’t start to recover until 2003.

So today’s market feels listless, very much like 1998. I wrote yesterday that perhaps Oracle’s announcement that its revenue will soon reach half a trillion due to Ai is the catalysts needed to kick start 1999.

[Today I saw the headline in Barron’s  “Oracle May Be Having Its Nvidia Moment. Or It Could Be a Repeat of 1999.”](https://www.barrons.com/articles/oracle-stock-price-nvidia-b301a32f)

Hmmmmm

*( additional comment: my post isn’t a call to short the market or the Oracle stock. I feel that as long as we continue to buy things that are not overvalued and are of a reasonable quality, it will turn out fine in the long run. I think the market will run up a lot more before we find a reversion to the mean)*

However, if you look closely into Waste Management (WM), it is one of the most durable compounding machines in the U.S. economy. On the surface, it looks like basic trash collection, landfill ownership, and recycling. But under the surface is an almost impossible moat to replicate:

High barriers to entry - New landfills are extraordinarily difficult to permit, regulate, and finance. The existing network of WM is an irreplaceable asset.

Pricing power with inflation pass-through - Many contracts allow them to alter rates automatically, while still protecting margins.

Capital allocation discipline - WM will consistently return free cash flow via dividends and buybacks, but continues to reinvest to become more efficient.

This is a business that thrives in the background of daily life. While investors are lining up stocks for the next tech disruptor, Waste Management is compounding wealth by managing something that society literally cannot live without.

1nqzyr0,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 08:25:42,Is Google Stock a Still Bargain? 10-Year Return Expectations,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better.

However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it.

When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value.  
After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years.

From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500.

Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations.

Anyways here are the results:

FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR  
EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR  
Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR

So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price?  
Probably not.

Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs.

That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding.

Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels.

For me this is a clear hold.

I was invested in ASTS for almost a year, but I sold all of my shares after the run up in June.

I’ve done a lot of DD in them and I believe in their technology but I believe that circumstances have changed in past few months and that has reflected on the SP.

They’ve diluted their shareholders quite a few times in last few months earning them around 1 billion dollars, but that is necessary to keep the company running as they burned about 400 million dollars in Q2 (around 320 million capex spending) and those numbers will only go up.

They will need further dilution to fund their operations because even after all of these dilutions they have enough cash for only 2 quarters.

Their main issue is the fact that they are constantly delaying satellite launches. They’ve planed to launch 20 satellites in 2025 but it is now clear that they will not launch a single satellite this year.

The first satellite (FM 1) was meant to launch in march of 2025, but it has now been delayed to Q1 of 2026 and we can’t be sure that they will deliver that promise.

Constant delays are a catastrophe for them as their tech superiority is shrinking (competition from star link is getting more and more of a serious problem), it also hurts confidence of the investors and makes it hard to believe that they will deliver their promises.

SP has now reached the levels of my exit price and I planed to reinvest but I’ve lost confidence in them.

You do not need to guess at what will reset the valuation. We just need to recognize that there is enough of a business there that a rest can reasonably happen. 

Did I buy INTC? No. The negative FCF and strategy challenges kept me away. But the business was trading at a huge discount to history and its own balance sheet. It would only take small changes to create a large share price change. I had other opportunities I chose instead, for good or bad.

1ntszqs,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 16:25:28,Forget the hype: This is where I am invested today,"First of all: AI is a fart in the wind (the way it is today). I work as a scientist for a large US tech company where management tries to enforce AI. But literally nobody uses AI tools. Or should I say, nobody has become more productive with existing tools. It takes more time to correct codes generated than writing from scratch or leveraging existing codes. It does help here and there, but NOTHING disruptive. I save maybe 3h of work per week, and I am being super generous. Not even talking about the infinite revenue loop created between the main AI actors. Time reveals everything, and this is no exception.

Now, there have been several posts on '*where to invest today? what are your strong picks in a period of ATH?*' So writing here where I have invested a large portion of my value portfolio, waiting patiently that money flows back. 

  
Here it is: **US insurance providers**. I have USD 110k invested as of today. Why? PE lower than usual, high revenue growth and money likely rotated from the sector to stupid AI. I have collected the best ones (according to me) such that you do not have to. 

Criteria: low PE (and lower than usual), high and consistent revenue growth, profitable, growing or constant margins, continuous stock price increase with a decrease in the last year (so not ATH), large cap:

* Chubb
* PGR
* ACGL
* AJG (okay PE is does not match the criteria above, but it systematicall increases over time with performance, so still invested in)
* Optional: TRV
* UNH
* ELV

**High risk (not fitting the above criteria, but could go to the moon):**

* LMND
* ROOT

Cherry on the cake: such portfolio has outperformed the SP500 in the last decade while being less affected during downturn periods. Insurance is not going anywhere, it is a necessity that grows with demographics and increased frequency of large events. Sector has underperformed but money will come back.

WSJ EXCLUSIVE

By Lauren Thomas, Ben Dummett and Benoît Morenne

Sept. 30, 2025 3:49 pm ET

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is in talks to buy Occidental Petroleum’s petrochemical business for around $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal, which would be Berkshire’s largest since 2022, could come together within days, the people said. 

Houston-based Occidental is largely known for its oil-and-gas operations. The company has a market value of around $46 billion and already counts Berkshire as its largest shareholder. 

Occidental’s petrochemical division, OxyChem, manufactures and sells chemicals for use in applications including chlorinating water, recycling batteries and producing paper. The unit generated nearly $5 billion in sales in the 12 months ended in June. 

Assuming talks don’t fall apart, the OxyChem deal would be Buffett’s second big bet on chemicals. In 2011, Berkshire acquired specialty-chemicals producer, Lubrizol, for close to $10 billion, including debt. 

The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Occidental was in talks for a $10 billion deal to sell OxyChem, without identifying the buyer. The last major deal Berkshire did was in 2022, when it agreed to pay $11.6 billion to buy insurer Alleghany. 

Buffett, 95, got involved with Occidental in 2019, as Chief Executive Vicki Hollub was trying to outbid Chevron to buy Anadarko Petroleum. In a trip facilitated by Bank of America Chief Brian Moynihan, Hollub traveled to Nebraska to visit Buffett, whose company agreed to buy $10 billion of preferred shares in Occidental to bolster her $38 billion offer. 

Occidental’s fortunes have waxed and waned since then. The deal saddled the company with debt and attracted criticism from activist investor Carl Icahn. Buffett doubled down as Icahn exited, eventually buying up roughly 28% of its shares. The company’s shares more recently have come under pressure with oil prices lower.

Occidental has been selling noncore assets to raise cash to pay down debt. As of August, it said it had repaid $7.5 billion of debt. 

Berkshire, on the other hand, has been sitting on a massive cash pile. The company’s cash and Treasury bills sat at a record $344 billion at the end of June, raising investors’ eyebrows.

Buffett has said the company still prefers owning businesses, though has suggested that finding the right ones to buy can be hard. “Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned,” Buffett wrote earlier this year. 

The famed investor plans to retire from his role as CEO at the end of the year and hand the reins to Greg Abel. Buffett will remain chairman.",110,31,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nuojke/berkshire_hathaway_near_10_billion_deal_for/,month,Buffett,0.98

1nirc35,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 15:33:21,Share your “hidden“ gems,"Let’s put together a thread of our favourite overlooked value stock ideas. Share the small and mid caps that are under appreciated for whatever reason. Maybe they are listed in an often overlooked market or they have a moat in an industry that no one looks at but you know a lot about. Let’s share some ideas, so we can get some new ideas to research.

I’ll start with 2:

SBO (formerly Schöller Bleckmann Oilfield), they make, as the name implies, primarily equipment for the Energy sector, they are a world market leader in these kinds of a-magnetic steel applications. They are listed in Austria’s ATX index, as they are currently facing a lot of potentially headwinds (from tariffs to a lower oil price) the current share price might be an interesting entry point. They are financially sound, with reasonable margins and have been in the process of diversifying from oilfield for few years (hence the name change). Their technology advantage gives them an edge, but they are still heavily exposed to the oil industry.

Rosenbauer
another Austrian company, they make fire engines and firefighting equipment, and are a market leader in this (admittedly relatively narrow) segment. While their R&D and build quality is top notch, they have struggled in the past to keep their numbers in line. They had to receive a significant cash injection recently from a consortium lead by Mark Mateschitz ( of Red Bull), which has propped up their share price as well. At the current price of 46,50 it’s probably fairly valued with still some upside potential, but if the temporary headwinds (tarrifs, weak dollar, etc) continue towards the end of the year, it could present an entry point into a company that’s now got the cash to seriously build on a solid foundation in a potentially growing market.",105,129,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nirc35/share_your_hidden_gems/,month,Discussion,0.92

A lot of you seem convinced neutron will succeed first try, and i doubt that will happen. Even if it achieves partial success, I wouldn’t be surprised if the stock plummets.

If anything, I suspect it’ll turn into a LUNR situation where despite achieving most objectives and getting valuable data, the stock still plummets like crazy because investors don’t get what space is and what it isn’t. 

I would say because of that, it’s currently overvalued. Its current product, electron, while successful, has a very small market and does not warrant RKLB’s current valuation. Everything about neutron is speculative and practically nothing is set in stone unless you go and fly that thing. Yeah I think neutron will eventually succeed in some form, but don’t be surprised if they have to readjust targets and their testing campaign goes on for years

1nglvjf,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 04:29:34,Concise checklist to follow if you decide to practice Billionaire Charlie Munger’s WCAFP School of Value Investing,"Addressed to newbies and less experienced investors in this Subreddit.

Here is a high-level concise checklist to follow if you decide to practice Billionaire Charlie Munger WCAFP School of Value Investing / Quality Investing / GARP Investing (all 3 are similar) as it has worked out well for me:

1) see 5 years of ROIC & ROA on Morningstar for the stock you are interested in
2) next see the 5 years of ROIC & ROA for all major competitors of company behind the stock you are interested in to gauge how the company is doing compared to its industry peers

3) Read the SEC-10K / annual report by examining: 

A) Balance Sheet - Avoid companies with excessively high debt-to-equity ratios unless it's an industry norm. Preferably the company can pay off its debt with 2-5 years of earnings—not cash flow. Is the company buying back shares of their stock when it is undervalued - focus on monetary sum and the timing involved

 B) Income Statement - Does profit margins (EBIT, Net Income/ Net Profit) belong to the Top Quartile in the industry & increasing or at minimum stable over the last 5 to 10 years ? The exception is called in finance as a turnaround stock

C) Look at the notes to the financial statements for share dilutions & company management actions about share options given to them - whether they exercise it and at what price. 

D) Look at the cash flow statement - is it in line with management actions of what they announced they plan to do 
-are the company being fiscally prudent in tough economic times by  prioritising payment of debts 
-are the company management spending substantially on R&D consistently over the last few years if R&D is crucial to their competitive advantage 
- does cash flow from operations indicate a healthy underlying business despite negative news in the media 

E) look at management notes to shareholders 
- is it written in a manner that is easy for shareholders to understand what the company management is planning for the future 
- is there candid discussion of mistakes made in terms of new products / services launched, M&A etc 
- does company management take credit for large company successes that can visibly be attributed to a very good economic situation


4) Assess the quality of management and their integrity and whether are their actions truly beneficial to shareholders or are they going on an empire-building exercise. Examine their remuneration system for Top Management and their level of remuneration compared to others in the same industry.

5)Determine whether the company  
has a narrow or wide moat. If you are not sure, use Morningstar model through a subscription. 

6)Do a DCF financial modeling using conservative assumptions- you can use finance professor aswath damodaran financial model template - FCFFGinzu. Note that you need to use other financial modeling methods for certain types of companies.

 7) ask yourself what actions can the company’s management do to destroy its business - write down there on paper or in the notes app on your phone and reexamine the annual report / SEC 13-K for such actions whether explicit or implicit. If there are lack of multiple red flags, then move on to the next step.

8)Invest in the stock if it’s at a significant discount to a conservatively calculated intrinsic value

 9)Reassess your investment thesis once a year - keep your winners for decades. The time to sell is if A) your investment thesis was wrong, B) the moat is deteriorating, or C) you find a vastly better opportunity. The market can ignore a great business for far longer than three years. If you've bought a wonderful business at a fair price, you should want to hold it through periods of underperformance, perhaps even buy more.

For instance, UNH and NVO have recently declined in price, and many contributors argue that their current valuations suggest a strong potential for recovery. While this perspective has merit, there are some important caveats. These are large-cap, well-known stocks, so their price movements typically offer returns in the range of 2x to 3x. That’s certainly a respectable return, but it overlooks the fact that small-cap stocks often offer greater upside potential due to their higher volatility.

  
Given this fact, let's shift the discussion toward small-cap stocks. In the comments, instead of just listing ticker symbols, let’s include the company name, a brief one-line summary of what the company does, why we believe it has potential (i.e. if the products are amazingly good, if population trend is moving towards such products, etc.), and whether the current valuation supports the investment thesis.",91,146,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nff0ow/small_cap_stocks_with_huge_potential/,month,Discussion,0.96
1nc9k5p,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 00:28:31,Is NVO really undervalued? Patent expiry is a nightmare fuel.,"Facts:

1. NVO is almost entirely dependent on the semaglutide patent, which is what its anti obesity and anti diabetes drugs are based on.

2. NVO patent for many international countries, including China, Canada, Brazil, Turkey, etc. is expiring in 2026. These countries are estimated to have 33% of the obesity population. 

3. The US and EU patent is expiring in 2031, which is a 6 years window for NVO. 

4. Adoption rate of obesity drugs in the USA is 3% today. This is forecast to grow to 20% by 2035. (Not so much a fact than a forecast) 

5. Eli Lily has a better drugs compared to NVO.

6. There is a supply constraint as demand is exceeding what NVO can supply.

6. NVO is investing heavily into pharma manufacturing capacity to solve its supply constraint. 

Takeaway:
NVO is likely to lose the international market to generic manufacturers. 

However, high margin demand will still be strong in the US and EU until 2031, and can potentially multiply many times over for NVO. 

NVO has a 6 year window to capitalise on this high margin demand growth, thus its investments into manufacturing capacity to capture as much of it as possible until its patent expires.

Questions:

Why is NVO indicating a single digit growth rate over the next few years when adoption rate for its type of drugs is expected to multiply over the next few years? 

How will the margin compression due to generics impact NVO’s financials? ",91,103,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nc9k5p/is_nvo_really_undervalued_patent_expiry_is_a/,month,Stock Analysis,0.77

1nvlhpb,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 17:42:51,"Most people are better off being ""growth"" investors (including this sub)","I'm not sure if this will be insightful or dumb, but this is Reddit so there's no reason to concern myself with that... 

I think most individual investors that feel the need to buy single stocks are probably better off being what most here would describe as ""growth"" investors. (I don't agree with growth vs. value being a binary split, because growth is obviously a component of value). The market today isn't filled with net-nets (there are some), cigar butts, and stocks that trade at a discount to book or replacement/sale value. Those that do are often hard to find, messy and difficult to analyze. So you need to have a view on the future and growth prospects (it's not just pure speculation as Graham said so I don't wanna hear that).

I think most stock pickers are better off focusing on strong businesses that are growing and having more flexibility on P/E ratios rather than trying to find ""value"" based on stocks that have tanked recently. A large portion of this sub loves low P/E stocks or those down 30+% and overlook fundamental challenges simply because the stock went down and now it appears ""value."" You can put whatever stock du jour is the most talked about in this sub in that category most of the time... occasionally popular stocks here bounce back strongly, but I'm inclined to believe that may be more luck than skill... unless someone has a mention tracker going for testing... 

Those same folks look down on all the higher multiple stocks that the market loves that are strong and growing businesses. **I am not talking about the highest multiple or meme/hype stocks**, just quality businesses that people know and are most likely going to experience future success but trade at multiples around the broader market or \~25% premiums. There are so many commenters here that overlook quality and hate a company that's trading at or near all time highs and think they're smarter than the market. They also think they're smarter than the market after a recent drop and think that recent ""cheapness"" equates to value. **You hate that people buy stocks just because they went up, but do the exact same thing and buy stocks just because they went down**. Momentum is a powerful force especially with trading volumes mostly driven by passive and levered pod shops. You're fighting against that when you buy a recently tanked stocks, at least those picking ""obvious"" businesses have those as tailwinds. 

I think most people would be better off investing in ""obvious"" strong, growing companies even if everyone else loves them rather than focusing all their attention on things that have fallen and probably subjecting yourself to a lot of value traps. Great businesses have a tendency to surprise on the upside and their execution and I believe those going through issues and turnarounds have a tendency to surprise on the downside. This entire spiel I doubt many will read **does not apply to anyone who will take the time to deeply understand a business, it's economics, strength, and potential for the future** I just don't see a lot of that here (to be clear **I'm not claiming to have that ability either**...). 

If you want to buy some single stocks, but aren't going to make a career out of it the ""obvious"" ones might be your friend. I'd rather be consensus and right than contrarian and wrong... buy stocks because the business is strong and it's a reasonable price, don't fall in love with only a lower price. If you're absolutely must call yourself a value investor so you can look down on others without actually putting in the work just buy Berkshire Hathaway and call it a day... 

Anyway, subscribe to my stock tips, buy quantum computing, Palantir, ASTS, and DJT. Kidding, don't buy any of that shit now unless you're gambling.

I'm particularly interested in names like UnitedHealth trading at 15x earnings despite their dominant market position, or PayPal at 14x with an 18.9% return on capital employed. Even in overseas markets, you've got Taiwan Semiconductor at 27x earnings while basically owning the advanced chip manufacturing game with 90%+ market share. These aren't distressed situations, they're quality businesses temporarily out of favor.

TLDR - AI's leveling the playing field, removes some of the time intensive research that goes into investing.

Article:

The Golden Age of Value Investing Is Over

It used to take hard work and an ear for scuttlebutt to gain an edge, but now AI has leveled the playing field. Is that a bad thing? 

For 30 years, my advantage as an investor was painstaking research. AI just made it worthless.
In 1995, I read two books that changed my life: Benjamin Graham’s The Intelligent Investor and Roger Lowenstein’s biography of Warren Buffett. I was hooked on value investing. I could not get enough of it. In those days, however, getting enough of it was hard. It was the infancy of the internet, so it wasn’t as if I could just Google “Warren Buffett” or “value investing.”


The first thing I could get my hands on was Berkshire Hathaway’s annual report. I had to look up the phone number in the phone directory. After that, I placed a phone call using a landline. A nice lady with a Midwestern accent picked up the phone, “Berkshire Hathaway — how can I help you?”


“Hello,” I said. “I’d like to order a copy of your annual report.” That’ll be no problem, came the answer. I gave her my mailing address, and she repeated it back to me. A few days later, I received a brown envelope with the annual report. I devoured it. And I used the table of Berkshire’s publicly traded investments to go after new materials — the reports of Coca-Cola, Geico, American Express and Capital Cities/ABC — in a similar fashion, by picking up a landline phone and making a verbal request.
What’s my point?


Things went slowly. Acquiring knowledge was hard. Every step in the acquisition of investing knowledge involved a cycle of days, if not weeks. The various pieces had to be carefully assembled and assiduously harvested.


From those early days, I learned about the Berkshire Hathaway meetings. They were not recorded for YouTube or televised live. So, I acquired some shares and attended them in person. All in pursuit of an investing edge. Yes — there were a few lucky non-attendees of those meetings who managed to get onto Whitney Tilson’s famous email list — which at the time numbered dozens at most. But that was it. The inside tracks were few and far between.
Because I could not get enough, I also attended the Wesco meetings in Pasadena, California with Charlie Munger, and the Sequoia Fund meetings run by Bill Ruane and Rick Cunniff. Once at the Wesco meeting, Munger mentioned the Tupperware company in the context of Robert Cialdini’s Influence:The Psychology of Persuasion. I was on it. I even organized a Tupperware party in my home to understand how the company’s sales system worked.


In those days, potential investors in my fund used to ask, “What’s your edge?” Perhaps it was a shorthand for “Do you have a source of inside information?” Or, more politely, “What’s your variant insight?” If I had any at all, it was based on this sort of scuttlebutt.
But that world is now gone.


Over the last decade many of those advantages have been eroded. Pounding the pavement, smiling and dialing were no longer necessary. Because those hard-earned insights were being emailed, tweeted, livestreamed, YouTubed, podcasted and more. Yes, you still had to pick your sources. But there was so much more that was simply available at the tips of any analyst’s fingers.


And now comes AI. The way investment research changed in the internet age was glacially slow when compared to the earthquake that is LLMs. Before ChatGPT, you still had to have the patience to assemble and read through the mosaic of sources. Now you can just ask ChatGPT or Gemini to do all the trawling. An LLM can give an instant summary of all that has been said in the public domain about a company. And it can be instantly analyzed to provide the current state of wisdom on the topic.
Granted, the LLMs cannot, to the best of my knowledge, generate original thinking. But the path to original thoughts is so much shorter — and so much more accessible.


In past times, I used to make a point of traveling to the Kings Road in London on the off chance that Nick Sleep and Qais Zakaria of Nomad might treat me to a Cornish pasty along with some of their original thoughts. It was there that I first heard Nick talk about “scale economies shared.” Today there is no need for me to travel all that distance — unless I am only after the Cornish pasty and Nick and Zak’s fine company.


Why? So many original thoughts or variant opinions are available online and the LLMs can trawl through all of them — adding in and cross-referencing a mosaic of additional sources: social media posts, SEC filings and more. That material is all now public domain.


It’s true that there are still many nonpublic data sources that are not accessible by LLMs. But data tends to leak out via Scribd, Reddit, arXiv or social media. Even if that’s just metadata, it can be assembled effortlessly. Then a human like me can apply intuition and fact-check the sources to make sure the LLM is not hallucinating.


What does this mean for value investing?
My conclusion is that the golden age of value investing is well and truly over. Thanks to the LLMs, I have no need for a junior analyst: At a fraction of the cost, an LLM can do a far better job. And the era of the swashbuckling hedge fund manager — Michael Steinhardt, George Soros, Julian Robertson — is also gone.


Asset pricing will become more accurate. Hidden subtleties about a particular business that make it either better or worse than it appears will be more easily revealed. The return on better analysis and better insight will diminish because it will be available to all. The British scientist and writer Matt Ridley would liken this to the Red Queen effect: We can all run faster, but at the end of the day, we will all have access to the same LLMs. The dispersion of returns for active management has to reduce, clustering even closer to the index return, even for investors who don’t closet index.


People used to ask, “What’s your edge?”, but there is no edge anymore. At least, none that is obvious to me.


Where, then, will money flow? What remains are index funds and asset-gatherers like BlackRock. And what of small, independent boutique funds like mine? We can stick to human behaviors that work — which the indexers and the quant funds with their large organizations and programmed behavior cannot replicate. We can buy and hold, which is sometimes called time arbitrage.


I will certainly continue to invest in scuttlebutt, LLM channel checks, expert calls and the like. But I know that it will probably be futile. Because everyone can do it. I expect my attention to turn to building the best set of relationships, and to invest in businesses that themselves invest in better sets of relationships.
For this I can think of no better example than Berkshire Hathaway - with its vast number of shareholders. That's a large group who have the lived experience that buying and holding for the long term, rather than chopping and changing, is the way to invest. That will give Buffett's successor, Greg Abel, a far better environment to allocate capital - just as my investor base should afford me the same. I know it's slim pickings, but it should be enough for those of us who remain.


If the only thing AI and LLM's do for finance is to level the playing field - to further marginalize the masters of the universe (and wannabees like me) - would that be such a bad thing? Most likely not.


Thanks to AI, the playing field is more level than it's ever been. Now more than ever there is no need for the average investor to have to pay outrageous fees. A big benefit of the stock market was democratize finance. Perhaps, now, thanks to AI, that day is finally here.",77,76,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkmlfe/the_golden_age_of_value_investing_is_over_guy/,month,Discussion,0.89

GOGO - in flight comms for military/gov aviation. 22 Forward free cash flow, TTM revenue doubled, FCF tripled. Future growth is close to mid/high single digits but still possibly good value.  



ASTH - physician focused AI providing care coordination. Trading at 11 forward PE and 0.6X sales. TTM rev growth was 50% and next years estimates is +26%. With faster net income and FCF growth. 



PDFS - data solutions for semiconductor systems. Trading at 18 FPE and 3.5x sales. 20% rev growth this year and estimated for the next two years. 




AROC - energy infrastructure focused on midstream NG. Trading at 13x pwe and 4.7X sales. TTM rev growth over 25% with net income growth of 60%. With next few year rec growth estimated at high single digits and net income growth in the low to mid teens. Also has a 3% dividend



ADUS - provides home care, like hospice which I expect to grow with our aging population. Trading at 17x fpe and 1.5x sales. 20% growth and high single digits next few years which I expect to continue for a long time as population ages. 




PLMR - property and casualty insurance. Trading at 16fpe with 20% growth. Not a huge fan of insurance personally so won’t look more but maybe someone here likes it. 



ENVA - online financial services focused on small businesses and consumers. Trading at 11 fpe, has 50% net income growth and over 20% rev growth. I already have a lot banking and financial services so not looking deeper.



AIR - aftermarket aerospace parts and solutions. Trading at a 14 fpe. Not the highest rev growth with it expected to be mid to high single digits over the next few years, but margin improvements are looking tasty. 



UPBD - tech/data financial solutions company. Trading at a 5 fpe. 7-8% even growth and stronger margins over the next few years, also has a 6.6% dividend. 




IDCC - r&d tech company focused on video, wireless and AI. 




PRGS - AI digital experiences and infrastructure company. Trading at a fpe of 7. Strong expected growth in 2025 but the estimated growth the next few years is in the low single digits. High margins and if they get a solid product may have huge potential, neeed to research the products they have. 




These aren’t recommendations and I don’t own any of them, yet. But they are intriguing and I’ll do more research. I was getting a little downcast thinking everything is expensive and this sub posts crazy stocks all the time then some guy asking about 100x or 1000x picks which got me thinking small caps, so with a little research I found there are still plenty of value options that also have growth.

Came across [BigBear.ai](http://BigBear.ai) (BBAI) in some random article a while back and started watching it. At first it just looked like another AI penny stock, but the more I checked their numbers, the more it stood out.

They’re not just chasing hype, they actually have contracts in defense, logistics, and identity stuff. Last quarter wasn’t pretty, but it wasn’t bad either, and they at least managed to beat expectations. That gave me enough reason to keep it on the radar.

Then the Goldman Sachs news hit. They boosted their stake by almost 570% and now hold over 2.3 million shares. A couple other institutions piled in too. Seeing that kind of money step up made me take this way more seriously.

Other Hedge Funds & Institution**s Increasing Stakes in BBAI**

* **Rhumbline Advisers** – boosted holdings by over 18%.
* **NewEdge Advisors** – increased their stake by more than 440%.
* **Mirae Asset Global ETFs** – added \~160,000 shares, bringing their total close to half a million.
* **AQR Capital Management** – opened a brand-new position.

Together with Goldman Sachs’ 569% increase, these moves pushed institutional ownership to over 7.5% of BBAI’s float. That’s not a trivial number for what many still call an “AI penny stock.” It shows there’s serious money starting to pile in.

So now I’m stuck thinking, do I jump in at these levels, or wait and see if it cools off? It’s still a $2B market cap, super volatile, but if the contracts keep coming it could be one of those names that looks obvious in hindsight.

Unemployment and consumer spending can signal the direction of the economy. Some believe more nebulous data points hold clues too.

From Labubus **(1)** and men’s underwear to lipstick and skirt hems, signs pointing to or away from a recession are everywhere.

Whether they’re accurate indicators of the economy's health is another matter.

Here’s how recessions are actually defined: A committee with the National Bureau of Economic Research **(2)** that maintains a chronology of US business cycles pores over official monthly releases from government agencies, like employment and income data, to date periods that represent a “significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.”

That process can take a while. In June 2020, for example, the NBER declared the country had entered a recession **(3)** in February of that year — an unusually fast determination. In July 2021, the NBER said **(4)** the country had exited the recession in April 2020. **(5)**

Otherwise, experts turn to other reliable, albeit unofficial, recession signs, including two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, or the “Sahm rule,” **(6)** which finds the start of a recession occurs when the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate rises 0.5 percentage points or more, relative to its 12-month low.

Now, with consumer sentiment tanking, inflation ticking higher, the job market stagnating — and social media users speculating that short, bare nails **(7)** herald economic malaise — here are other less-than-traditional measures to watch.

Cardboard boxes

Cardboard box demand is sometimes seen as an indicator of economic health, since the majority of what consumers purchase touches corrugated cardboard. Here’s the not-so-great news: Right now, US box makers are cutting back on production, ** (8)** said Jadrian Wooten, an economist at Virginia Tech. Box shipments are also down.


“I love this recession indicator, or I guess potential indicator, because it is such a common item that I think a lot of people take it for granted,” Wooten said.

Even former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan reportedly used to track cardboard prices. **(9)**

“The cardboard box industry is incredibly large — we’re talking close to $100 billion in revenue,” Wooten said. “What I always tell my students at Virginia Tech is that it’s four times as big as the NFL, and they hear about the NFL every day, on TV, on social media, there are video games about it. We don’t have that about the cardboard box industry. It’s so much more important.”

Many US boxes are shipped abroad, and exports are expected to weaken amid trade tensions, **(10)** which could help explain lower packaging demand. US consumer spending, which has so far remained resilient, may also grind lower as prices rise, dimming the need for tons of shipments.

Right now, the cardboard story is also one about capacity, Wooten said, with multiple plants being taken offline in the most dramatic cuts since the Great Recession.

All of this taking place before the holiday shopping season is doubly concerning.

“This is actually the peak time for the holiday season that we would expect to see ramp-ups in cardboard box production happening,” Wooten said. “That’s probably the biggest concern in terms of a pending recession: Companies are not ordering cardboard boxes to put their products in to then send to Target or Walmart for the holiday season.”


If looks could indicate

Americans have long sought to tease economic signals from fashion and style choices. It’s been said, for example, that skirt hemlines lengthen, natural roots start to show, men’s underwear goes unreplaced, and clothes grow more muted during an economic downturn.

It’s also been said, however, that many of those “indicators” are far from reliable. The hemline index in particular has been debunked **(11)** — midi skirts trended in 2019, for example, when economic conditions were otherwise solid, and micro-mini skirts trended around the time the dot-com bubble burst.


And it was Greenspan, again, who told NPR **(12)** that a dip in men’s underwear sales could be indicative of a troubled economy.

But is it?

“I cover Hanesbrands and Gildan, which both make underwear, and I can tell you that nobody at either company has ever told me that,” said David Swartz, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar.

“Greenspan was totally blindsided by the economic crisis in 2008, so clearly his underwear indicator did not help him, did it?” Swartz added.

During times of economic hardship, retailers may say consumers are becoming more “choiceful"" **(13)** or discerning in their purchases.

“It doesn’t mean that they don’t spend, it just means that they aren’t necessarily spending on things as they would if the economy was in better shape,” Swartz said.

The 'little treat' economy

A few months after the 9/11 attacks — at which point the US was already in a recession — Leonard Lauder, then the chairman of the Estée Lauder Companies, said ""when things get tough, women buy lipstick,” according to a Guardian report from the time. **(14)**

""In stressful times, many consumers are reaching out for those small indulgences that provide momentary pleasure,” Lauder said.

This sentiment started being referred to as the “Lipstick Index,” and it somewhat tracks with the idea of today’s “little treat economy,” or the rise of people indulging in more affordable pick-me-ups (an iced coffee, maybe, or a cute keychain) as a form of self-care.

“I don’t know that there’s any clear evidence that women decide to buy more lipstick because they feel bad about the economy or something like that,” Swartz said. “My opinion would be that when there’s a recession, people cut back on everything, and that probably includes lipstick.”

More indicative of economic conditions, perhaps, is whether or not people are going out to eat, which is generally more expensive than cooking at home. And restaurant traffic is indeed on the decline, **(15)** with the cost of food away from home up 3.9% in the past year. **(16)**


“You can also look at things like sales in discount versus sales in department stores,” Swartz said. “We’ve seen much stronger results from retailers like TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack and Ross compared to department stores. We’ve also seen weakness in the luxury space.”

Giant skeletons

Sean Bagniewski, a Democratic state representative in Iowa serving the Des Moines area, posited in a newsletter he sent in August that the apparent lackluster demand for giant, 12-foot skeleton sales at Home Depot could suggest economic rain clouds ahead.

He has his own “Skelly” and noted that “there are lively Facebook groups that focus on this and other Home Depot Halloween items each season.” Despite retailing for $299, they often sell out fast when they hit stores. And, since Home Depot (HD) did not do a spring sale of Halloween decorations this year, Bagniewski told Yahoo Finance, it seemed likely that August’s decoration drop would generate a lot of interest.

“Though I have one, I was curious to watch how the Skellies got snapped up when they were released at about 5:15 one morning earlier this month,” he wrote. **(17)** “In 2023, all of them were purchased within the hour. In 2024, all of them were gone by noon. This year, there were more than 3,000 that were still available on the Home Depot site 13 hours after they were released.”

“That’s not as fancy as Greenspan economics, but I’d say it’s interesting anecdotal evidence that folks are feeling a pinch in their pocketbooks,” he added.

A spokesperson for Home Depot said they couldn’t “share any sales specifics around any products,” though “we continue to see fans embracing Skelly into their Halloween collections.”

As of the morning of Sept. 23, Skellies remain in stock. **(18)** Indeed, some commenters noted in a Facebook group devoted to Home Depot’s Halloween products that they had tighter budgets this year or were waiting for discounts, though others spent thousands of dollars on decorations.

Still, Bagniewski sees red flags when families scale back on luxury items that make their kids happy.

“If people aren’t buying those — and it’s been a hot-ticket item in past years — then that should be somewhat of a warning sign,” Bagniewski said.

Let me know your views on this,Sorry if this goes too long. Tried to be precise.  
  
UNH's Medicare Advantage business is their cash cow...Pulled in $139B last year it is built on a foundation of straight up fraud: upcoding, where the company inflates patient diagnoses to trick the government into overpaying!  
We are talking about logging healthy seniors as having severe and life threatening conditions...they dont even have, pocketing extra reimbursements for sicker patients who never even needed the care. Investigative journalism found out billions of claims from 2019-2021 and uncovered $50B in industrywide fraud, with UNH as the main leader, billing for hundreds of thousands questionable diagnoses like deadly illnesses that patients couldn’t possibly have...Not to sound very woke here, But it's taxpayer money siphoned straight into executive bonuses and stock buybacks while grandma's premiums skyrocket.  
  
\-In May 2025: The DOJ healthcare fraud unit is interviewing ex employees,doctors and whistleblowers about whether UNH pressured providers to fudge claims...boosting payments by billions. And after all that we got to know that its not just bad accounting...its potential criminal fraud, with prosecutors grilling folks on how UNH revises diagnosis codes to increase claim values. Shares tanked 13-20% on the news alone, and UNH's response? ""We're cooperating"" while hiding behind ""independent audits"" that conveniently say they're accurate. A court-appointed special master in a prior case already smelled the rot, but the DOJ's pushing forward because the evidence is overwhelming.",65,87,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwwuk9/a_dive_in_unhs_great_fall_and_frauds_committed/,month,Stock Analysis,0.76
1nr7bir,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 13:21:56,It might be time to bet the farm on Constellation Software ($CSU.TO) and Topicus ($TOI.V),"Constellation Software is one of those ""if you know, you know"" companies. For those unaware, the founder and CEO Mark Leonard just stepped down as president of the company for health concerns. He will still remain director of the board, and current COO Mark Miller will assume the President role. 

This guy belongs in the same conversation as Warren Buffett for the capital allocation GOAT. Since the 2006 IPO, Constellation has returned ~35% per year, making it around a 200 bagger in 20 years. This didn't come from a single home run product like Google or Facebook, it was just 20 years of masterful capital deployment by acquiring vertical market software businesses.

I don't want to list out every financial performance metric here, but do yourself a favor and look up a 10 year chart for revenue and free cash flow per share. They keep the share count exactly the same, they don't have high debt levels, and they deploy nearly all of their free cash flow into new acquisitions. The performance is simply staggering, given the size. 

Well, after the news of Mark Leonard stepping down, shares of $CSU.TO are cratering. This is really surprising to me, as Leonard has made it a point to insist that the system that management has built doesn't rely on any single key figure, but more on a culture of excellence spread through a series of decentralized operating groups. Either way, I think the market is offering us a great discount on one of the best businesses in the world. 

Topicus ($TOI.V) is a spin off of one of the aforementioned operating groups, employing the same strategy as Constellation Software, but with faster growing companies based in Europe. Leonard is still on the board, and the Constellation DNA is very evident. They have deployed massive amounts of capital over the past year, and they are operating in a geography with much less competetive capital markets, resulting in comparatively attractive prices.

Both of these companies are now trading at EV/FCF ratios in the low to mid twenties. This is extremely reasonable, arguably cheap, for businesses of this level of quality.

A lot of you were suggesting stocks like GOOG, UNH and ADBE, but those are not the stocks I am looking for. Those might not be stable enough during a recession.

There were some good suggestions like PEP, CNI, and CL.

NEE would also look interesting if it dipped a bit more.

UNH: Owns an extensive healthcare infrastructure with powerful network effects. Vertically integrated with a PBM arm which together with another 2 PBMs, controls 80% of the drug market in USA. NVO in its annual report complained that PBMs are demanding higher rebates due to their dominance. 

NVO: Market leader of diabetes and obesity drugs. Dominates this market alongside Eli Lily.

Comparison: 

Revenue growth: NVO’s market grows at a rapid rate compared to UNH

Moat: UNH network effects beat NVO’s patent protection

Revenue profile: UNH highly diversified, NVO highly reliant on a handful of patents

Competitive strength: UNH best in class, NVO tussling with rival Eli Lily

Regulatory risk: NVO faces stable regulations and stricter regulations against generics 
benefits NVO. UNH faces possible regulatory risks from PBMs and health insurance subjecting to stricter regulations, potentially affecting its margins. 

Financial stability: UNH thin margins can be destroyed if healthcare costs rises faster than it can handle, NVO enjoy fat margins as long as its patent lasts. 

Long term certainty: UNH depends on regulatory capture to avoid stricter regulations and cost of healthcare vs affordability of Americans to maintain margins, but healthcare spending will likely keep rising long term. NVO depends on its drug pipeline which has greater uncertainty. 

Valuation: Roughly similar at low double digit PE

Dividends: Roughly similar at around 3%

Just to note this isnt a growth play at all. They've been trying to figure that out. Thats a potential catalyst for even more room to run. 

The point is RFK jr allows us to see a rare dip in the ticker. Even though it rebounded from 17 to 18.60 quickly theres alot of things to still like alot.

1nsfi0z,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 00:44:16,Why CSU (Constellation Software) is not a buy.,"Hey all,

I am aware of the buzz around the significant drop in CSU's stock price following the management transition from Mark Leonard to Mark Miller. While I find the market's overreaction silly, it is nothing unexpected, i am assuming the same will happen when Buffett steps down as well.

I believe the drop has been around 12 - 17% following the news. That is not a great margin of safety for a rational value investor. Also, looking at the FCF PE is still inflated, to say the least. Moreover, the actual P/E ratio is useless because they throw away so much more cash than they earn. Hence, the cash flow statement is crucial for such asset-heavy companies.

Overall i being someone who has read years of leanoards letters to shareholders, is sad to see him go, and i am sure managament that will assume roles will do fine, i do not think there is a serious margin of safety to buy, because price is a crucial factor, the underlying business is fine, but is not great, and considerng the heavy reliance on management's ability to allocate capital, unless the margin of safety is between 30 - 40%, i just cannot justify a buy.

Thanks.

Just wanted to add when I was referring to the margin of safety i meant the intrinsic value based of future earning powers while i belive most people are buying because of the 20 percent drop following the news.

1nazxs7,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 13:55:07,anyone else feel like we've lost the art of actual business analysis? (rant about modern investing tools),"been reading through some of buffett's early partnership letters and it's wild how much actual business understanding went into his picks back then. dude was literally visiting companies, talking to competitors, understanding entire supply chains. same with peter lynch - he'd walk around malls and notice which stores were busy, then dig deep into the actual business fundamentals.

nowadays it feels like everyone just looks at P/E ratios and calls it value investing. or worse, relies on algorithms and screeners that spit out ""cheap"" stocks without any context about why they're cheap.

i've been trying to get back to that kind of fundamental analysis - really understanding competitive moats, management quality, industry dynamics. but man, the tools available kinda suck for this. yahoo finance gives you numbers but no context. morningstar has some decent analysis but most of it's paywalled. seeking alpha is hit or miss and expensive.

feels like there's this huge gap between ""here's some financial ratios"" and actually understanding whether a business is high quality or not. like, when graham was writing security analysis, he emphasized understanding the actual business operations, not just the math.

what's helped me lately is switching from metric-based screening to theme-based research. instead of filtering for low P/E, i'll start with questions like ""what businesses benefit from aging demographics"" or [""which companies have genuine pricing power""](https://beyondspx.com/?q=which%20companies%20have%20genuine%20pricing%20power&date=2025-09-07) and then find examples. beyondspx has been useful for this approach - they have free research on 5,000+ stocks where you can search by investment themes and get actual explanations of competitive advantages. feels more like the old school method of understanding what you're buying rather than just running screens.

anyone else trying to get back to this kind of deeper business analysis? curious what approaches or tools others have found helpful for understanding the qualitative side of investing.",55,67,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nazxs7/anyone_else_feel_like_weve_lost_the_art_of_actual/,month,Discussion,0.97

To invest now in this firm it is a very risky bet on a company which is not cheap enough yet not growing enough or at all I would say.

1nkii8i,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 15:54:25,I just bought 100 shares in DUOL,"A month ago I wrote a post in this subreddit entitled [I just bought 1000 shares in INTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/UjOsd1RTrg), with an entry price under $20.

I was called a few choice names, none of which I take personally.

My favorites were: 
""may God have mercy on your soul"" and ""OK grandma"" LOL

Now that the FED has finally lowered rates, I've been looking for an AI hyperscaler that can actually deliver.

#Financials

The first thing to catch my eye about DUOL was the quarterly revenue and gross profit curves. Can we all agree that they are a thing of beauty? 

This company now delivers operating margins of 13.5% and an ROE of 19.15%. Again, extremely impressive for a company that's only been profitable for 6 quarters. Their minimal debt shows disciplined execution.

But I don't think we're finished. I think DUOL has the AI-ready platform to scale to a ROE of 60%+ ...we could be talking about the next magnificent company here, a true compounder.

#The Courses

The next thing was to test the app. I had used it about 2 years previously, but now the improvements are enormous. 

They've obviously really thought about the course material, redoing it where necessary. I feel like they have some top PHDs designing the syllabus.

For example, it used to start with sentences like ""the dog drinks water""...

Now it starts with ""I want a coffee"" - literally the first thing you need to say in a new country. Sentence bridges like ""also"" and ""actually"" are introduced early as well, giving flow to sentences, building confidence.

The repetition is now broken up with AI voice calls, language games and podcasts, all hosted by their viral characters.

Recently they announced they would be expanding many more courses from A2 to B2 language proficiency level - even providing language proficiency certificates for employers.

I spoke to my 12 year old foreign nephew for the first time in English the other day. I asked him where he learned English? expecting him to say it was from school - NOPE, it was Duolingo - apparently it's simply fun...

#Unlimited Scalability

DUOL is right to focus on languages right now, but the courses they could add are endless. Here's just a few ideas:

- Sign language
- Personal finance (badly needed imho)
- Home/car maintenance
- Philosophy
- Business administration 
- Geography
- History 

They have already added Chess, Mathematics and Music - Where does it end?!

#AI Hyperscaler

Even without AI, this company is a gem, but with artificial intelligence it's a true beast. They can use AI for:

- Reducing human workload in writing repetitive course material (still human reviewed).
- Creating exciting upsells such as the ""Talk with Lily"" voice call feature.
- Initial drafting of illustrations (this feeds into their viral marketing).
- Directing customer service requests to the right human (my help ticket was responded to in under 2 hours!).

The idea of ChatGPT integrations competing with them is laughable. This isn't as easy to replicate at scale as it looks. They already have the user base momentum...

Actually, the fact most of us still use ChatGPT and Midjourney instead of Gemini, should tell us something about the significance of first-mover advantages in AI.

#Valuation

Now let’s address the high valuation. 

I'm not one of those morons that is going to tell you PE ratios don't matter - earnings absolutely do, and always will matter.

Normally as a value investor I wouldn't buy a company with such a high forward PE.

However, what I look at more is the TRAJECTORY of capital efficiency and operating margins - which in this case (given the clear AI runway) more than justifies the price.

This company is somewhat newly profitable. Some distortion of valuations are to be expected. Earnings in November are likely to continue showing improvement in capital efficiency.

This company is about to start really standing out in stock screeners...",58,78,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkii8i/i_just_bought_100_shares_in_duol/,month,Stock Analysis,0.72

1nkz7ha,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 05:46:57,"Malibu Life Holdings (LON:MLHL) Trading at Huge Discount. Price $20, Book $33+.","Malibu Life Holdings (LON:MLHL) used to be that Third Point Investors Limited was just one of those London-listed closed end funds that gave you exposure to Dan Loeb’s hedge fund strategy via a feeder structure. It traded at a persistent discount to its net asset value, leaving a lot of investors frustrated. Recently, it pivoted with a reverse takeover and transformed itself into an operating reinsurer focused on US fixed annuities. That’s the change. The upcoming opportunity lies in how that restructured business can begin to deliver growth, profits, and get re-rated by the market.

As of now, the volume of shares traded have taken a nosedive since the reverse take over given the reassessment taking place by all institution investors. Furthermore, the company has yet to release it's first quarterly and annual reports since the merger, however, based on the financials reported during the reverse takeover, we can work somethings out. In addition to this, liquidity has also been impacted by the scheduled redemption of 4.38 million shares on 19 September 2025, with initial cash consideration paid that day. After the redemption the free float drops to roughly 17 million shares, which has further thinned day-to-day volumes and made price discovery more volatile. The redemption also took place at a slight discount, meaning the NAV per share should slightly tick up, but we can ignore that bit for now.

The latest numbers tell us that the reference NAV per ordinary share is about \~$33 as of the last disclosure date. The company’s share price is currently trading near $20-21 depending on market moves. The tangible book value of Malibu Life Reinsurance (the acquired business) is roughly US$65-68 million. However, since this was an NAV-to-NAV deal, this won't impact the PB per share.

Putting those together, the implied book value (NAV) per share is $33, while the market is paying around $20. That means the shares are trading at about a 40-45% discount to book value (or NAV). That is a large margin of safety if the book value is sound, and if the reinsurance business can begin to show results.

Risks remain. Execution risk is high: building up premium volume, managing reserves, ensuring profitability in the reinsurance of US fixed annuities is not trivial. Regulatory risk exists if oversight or capital requirements change. There is also the possibility the discount persists or widens if the market is skeptical of management, of the reinsurance strategy, or if early operating results are weak. Liquidity and investor sentiment matter.

Assuming the business executes reasonably well, sells enough treaties or annuity blocks, and begins to deliver mid-teens returns on equity (the stated target), one can model a re-rating of the share price over a 1-2 year horizon. If today’s NAV is \~$33 and the market is paying \~$20, the discount will need to narrow substantially for the share price to catch up. If discount narrows to, say, 10-15%, that alone gives \~25-30% upside (to \~$28-30). Add in NAV growth from earnings (assuming 10-15% ROE, growth in premium base, operational leverage) and you might see NAV rise to perhaps \~$36-40 in 12-24 months. Combined with discount compression that gives a potential price target in the ballpark of US$32-$40 per share.

Given that, a fair one-to-two year price target I would propose is US$35 per share under base case, US$40 per share if execution is strong and re-rating occurs.",51,3,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkz7ha/malibu_life_holdings_lonmlhl_trading_at_huge/,month,Stock Analysis,0.97
1nidkgx,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 06:18:41,Realizing that time is the best investment,"I was running some numbers the other day to see how much I’d have in 10 years if I keep investing steadily. What really hit me is that it’s not about short-term gains—time itself is the biggest factor.

The real compounding doesn’t kick in until 20+ years down the road. That makes me a bit sad, because I’m 40 now, and my plan was always to start living off investments in my 50s until retirement at 65. But seeing the math, it feels like I may have started too late to really enjoy the full snowball effect.

Part of this comes from where I’m from (Europe). Here, investing isn’t really talked about. You pay into social security, and the government pays your pension based on your salary once you hit retirement age. So there’s no real culture of investing early, and I only started very late.

Has anyone else here been in the same boat—starting late and trying to catch up? How did you approach it?

1nuonf9,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 16:42:21,Constellation Software - The King is Gone,"The market is panicking about Constellation Software after its founder, Mark Leonard, resigned. The stock is down nearly 30% from its highs, caused by fears over AI and a scary looking Q2 earnings report. I believe this is a massive overreaction and a great opportunity for long-term investors.

The biggest reason for the panic is that Mark Leonard left. He's seen as the Warren Buffett of Canada. People think the magic is gone with him. It doesn't help that AI is coming for them either. The fear is that generative AI will make their huge portfolio of niche software obsolete. The Q2 earnings also looked terrible. Net income dropped by a shocking 68%.

These fears are all very real. The thing is the company is simply a machine. Leonard built a decentralised system designed to run without him. It's not reliant on one person. His replacement is a 30-year company insider, ensuring continuity. They aren't ignoring AI either. Management held a rare call to address concerns and explained that hundreds of their business units are already integrating AI to improve products and efficiency.  
  
The Q2 earnings also weren't actually bad. That 68% drop in net income I talked about was due to non-cash accounting quirks (a massive foreign exchange loss and a charge related to the rising value of their successful Topicus spin-off). The important number, free cash flow, was actually UP 20%. The business is still printing money.

The recent sell-off is driven by fear, not fundamentals. The panic has created a chance to buy a world-class compounder at a discounted price. The valuation is now much more reasonable, trading at around 23x P/FCF. To me, this is a compelling long-term opportunity.

Curious to hear how others see it, because the market seems to be pricing this company like it’s permanently impaired.

The stock fell nearly 30% after earnings. The hit was mainly about weak Q3 guidance (maintenance outage + low utilization) and an EPS miss, not because of structural decline. To me, this looks more like a cyclical trough than a broken business.

Balance sheet is clean. They’ve got only $275M of notes due 2028 at 4.75%, with no refi wall until then, and more than $500M in liquidity between cash and credit lines. That gives them time to ride through the cycle.

Valuation looks extreme. CLW now trades at \~0.44× tangible book (the lowest since the Great Recession) and \~0.25× sales. Through the cycle, this business should generate around $100M+ in free cash flow (roughly half of EBITDA converts). At today’s market cap, that’s about 3× normalized FCF. They’ve also authorized $100M in buybacks, which is almost one-third of the current market cap.

There’s also some deep value funds here. Towle & Co. and Southeastern Asset Management both bought in earlier this year around $26–27/share, and today the stock trades closer to $21.

SBS paperboard demand hasn’t collapsed. The issue is temporary oversupply and scheduled outages. The market is treating it as if demand is structurally impaired, and I think that’s flat-out wrong.

I wrote up my full research here for anyone interested:

[https://alessandrovittoria.substack.com/p/buying-assets-for-40-on-the-dollar](https://alessandrovittoria.substack.com/p/buying-assets-for-40-on-the-dollar)

My simple thesis: CLW is a cyclical business trading as if it’s permanently broken. The balance sheet gives it all the time it needs, and when utilization recovers, cash flow and buybacks will rerate the stock dramatically.

Of course, risks exist. It’s a cyclical industry, demand could stay weaker for longer, and capital allocation execution always matters. But at this valuation, I think the margin of safety is substantial.

What do you think? Am I missing something here?

1nfjk3c,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 20:28:09,September Stocks,"The following are all undervalued by 40% or more and have been my biggest adds of the month so far:

GLOB - Digital transformation is booming in the IT market, as is Globant’s market share. DD shows this currently trading at around 50% of its fair value. It’s been a ROUGH year so far, but I believe it’s a decent “blood in the streets” slow buy opportunity, providing the floor isn’t too far down. 

BBWI - I don’t want to like this stock. I really don’t, but the intrinsic value is there and with a P/E under 9 and a decent dividend, it seems like low hanging fruit. Things could get worse before they get better, but the value is there. 

LAR - My favorite lithium stock at the moment. I’ve been building since $1.75 and believe the FV ceiling could be in the $6-8 range. The uncertainty is high - Argentina always has political/royalty risk, but they have a narrow moat cost advantage and plenty of other variables to like. 

Rate Cut Mentions:

O & COLD - both undervalued real estate stocks that should benefit from future rate cuts, as the whole sector should. Decent dividends on both too. 

Dark Horses:

MRNA & PFE - RFK’s insanity has decimated a lot of pharma stocks, and I believe it’s a classic “blood in the streets” opportunity. CNC, CRSP, RLAY, BAX RVTY - these are all solid companies and their stocks are significantly undervalued. The political pendulum will ultimately swing back, and I believe patience will pay off when it does. 

RDZN - I love this little car insurance stock. It’s still quite speculative, but the growth potential is solid and I always DCA when it drops below a buck.

And that is what they have been doing for decades... So from this perspective, paying 40 times earnings is justified if you think they will continue to do this for a very long period of time. It only takes 4 years to double earnings at a 20% compounded growth, and some have grown faster than that. Except for Tesla, which is massively overvalued, and Apple which hasn't grown much at all in the past 5 years and is still valued at 37 times earnings. But there must be a point of diminishing returns, or a point of saturation when you reach the TAM... Now AI is the next big thing, and Amazon is spending 2x as much in Capex than 4 years ago. Global GDP is $114T. Nvidia is valued at $4.3T. At this rate, we will see stocks valued at $10T, $20T, $50T...

- Currently paying out a dividend higher than any HYSA.

1ndwgov,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 21:47:26,Thoughts on my doomsday strategy,"With what happened with Oracle today, I am convinced we are in the bubble reminiscent of the dot com bubble. But I’m also confident that timing a pop is likely to result in losses (markets can stay irrational and all).

I’m also thinking that rampant inflation, high liquidity and high interest rates mean that a pop will likely be asset agnostic ie whatever you hold will bleed. But also this same environment means holding cash is lose lose because not only do you miss the ride up, you have inflation eating away. 

So my strategy. Keep my regular interval index investing and keep riding the bull. As bubble occurs, use my assets as leverage to buy even more on the way down (at 10,20,30% drop lines). keeping debt limited to 25% of current asset value meaning I can probably sustain a 50% drop without margin calls. Now if I can hold my income in the turmoil, my regular interval investing should add to the DCA. when market recovers (even in years) I do pretty well. Esp as margin becomes cheaper with recessionary pressure on interest rates.

Now I understand this can quickly turn into a falling knife or Japanese stagnation. but here my hypothesis is that as long as USD is the reserve currency and US the super power that can dictate geopolitics, the US will be the safe(r) mid term horizon investment (10/20 years). Any change to that will happen slowly as other empires fell (sterling silver anyone?)

To me it’s simple which makes it good. Thoughts?

Tl:Dr instead of timing a bubble, I use assets to buy more on margin on the ride down to get cheaper and cheaper assets. ",47,71,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ndwgov/thoughts_on_my_doomsday_strategy/,month,Question / Help,0.75

1nom5ay,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 12:30:44,JP Morgan buy thesis on ASML,"From JP Morgan: ""TSMC has started to ramp up its 2nm process and this process ramp will continue in ’26 when their lead customer, Apple, is likely to start using this process. There have also been press reports yesterday that Nvidia is expected to be the first to adopt the upcoming A16 process at TMSC which will implement backside power. If these reports are true, then TSMC would need to ramp up significant capacity for A16 in ’27 (when it is likely to be in production). A16 will need 1 or 2 more EUV exposures than 2nm and thus will be particularly positive for ASML because of the increase in lithography intensity but more importantly because of the volume of wafer capacity that would need to be added if Nvidia were to start using the leading edge process (Nvidia has been using a process that is 1 or 2 generations behind the leading edge on its leading edge processors till now). TSMC would need to start preparing for Nvidia ramp in terms of orders and building capacity in 2H26 which would result in stronger orders/sales for ASML from TSMC in both ’26 but definitely in ’27.

HBM-related demand remains robust and memory pricing has not shown weakness. Indications have been that Samsung is possibly closer to qualification for HBM4 at Nvidia as well, which would be very positive for equipment shipments starting end of ’26 into ’27. Thus, risks that ASML guides to a weak ’26 are becoming much less likely in our opinion and ’27 trends will be strong (though not guided so soon by ASML). Importantly for the stock, once ASML guides to ’26 revenue range on October 15th, only ’27 will matter and though ASML will not guide to it, the market will speculate on positive trends and that should help the stock. ASML also continues to trade below prior average multiple of 30-35x and thus appears attractive. We reiterate that ASML remains our top pick in ‘25.""

Positive sell side reports have been a major catalyst for ASML over the last month. Coverage of ASML had become widely negative throughout '25. There are two bear theses which are related. The first is that litho intensity has peaked in terms of capex requirements to move to the next nodes. The second thesis is that high-NA won’t be adopted for a while as it is not economic. 

While TSMC didn’t introduce scaling at the N2 node as they moved to the new GAA transistor architecture (nanosheets), we should see scaling at the next one or even two nodes again—which will be a positive for ASML. On the second bear thesis, the positive is that high-NA is much more economic than EUV at its early introduction, as EUV’s uptime and productivity were extremely low. The technology had all sorts of problems and there were continuously bear theses flying around that the technology will never make it. The positive for ASML though is that even if high-NA gets delayed, more multiple patterning with EUV tools will be needed at the most advanced processing steps, which actually increases revenues and margins for ASML (high-NA is lower margin than EUV due to current low capacity levels).

So, the long term bull case for ASML is that:  

1. TSMC at its next one or two nodes will start scaling again, leading to increased EUV demand as more EUV process steps will be needed again.  

2. TSMC is building out three fab clusters—one in the US and two in Taiwan, where capacity requirements are increasing due to the boom in AI demand.  

3. DRAM is becoming more EUV intensive, due to the scaling roadmap.  AI is very DRAM intensive (HBM), boosting needed fab capacity.  

4. ASML has zero competition.

I'd add some charts here with further details but apparently Reddit doesn't allow this - anyways, more background on the current outlook in AI can be found here, which is an important driver for future  ASML tool orders:

CRM (what does it do)

Salesforce is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform that helps businesses manage and improve interactions with their customers. It centralizes customer data, allowing sales teams to track leads, opportunities, and accounts while automating repetitive tasks and providing insights through analytics and dashboards. Salesforce also supports marketing automation, audience segmentation, and engagement tracking, and offers customer service tools to manage support tickets, chats, and calls efficiently. Additionally, it provides a platform for building custom apps, integrates collaboration tools like Slack, and delivers advanced reporting and data visualization through products like Tableau. Overall, Salesforce helps businesses sell more effectively, market smarter, provide better customer service, and make data-driven decisions all in one unified cloud platform.

Financials 

Annual Revenue(for fiscal year 25)
$37.9 billion, up 8.7% yoy.  ￼
Net Income $6.2 billion, a 49.8% increase from the previous year.  ￼
Operating Income: $7.66 billion.  ￼
Operating Cash Flow: $13.1 billion, up 28% yoy

Market sentiment 

To me it looks like the market re rated Salesforce due to its slowing revenue growth, but Marc Benioff has been saying AI will help scale agent force for a while now and we just haven’t seen it in the numbers.


Adobe (what does it do) 

Adobe is a software company that provides tools and services for creativity, digital documents, and customer experiences. Its creative software, like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and InDesign, is mainly used for image editing, graphic design, video production, and publishing. Adobe also offers document solutions such as Acrobat and Adobe Sign for creating, editing, and securely sharing PDFs and other digital files. Additionally, through its Experience Cloud, Adobe helps businesses manage marketing campaigns, analyze customer data, and personalize digital interactions. Most of its products are offered via subscription through Creative Cloud, giving users access to apps, cloud storage, and collaboration tools.

Financials 

Total Revenue: $23.65 billion to $23.70 billion.  ￼
Non-GAAP EPS: $20.80 to $20.85.  ￼
Digital Media ARR Growth: Targeting 11.3% yoy
income for the fiscal year 2025 is projected to be between $9.48 billion and $9.53 billion

Market Sentiment

I’ve noticed that the fundamentals for Adobe keep improving while the stock price decreases. There’s fears that ai will hurt the business, but it hasn’t hit their top or bottom line yet. I don’t see why Adobe trades at a discount right now. 

Final thoughts: 

Both are buys in my opinion, I haven’t started a position because I need to do further research, but from what I’m seeing Salesforce has about 35% upside to their intrinsic value, and for Adobe I see 30% upside to their intrinsic value.

1ndmz2z,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 14:54:47,Lululemon (LULU) - Stretched Too Thin?,"Lululemon's stock has been absolutely hammered this year, down over 50% after a disastrous earnings report that shattered its growth story. The big question is whether this is a massive overreaction and a buying opportunity, or if the company is fundamentally broken.

The bear case is that the US Market is imploding. Their biggest market has hit a wall. Sales are flat, and comparable sales are actually down 4%. The CEO himself admitted their product line has become ""stale"".

Competition is also eating their lunch. The ""athleisure"" market LULU created is now saturated. Newer, faster brands like Alo Yoga and Vuori are outmanoeuvring them on fashion and trends.

Finally, a sudden change in US trade policy has hit them with a crippling tariff bill, set to wipe out around $240 million from their gross profit this year alone. This is crushing their margins at the worst possible time.

The bull case however, says that while the US stagnates, their international business is on fire, with revenue up 22%. Bulls are betting this can save the company.

Management has announced an aggressive plan to refresh over a third of their products,  and have hired a new Chief AI Officer to speed up innovation.

After the crash, the valuation has fallen from its historically high levels. On paper, it's trading more like a boring old retailer than a premium growth brand.

My Verdict:
Despite the tempting valuation, I argue that Lululemon is not a buy right now. The problems in its core US market are structural, not temporary. The tariff hit is massive and unavoidable, and their turnaround plan is a risky gamble that could take a long time to pay off, if it even works. This is a classic falling knife.

According to Vicki Hollub (CEO) Oxy will start buying back shares and increasing its dividend once its debt load is below $15bn. Now its debt is around $24bn, so if they sell for $10bn and use all of it to pay down debt, I think shareholder return are going to increase substantially even at current oil prices.

As a shareholder of OXY I would like to see the sale coming through, especially at $10bn. The only thing I don’t quite understand is that Vicki Hollub repeatedly said that its CCS/U project uses large amounts of Chemicals (mainly KOH) for which oxychem is the largest or second largest producer in the US and this way they have many synergies. I bought oxy for their reserves and their relatively low break even in the Permian and I don’t really think that their carbon capture business will take off, but I don’t like that the CEO is inconsistent there.

1nkepvr,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 13:31:46,Starbucks (SBUX) - Is the company in a death spiral or is this a huge turnaround opportunity?,"**TLDR:**

Starbucks is facing its most profound crisis since 2008. The numbers are grim: global sales are falling, customer traffic is plummeting, and profit margins are collapsing.

In China, what was once their biggest growth engine has become a strategic disaster. They've been completely outmanoeuvred by a local, tech-savvy competitor (Luckin Coffee) and their market share has collapsed. They're now reportedly looking to sell a stake in the China business at a steep discount.

Back in the US, the company is locked in a bitter and expensive war with its own workforce, as hundreds of stores have unionised and the company faces charges of illegal union-busting.

The market is pinning all its hopes on the new CEO, Brian Niccol, the guy credited with turning around Chipotle. He has a comprehensive ""Back to Starbucks"" plan to fix the in-store experience, improve efficiency, and innovate the menu.

The problem? The stock is still trading at an insane valuation (P/E over 36), pricing in a perfect, flawless execution of this turnaround. This seems insane given the massive headwinds. Is the faith in one man justified, or is the market ignoring a business whose fundamentals are cracking?

I wrote a full, in-depth analysis breaking down the numbers, the China debacle, the union fight, and whether Niccol's plan has a realistic chance of success against such a risky backdrop.

Google and PayPal dropped news about a multi-year deal where PayPal becomes a key payment processor for Google Cloud, Google Play, etc. Stock only gained 3% after hours which seems modest for what sounds like a significant partnership.

PayPal gets integrated across Google's ecosystem and Google's AI gets incorporated into PayPal's security services. This seems more substantial than their usual announcements since it involves Google Cloud enterprise payments, not just consumer-facing features.

What's interesting for me is that PayPal has been pushing into advertising lately, and Google obviously dominates that space. Could this partnership open doors for shared advertising data? Both companies could benefit from combining Google's search/ad targeting with PayPal's transaction data. That would be a pretty powerful combination for advertisers.

Been considering picking up some PayPal shares. Does this partnership signal the bottom of the stock and maybe the catalyst PYPL needs to break out of its current trading range, or is that 3% aftermarket bump all we're likely to see?

1nidut6,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 06:35:39,No more quarterly reports," Reuters just came out with a article stating that Donald Trump wants the SEC to relax rules on  US Companies to have to give quarterly reports and wants them to be on par with UK and European companies to give reports every six months. 

I absolutely hate this idea and it gives companies an extra 3 months to fudge the accounting numbers. 

This absolutely provides less transparency in the companies for retail investors. The SEC supposed to protect the investors not cover up for the companies. 

The manipulation is down right criminal.  

This will also make it more difficult for the IRS to go after  corporate tax fraud and for the government to prosecute corporate money laundering crimes. 

What ever side you are on politically you have to admit this only benefits companies and not the investors.  

It's almost like there is a willingness to try to prevent the down fall of the economy so bad that the companies have to delay earnings reports on a permanent basis up to six months. 

Please someone make sense of this . I'm not looking for a political answer.  I just want someone to tell me I'm not wrong when saying this and I want a answer that makes sound economical sense that is best for all people involved in the economy.

There is currently no commercially viable use for quantum computers. 

IONQ revenue growth is obfuscated through acquisitions - they do not separate out revenue by segment, hence no way to tell what’s organic and inorganic. 

Current contracts are for research purposes - again there is no current viable path to profits using quantum computers. 

The largest issue with quantum computers is the error rate. With a ~0.1% error rate per operation, as operations scale the results therefore become useless.

The stock is up 800% in the last year. This parabolic move without commensurate fundamental economic shift is synonymous with a bubble.

1no64zm,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 22:48:39,The SMR Nuclear Renaissance seems to be a pipe dream being build on sand,"To get this out of the way, I am not anti-nuclear. I am however, struggling to understand how the economics make sense. I see a lot of posts and comments suggesting it is the only clean energy source that can provide growing baseload power, but the conversation rarely delves deeper than that. 

From what I've seen, the economic and logistical case for Small Modular Reactors seems to completely erode when looking at market data, historical project performance, and even fundamental physics. It looks to me like SMRs are not a viable solution for modern energy needs, as they seem economically uncompetitive, appear to be mirroring the nuclear industry's record of project failure, and could even exacerbate the unresolved problem of radioactive waste.

&nbsp;

**1: Costs:**

Data from Lazard's Levelized Cost of Energy analysis shows that unsubsidized utility-scale solar and onshore wind are the cheapest forms of new generation. 

- **Onshore wind** can have a levelized cost of energy as low as $27 per megawatt-hour, with a midpoint of $50.
- **Utility-scale solar** is similar, as low as $29 per megawatt-hour with a midpoint of $60. 
- **Gas combined** cycle plant has a midpoint cost of $77 per megawatt-hour. 

The only recent U.S. data point for new nuclear, Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4, has a realized cost of approximately $190 per megawatt-hour. So finances from out our most recent reactor build shows costs that are more than three times more expensive than new solar and wind. It doesn't seem like SMRs will be cheaper. The Department of Energy itself modeled a median cost per megawatt that was over 50% higher for SMRs than for large reactors

Even when you account for grid stability using a Levelized Full System Cost of Electricity model, the system cost for renewables in Texas is around $97 per megawatt-hour, which is nearly identical to nuclear at $96. This model assumes only 5% firm backup power, but the U.S. grid already has about 25% firm capacity from existing nuclear and hydropower, which makes this a pessimistic scenario for renewables. It seems likely that wind and solar are far cheaper than nuclear even when using this full system cost model.

&nbsp;

**2: Poor Track Record:**

 On top of this, the nuclear industry has a consistent, international record of severe budget and schedule overruns, which makes it hard to believe claims that SMRs will be delivered on time and on budget. 

For example, Plant Vogtle in the U.S. was originally estimated at $14 billion for completion in 2016 or 2017, but it was finally finished in 2023-2024 at a cost of around $35 billion. That's a 150% cost overrun and a seven-year delay. Ratepayers in Georgia will pay an extra $7.6 billion for it. Also, after completion, Vogtle Unit 3 was offline for 9.5 of its first 48 weeks. 

It's not just a U.S. problem either. The Flamanville-3 reactor in France began in 2007 with a €3.3 billion budget and a 2012 completion date, but it was finished in 2024 with a final cost of €13.2 billion - a 300% overrun and a twelve-year delay. An official audit even places the total cost at €19.1 billion. This pattern seems to be holding for existing SMRs. 

The world's only three operating SMRs, two in Russia and one in China, had cost overruns of 300% to 400%. An SMR in Argentina has a 700% cost overrun. China's first SMR took 12 years to build instead of the planned 4, and its second one is projected to cost twice as much per megawatt as a large reactor.

The flagship SMR project in the U.S., NuScale's Carbon Free Power Project, failed before construction even began because of unsustainable costs. It was terminated in November 2023 because its power was just too expensive for utilities to buy. The construction cost estimate for the 462 MW plant increased by 75%, from $5.3 billion in 2021 to $9.3 billion in 2023. 

The capital cost per kilowatt rose to over $20,000, which is comparable to the much larger Plant Vogtle. The target price for NuScale's electricity surged by 53%, from $58 per megawatt-hour to an unmarketable $89, and that was even with a $1.4 billion subsidy from the Department of Energy. 

Projections for other SMR designs look even worse. JP Morgan estimates some Western SMRs may cost $15 to $20 million per megawatt. Bill Gates estimated his 375 MW Natrium reactor would cost close to $10 billion, which is nearly $30 million per megawatt - double the per-megawatt cost of Vogtle.

&nbsp;

**3: Waste and Liabilities** 

Contrary to some of the marketing claims, it seems SMRs will actually produce significantly more radioactive waste per unit of energy than large reactors. A 2022 Stanford University study found that due to greater neutron leakage in small cores, SMRs will magnify the existing nuclear waste problem. The study suggests SMR designs will increase the total volume of nuclear waste requiring disposal by a factor of 2 to 30. They would also generate at least nine times more neutron-activated steel than conventional plants per unit of energy. On top of that, after 10,000 years, the radiotoxicity of the spent fuel from the SMRs studied would be at least 50% higher per unit of energy compared to conventional fuel.

This new, more complex waste would be added to a global stockpile of 400,000 metric tons of spent fuel, which is growing by over 11,000 tons annually, for which no country has a permanent disposal solution. The U.S. alone has over 88,500 metric tons of spent fuel stored at 75 sites across 33 states, and that number grows by 2,000 tons per year. There are other liabilities and risks to consider as well. Nuclear plants consume a lot of water, somewhere between 500 and 800 gallons per megawatt-hour. In contrast, solar PV uses only 2 to 20 gallons for cleaning, and wind turbines use virtually none. 

There are also massive unfunded cleanup costs. The global unfunded liability for decommissioning energy assets is $7.5 trillion. In the U.S., the failure to create a permanent waste repository has already cost taxpayers $5.3 billion in reimbursements to utilities for on-site storage, with future liability projected to be between $29 billion and $50 billion. Stranded assets from early plant closures could add another $60 billion in liabilities. The SMR supply chain also seems fragile and dependent on foreign nations. Over 90% of U.S. uranium fuel is imported, and there are no significant domestic suppliers for key materials like Hafnium, Niobium, and Nickel. 

Lastly, when you look at where major data centers are (Northern Virginia, Phoenix, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago), these aren't in the middle of nowhere; they are major urban areas. Do you think there won't be massive NIMBYism and regulatory efforts to halt small nuclear plants in these areas? 

&nbsp;

**4: I Just Dont get it**

When you look at the market, it seems SMRs are a non-competitive technology being outpaced by cheaper, faster, and more scalable solutions. From 2011 to 2021, the world added 56 gigawatts of nuclear capacity. In the single year of 2023, the world added 510 gigawatts of renewable capacity. For 2024, renewables accounted for 92.5% of all new global power capacity, and for 2025, solar, wind, and batteries represent 93% of planned U.S. utility-scale capacity additions. 0% is nuclear.

Nuclear's share of global power generation peaked at 17% in the mid-1990s and fell to 9.1% by 2024. If projections hold, solar will generate more electricity than nuclear by next year. Meanwhile things like advanced geothermal are projected to provide baseload power at a capital cost of $4,500 per kilowatt by 2030, eroding the nuclear is the only scalable renewable baseload argument.

My brief thesis:

* FactSet has a strong moat. The company serves institutional investors: hedge funds, asset management companies, buy-side shops, pension shops, etc... The customers either buy a FactSet terminal, or SaaS subscription.
* The customer retention rate is above 90%.
* Manageable debt.
* Strong track record of earnings growth.
* Trading at PE of 18.5 (reasonable compared to its historical average of above 25.
* Revenue is still growing at a steady pace.
* Risks: Primary risk is that the tool could be replaced by other AI saas products. Which is a fair fear to have, however they are so deeply integrated with customers that it will be hard to rip off FactSet and replace them with a new startup. FactSet has tons of historical data and expertise in financial data market, I would expect the management to innovate to fend off competitors. 
* I would like to call out that FactSet by no means is offering margin of safety like my previous investments in baba, meta, bti, and others. However it is currently trading at a fair value.
* A very general example to understand FactSet: An analyst would pull the data either through api, or dashboard, transform the data with other third party and first party data to create dashboard/reports for management.

50% reduction in share price this year.
PE at 11. Usually at 20.
Analyst ratings broadly positive. 
4.5% dividend

Moats include:
Very strong brand recognition. Up there with McDs or Burger King in the UK. 

It's the most inexpensive option. I dont see weak consumer sentiment as an issue. I've traded down to it recently and it's always been heaving. There's nowhere else for the UK consumer to trade down to, other than complete behaviour change (prepping food at home). And that will be more than mitigated by the middle classes starting to eat there (see Aldi and Lidl) if things continue to worsen. 

All the headwinds around inflation and taxes on employees will also affect the competition and Greggs are well placed to survive this (see balance sheet) and eat up the spare demand when others fold. I also think there's some room for them to increase pricing a bit. £3 bacon roll and coffee could go higher and they would still outcompete the rest on price. Likewise the £5 lunch deal which is about half that of Subway (hardly a premium option!)

But maybe im missing something because they are being heavily shorted by hedge funds. What am I missing?

1nq9ft6,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 11:13:18,Thought on investing in Qualcomm (QCOM) over the long term: 20-40 years,"I’ve begun looking into QCOM these past few months .. was talking with a buddy who knows a good bit about semi-conductors, but not very much about investing. 

My buddy is a big fan of QCOM largely due to their patents and market share - according to him, nearly every single cell phone (Apple, android, and any other brands) use QCOM technology to make their phones, and those who do not use QCOM technology in their cellular devices, still owe a percentage of revenue/royalty to QCOM on sales due to QCOM’s 300,000+ patents surrounding wireless communication.

I love the sound of that, but obviously concerns regarding a monopoly arise in my mind. I’d like to gauge the sentiment of you all - is the fear of QCOM being labeled a monopoly and/or their patents being stripped away a major long-term concern?

QCOM has a solid 2% annual dividend yield, with a reasonable PE ratio of 16.5 - $10.3 billion in revenue last quarter and $2.7 billion in net income should mean they are roughly producing $40 billion in revenue annually, and making more than $10 billion in net income (25% + profit margins). 

I’ll obviously continue to look further into QCOM before making an investment, but like I said, want to hear the sentiment of you all. A company I would like to build an initial position in, turn on dividend reinvestments, and periodically add to the position over the next decade or two.

Nvda and googl together make up 84% of my portfolio. 

I was thinking to rotate into:
1. KSPI - fintech company with crazy ROE and operating margin that grows revenhe 15-20% a year, pays a huge dividend and also this year acquired business in Turkey and aggressively expanding there. Currently trading at 8 PE, PEG 0.28 

2. CDLR - construction company that focuses on offshore wind turbines. Company has 2.5 Billion euros of backlog contracts signed. Trading at 6.98 PE, PEG 0.07 (how is that even possible?)

3. KAP.IL - largest uranium extractor, with lowest uranium extraction cost. They are going through company restructuring and trading at PE of 11. Pays huge dividend as well. 

4. BN - just because this looks like a very diversified bet in one stock. PE is craz
crazy high but only because of the complex hierarchical structure of the corporation.

It wasn't long ago that Unity was setting fire to its own reputation with the Runtime Fee fiasco. 

Since then, it's been through a brutal ""reset"": 25% of the workforce laid off, the Wētā Digital acquisition (of Avatar fame) discontinued, and a new CEO with a proper gaming background (ex-Zynga and EA) has taken the wheel.

For as long as I can remember, Unity has been a company that just burns cash. But the latest numbers tell a different story. They're now strongly free cash flow positive. The new boss, Matthew Bromberg, is calling this an ""inflection point,"" claiming the painful cuts have revealed a profitable core business underneath all the bloat.

The big hope seems to be pinned on their new AI advertising platform, Vector, which is already giving their monetisation arm a serious boost. The plan is to finally get that ""Create and Grow"" flywheel spinning properly.

The question is, is this a genuine, sustainable turnaround, or just a dead cat bounce driven by aggressive cost-cutting? I've gone deep on their new strategy, the financials, the Bromberg effect, and how they really stack up against Unreal Engine now.

ROE - 67%

**RDW (Redwire):** Space & defense tech – growing government and commercial contracts, recently confirmed they’ve shipped more drones to Ukraine and awarded a NASA contract.

**GDYN (Grid Dynamics):** Digital transformation & AI consulting – recurring enterprise demand, attractive margins vs peers. New visa changes are also a positive for them. Should make a big recovery with IT spend set to increase again.

**UPST (Upstart):** AI driven lending platform – improving credit performance, potential profitability inflection. Lowering interest rate environment very good for them too.

**VLN (Valens Semiconductor):** High speed connectivity chips for autos & industrial – benefits from EV and ADAS adoption. Recent partnership announced with Samsung. 

**GRRR (Gorilla Tech):** Edge AI and security analytics plus AI infrastructure – expanding in IoT and smart infrastructure. Recently announced a $1.4b deal in SE Asia with the potential to expand a further $2.5b amongst other contracts too.

1nvc4nn,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 11:58:03,JD Stock Forecast,"Hey everyone I have had some pretty solid calls this year on foreign equities, including BABA at $114 and JMIA at $2.40. I am back with another call and DD report on JD. 

Chinese equities have been abandoned by global investors, and JD.com is one of the clearest examples. The stock fell from over $100 in 2021 to below $30 in 2023 despite remaining profitable and holding one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector.

Today JD is valued at less than 10x earnings, 0.3x sales, and just above book value. It sits on more than $27 billion in cash and is using buybacks to reduce its float. This is an e-commerce and logistics leader trading at distressed multiples, while peers like Amazon (33x PE) and Alibaba (21x PE) command far higher valuations.

The recovery in 2025 is starting to take shape for China. Alibaba has already surged more than 70 percent this year as sentiment improves. JD has lagged, but volumes are rising, short interest is falling, and the stock recently broke resistance levels (200d SMA). The fundamentals point to double digit revenue growth, expanding profitability, and a long runway in AI, robotics, and fintech.

For my modeling into 2030, I assumed the following:

* **Revenue Growth Assumptions:** Modeled CAGR between 10–20% depending on macro conditions and market share trends.
* **Margin Expansion:** Forecasts net margins improving to 4–5% through cost efficiencies, logistics scaling, and AI-driven operations.
* **Buybacks:** $27B in cash could allow repurchase of 15–20% of shares by 2030, lifting EPS by 20–25%.
* **Peer Multiples:** Valuation targets based on Alibaba (\~21x P/E) and Amazon (30–40x P/E) suggest significant re-rating potential.
* **Scenario Analysis:**
   * Bear: $80 by 2030 (10% CAGR, 15x P/E).
   * Base: $140 by 2030 (15% CAGR, 20x P/E).
   * Bull: $200+ by 2030 (20% CAGR, 25x P/E, upside from AI/health/fintech).
* **Optionality:** Strategic investments in healthcare, fintech, and robotics are not fully priced in, so upside could exceed modeled cases.

This is not financial advice, but the setup resembles other moments of extreme mispricing that I have seen reverse sharply once capital flows return. JD’s logistics moat, authenticity focus, and cash reserves give it staying power in a very competitive market. 

Just because Chinese equities were punished for years, does not mean they always will be. Institutions can only ignore cash flows and valuations such as these for so long, particularly as US markets approach extreme overbought levels. 

For a less fundamental approach, JD historically lags than catches big moves from BABA. I see that happening here, and rather quickly as rally begins to broaden out. ",30,43,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://northwiseproject.com/jd-stock-forecast-2030/,month,Stock Analysis,0.87
1npambc,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 08:20:12,Deep Value with $GAMB,"Recently stumbled upon some posts on here asking why gambling.com stock is so cheap right now.

They are profitable with good margins, growing, got a great CEO who has been with the company for almost 10 years, share buybacks and more - yet the stock chart looks like they are going bankrupt.

I read trough their balance sheets and watched all interviews with the CEO and i cant find a single reason why the market is overreacting like this.
One of their recent aquisitions ""Oddjams"" has a lawsuit against them for scraping odds data from third parties but i feel like its hard to really combat data scraping and pinpoint whats legal and what crosses the line. Even if guilty, it may take years for the lawsuit to resolve.

In the meanwhile GAMB is using their insane cashflow to aquire more and more businesses while growing their marketshare and diversifying income streams.

This feels like a generational buy at these levels - i would argue there is assymetric alpha here.
The fair value of the stock is about 60-70% upside from just ebit and cashflow. Factor in the meme-worthy ticker that will tickle the wallstreetbets fans and a CEO that knows what he is doing (and is rewarded with an options plan if the stock price reaches X for 6 months) and you got a great play in my books.

Personally (and funnily enough) All-In on the stock at these levels.
Market thinks this is an affiliate marketing company but its missed that all the buyouts diversified away from it with a much broader setup for the future. They are quietly buying companies to build out their offers and tech worldwide.

Feel free to give your opinion!

1nekv2l,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 17:15:52,[DD] FNMA & FMCC — What an $800B IPO Could Mean for Today’s Shareholders,"There’s been a lot of noise around Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) as the government talks about a potential IPO at ~$800B valuation. Let’s break down what that would actually mean for current common shareholders.

⸻

Step 1: Treasury Warrants
	•	Treasury holds warrants for 79.9% of the common equity.
	•	If exercised, legacy common keeps just 20.1% of the pie.

⸻

Step 2: Preferred Stock
	•	Senior Preferred Stock (SPS): ~$355B.
	•	Junior Preferred: ~$33B.
	•	If converted, these come out of the equity before common.

⸻

Step 3: Potential IPO Capital Raise
	•	FHFA capital rules suggest a big equity raise is likely (say $100B+), meaning new shares = more dilution.

⸻

Scenarios

1. Warrants Only
	•	Legacy = 20.1% of $800B = $161B.
	•	FNMA: $86B ÷ 1.16B shares ≈ $74/share
	•	FMCC: $75B ÷ 0.65B shares ≈ $115/share

2. Warrants + SPS + Juniors Convert
	•	$800B − $388B = $412B left.
	•	Legacy 20.1% = $83B.
	•	FNMA ≈ $38/share
	•	FMCC ≈ $60/share

3. Warrants + SPS + Juniors + IPO Raise
	•	Add ~$100B dilution from new issuance.
	•	FNMA ≈ $25–40/share
	•	FMCC ≈ $40–50/share

⸻

Takeaway

Even in the worst dilution case, FNMA and FMCC are trading below fair value ($15–14 today vs. $25–50 in a full-dilution $800B IPO).

If Treasury only exercises warrants (and writes down prefs), upside could be enormous ($74–115/share). But if they convert everything, the upside is more modest, though still positive.

The key variable is how Treasury handles the senior preferred stock. That decision alone will determine if these are once-in-a-generation deep value plays or fully priced already.

1nopc6h,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 14:30:34,Beyond NVO and LLY: Expanding Your GLP-1 Portfolio,"I think everyone here knows about Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO), and if you believe the bull case for GLP-1’s I’m just going to assume you see a lot of value in both. Their GLP1 drugs treat one of the most common ailments on earth, and yet they are beaten down while the market is at all time highs. However, I’m not going to be making much of a bull case for GLP1’s here, others have done that. This post is about identifying lesser known companies that stand to benefit from the bull case for GLP1’s coming to fruition, as well as international markets. Here is what you need to know: 

The biggest news I really hope you know as a GLP1 investor is that semaglutide’s patents expire (all of them) next year in Canada, India, Brazil, Turkey, and Mexico. This has been well known for a while so it's not a huge drag on NVO or LLY, but we should all consider what generic GLP1’s hitting the market at the same time as orals next year will do. These two coinciding events could rapidly diminish the spooky novelty and price of these drugs, driving demand and adoption throughout the world. Next year will be pivotal, but this also raises the question, which companies are making the first truly affordable versions of these drugs?

First, this won’t be a market for just any generics maker, only those experienced in manufacturing biosimilar peptides and injectables will have a chance here, so it's not as zero-sum as some simple pressed pill generics market. The first mover will be the Swiss generics maker Sandoz (SDZNY) which plans to have generics on shelves in Canada by January at around $75 dollars a month (\~70% discount to current prices). That is the price of a nice gym membership. The other confirmed entrants in Canada will be Apotex (private), BIOCON.NS, and Dr. Reddy’s (RDY). Expect TEVA pharma and Viatris (VTRS) to enter later.  

I like SDZ quite a bit, price-to-sales of 2.4, forward P/E of 25. It’s up 45% this year but that's not ridiculous in this market. Here is some quick back of the napkin math: 

Current estimate is 2026 total revenue grows from 11B to 11.875B, 3%(300M) increase y/y from 2025 growth. Currently 1M Canadian GLP1 users, 4M total type 2 diabetics. Let’s say SDZ gets 500k of sales at $75 for 10 months of 2026, that is 375M of new revenue from just Canada GLP1’s next year. This is an extremely rough estimate, but I buy the general case of SDZ’s revenue from just GLP1’s next year being underestimated. 

RDY like SDZ is an experienced biosimilars manufacturer and has plans to aggressively enter all markets open to generics, especially its home market India. With a p/e of 18, p/s of 3, basically no debt and \~800M in cash RDY looks like a value play in an expensive market. If these drugs take off in these foreign markets this could be criminally undervalued. Now a bit more on these markets specifically:

Brazil is an underrated market, there are \~70-80M Brazilians who have private health insurance and make up a wealthier cohort who live very much like the average American. A study found this cohort’s life expectancy (83yrs) is actually higher. Of this privately insured cohort, \~14M are obese, and \~6M have type 2 diabetes. This is much larger than the Canadian market, and should be made up of fairly analogous market participants. There are, of course, the other 150M Brazilians as well. Consider [HYPE3.SA](http://HYPE3.SA) as a pure Brazil play, but SDZ, RDY, BIOCON, and TEVA will all be here as well.

Expect BIOCON, RDY, and SUN Pharmaceuticals to dominate an Indian market that while very large (70M-85M type 2 diabetics), will be extremely crowded, and frankly hard to gauge in terms of adoption. I want to buy BIOCON as they are an experienced exporter with a large Canadian presence, but I’ve had no luck doing so because there are no ADRs. 

A final note on generics, TEVA may win in the end at least revenue-wise. They are the generics giant, have the most know-how, and have quietly already got their foot in the door. Just a couple months ago they started making generic liraglutide in the US, an early GLP1 (not very good, so not a huge deal). This won’t impact their bottom line but it builds their GLP1 production capability for free, expect them to enter these markets aggressively, if you like the value here like I do, make it your top generics play.

Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) is a speculative play that I’m sure many of you have probably heard of. They make an oral that just completed phase 2 trials successfully, but the market hated the results due to high expectations. Personally, having read the study, I think it was blown out of proportion and it's valued nicely as a speculative play. I certainly like their drug better than Amgen’s or Metsera/Pfizer’s because it is an oral with genuinely good weight loss results already in phase 3 trials.

Telemedicine is the last obvious place to look here, the pick is LifeMD (LFMD).  NVO and LLY are never going to do business with HIMS again after the compounding issue, and HIMS cannot directly sell semaglutide or tirzepitide at all. LFMD has direct partnerships with both LLY and NVO and directly sells on their platform. Buy this as a fairly pure GLP1 play in telemedicine, and don’t worry too much about them getting sued, that's just a right of passage for telemedicine companies (seriously though). The valuation here is also just flat out good, 1.3 p/s (compared to HIMS’ 6.5) and analysts are rating it with serious upside right now. I may have buried the lede here as LFMD is arguably the purest GLP1 bull case play other than NVO and LLY and it is nice and beaten down, the red flags are the lawsuits and potential regulatory issues with telemedicine. 

A final note: NVO’s EVOKE Phase 3 Alzheimer’s/Dementia study will report results by the end of 2025, maybe any day now. Results will likely be middle of the road, if they are bad, well, we’ll take a hit with losing potential dementia treatment upside. But if results are good the sky might be the limit here, if GLP1’s can significantly treat obesity and Alzheimer’s with an oral pill… well you do the math. Get in or get out before these results drop. 

My GLP1 portfolio is about 35% LLY, 20% NVO, 15% LFMD, 10% TEVA, 10% SDZ, 5% RDY, and 5% VKTX. Good luck all.

1njtlhw,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 20:09:18,Adobe Inc. (ADBE) - Long,"ADBE represents a compelling value around $350. The market is pricing in a collapsing moat from GenAI and new entrants; the financials of a mature, entrenched franchise do not corroborate that story. Adobe should compound free cash flow \~12% for a decade, and today’s setup offers \~32% MOS versus a $519 IV, with buybacks providing a tangible tailwind.

Variant View

Consensus narrative: Adobe’s Creative Cloud is about to be disrupted—by prompt-driven GenAI that renders pro tools obsolete, by Canva’s ease-of-use, and by Figma’s collaborative UI/UX model. Adobe’s failed 2022 bid for Figma at $20B (50x sales) is held up as proof that Adobe knows it’s losing.

My view: the disruption story is not showing up where it must—gross/operating margins, ROIC, FCF, and enterprise retention/expansion. Adobe’s pro workflows remain the standard; switching costs and network effects are durable; and Adobe is incorporating GenAI inside those workflows with a differentiator rivals lack: commercial safety (training corpus + IP indemnification). At a 2020-like price, the stock embeds the fear but not the empirical reality.

Adobe Inc Summary

Adobe runs three segments: Digital Media (Creative Cloud + Document Cloud; \~74% of revenue), Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising. Flagship pro apps (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, After Effects) are deeply embedded in creative pipelines across education and the professional market. Distribution is direct/enterprise plus channels. Founded 1982; HQ San Jose.

The Bear Case (Market Narrative)

GenAI obsolescence: Prompt-based tools can now generate high-quality images/video/vectors from text, compressing the need for pro software.

Canva & Figma erosion: Canva wins with simplicity and templates; Figma with browser-native, real-time collaboration. Adobe’s $20B Figma attempt signals existential fear.

Subscription resentment: Customers hate Creative Cloud pricing and will defect once alternatives are “good enough.”

Rebuttal

Evidence gap: There is no material deterioration in reported economics to validate a crumbling moat. Revenue growth has moderated to \~11% from 15–20% seven to eight years ago, consistent with maturation and scale—not with a loss of pricing power or share in the pro base.

Network effects + switching costs: Creative Cloud remains the industry standard for professional workflows. File types, asset libraries, plugin ecosystems, educational pipelines, and collaboration with agencies/clients create a web of dependencies that reinforce Adobe’s position. Gross margins are incredibly high and operating margins continue to expand, a clean read on stickiness and pricing power.

GenAI is a tailwind, not a threat: Adobe Firefly puts generative creation where professionals already work (Photoshop/Illustrator/Premiere and the Firefly app) and anchors it with commercial safety - trained on Adobe Stock + public-domain content and backed by IP indemnification. That solves the single biggest enterprise barrier to AI-generated assets. Embedding GenAI into pro-grade tools raises the ceiling on productivity and broadens the addressable market without asking pros to abandon their workflow.

Capital allocation that matters now: Adobe is buying back stock “aggressively” at depressed prices; up to \~8% of float repurchased this year is plausible. With $6.6B debt, $4.9B cash (Net Debt $1.7B) against last year FCF $7.9B, balance sheet risk is de minimis; FCF/Total Debt \~120% and FCF/Net Debt \~465%. As the business matures, a dividend within five years is reasonable.

Quality that endures:

10-yr median ROIC \~23.4% (past five years >25%)

10-yr median Gross Margin 86.7% (up to \~89% last year)

10-yr median EBIT Margin 32.2% (past five years >32.9%, up to 36% last year)

10-yr median FCF Margin 37%

These are wide-moat, software-franchise numbers—precisely what you want compounding behind a buyback.

Competitive Landscape (Canva, Figma, and AI)

Canva democratizes design for individuals/SMBs with templates and drag-and-drop simplicity. It is excellent for accessibility but is not a drop-in replacement for pro-grade Adobe workflows that demand depth, color science, asset round-tripping, and granular control.

Figma excels in UI/UX with real-time, browser-native collaboration. Adobe’s steep 2022 bid signals respect for the niche and the architecture/community/ARR model - not necessarily that Adobe’s broader creative franchise is under siege. Post-deal, what matters is whether Adobe’s reported margins/ROIC crack. They haven’t.

GenAI changes how assets are made. Adobe’s edge is where that change lives (inside the pro toolchain) and how it’s made safe to use commercially. If you’re a professional with liability concerns, rights-safe creation plus indemnity is a non-negotiable.

What to Watch

The thesis breaks if we see:

Sustained single-digit revenue growth combined with multi-hundred-bps compression in gross and operating margins; ROIC fading from the mid-20s toward the mid-teens; Clear, sustained enterprise churn in pro segments (not hobbyist) or discounting/elongating renewals that imply erosion of pricing power.

Valuation

3-yr avg FCF/share: $18.12 

FCF growth: 12% (10-yr view)

Discount rate: 5% (conservative vs. \~4.04% 10-yr treasury)

Intrinsic Value: 18.12 / (.05 \^ (1.12)) = $519/share

Today’s price: \~$350/share

Margin of Safety: (519 − 350) / 519 ≈ 32%

Bargain Price (2/3 IV): $346/share

Given the franchise quality and the buyback cadence, buying somewhat above the bargain price is sensible. With >25% MOS to your IV and fundamentals that continue to look elite, this setup is favorable.

Catalysts

AI monetization inside the suite: Continued feature rollouts + attach/usage that show up in ARPU and renewal expansions. Capital returns: Ongoing repurchases at depressed prices; credible path to a dividend within five years. Narrative shift: As results hold (or improve) while the stock trades at a 2020 handle, the “AI doom” narrative becomes harder to maintain. Risks

A truly IP-safe, enterprise-grade AI competitor gaining parity within pro workflows could pressure pricing power. Execution risk in rapid AI productization (pricing, packaging, and model costs). Regulatory/M&A constraints limiting bundling or future tuck-ins. 

Conclusion

This is a classic case of a dominant, high-ROIC compounder marked down for a disruption story that hasn’t appeared in the numbers. Adobe’s economics still look like a wide-moat software franchise; GenAI is being integrated in a way that protects (and likely extends) the moat; and shareholders are getting repurchases at attractive prices. At \~$350 versus a $519 IV and a bargain price near $346, the setup is extremely attractive and the downside well-protected by cash generation, balance sheet strength, and switching-cost moats that remain firmly in place.",28,67,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1njtlhw/adobe_inc_adbe_long/,month,Stock Analysis,0.79

1nwuti4,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 05:54:07,Realistic 10-year S&P 500 Returns,"**Are 10% annual returns realistic for the next decade?**  
Most investors on the internet talks about the expected 10% annual return, based on historical returns.  
But is that true for the market today?

Historically the market is much cheaper than today, many investors seem not to care about valuations, and think AI will make explosive growth which will justify current valuations. However, we have a P/E over 31, and a Shiller P/E over 40, history tells us this won't end pretty.

Lets look at the numbers and model out the scenarios, to see what we can expect for returns.  
For this model we need a low, medium and high terminal P/E (what P/E will the S&P 500 end at in 10 years)  
and we need low, medium and high estimated earnings growth numbers.

Historically P/E has a median of 15, this is too low since it goes back to the 1800s, but in the past 50 years, the P/E median is \~20, in the past 20 and 10 years, it's \~25.

So let's go with:

* low: 20
* mid: 25
* high: 30

For growth estimations I looked at the past 20 years of earnings, 50% of the years were below or equal to 4% CAGR, which means this is most likely, and 20% of the years were above or equal to 8% CAGR.

To give some room for more expected growth, let's go with:

* low: 4%
* mid: 6.5%
* high 10% (only seen 4 times since 1880)

*(Note: these aren’t conservative.)*

We now can get the terminal value:

Terminal value = current EPS \* (expected growh rate)\^10 years  
current EPS = 219.52

From here we can see what Compounded Annual Growth Rate will get to the current share price from the terminal value in 10 years. For my estimations I get the following annual returns from the estimations:

* high: \~9% annual return
* mid: \~4.7% annual return
* low: \~1% annual return

This shows another picture of what is preached about 10% annual returns.

**Before the AI bulls comment, please read the section in my article about AI.**

The S&P 500 is priced for perfection. But perfection almost never happens. At current valuations, investors are betting on a decade of above-average growth. Growth that history tells us is unlikely to materialize, and the assumptions are based on hype.

**Fundamentals**:

While clean energy adoption will grow, oil and gas are not going away anytime soon. Major energy agencies expect modest but positive **oil demand growth** in the short term: the IEA projects roughly +0.7 mb/d per year for 2025–2026 and sees demand continuing into the late 2020s before flattening toward the decade’s end. We will need oil and gas to fuel this transition — so demand will remain resilient.

The **gold to oil ratio** also suggest **oil is extremely cheap** today, trading near historical lows: around 60 barrels per ounce of gold, versus much lower ratios historically. To revert to the mean, either oil prices must rise from \~$60 per barrel or gold prices must fall. Given current geopolitics, the latter seems more unlikely. This implies we are near the bottom for oil, at a time when many competitors are struggling with negative margins at these prices. If additional supply goes offline, this would support oil prices.

**Operations**:

Exxon has made **excellent operational and strategic decisions** in recent years, when others have been pivoting away from the industry. Its integrated model stabilizes earnings by balancing upstream (oil production) and downstream (refining and chemicals) operations. Today, refining margins are not that great, but Exxon's upstream business is so efficient — with some of the **lowest extraction costs in the industry** — **that it is still highly profitable at $60 oil**.

The company is also showing conviction in its future. Exxon is committing around **$30 billion per year in capital expenditures through 2030**, focusing on advantaged, high-return projects. To put that in perspective, Exxon's profit after tax was $34 billion in 2024. This shows how confident they are in the future of the industry. In the near term, their massive **new oil resources in Guyana** will come online very soon which is going to add to their portfolio of steady oil flows for decades to come.

These projects are expected to **add roughly $20 billion in annual profit by 2030, essentially doubling** current earnings. For a company of Exxon’s size, that kind of growth potential is extraordinary. Within five years, this should translate into an even stronger and potentially dominant market position.



**Valuations**:

From an investor’s standpoint, Exxon is also compelling. The company has i**ncreased its dividend for 42 consecutive years** — longer than I’ve been alive (and I already have grey hair). The dividend has **grown at about** **6% annually**, which is impressive consistency. Exxon also continues to repurchase shares, returning even more value to shareholders.

On valuation, Exxon currently trades at a **P/E ratio of around 15.** That is higher than during the Covid downturn, when the stock was a true bargain, but still reasonable in historical context. To me, it remains a no-brainer to begin building exposure. And if market volatility offers another bargain entry point, I will add a good chunk to my position for sure.

Concluding, Exxon combines reliable income, disciplined long-term growth, and a resilient integrated model. Oil demand will persist for decades, and Exxon’s low-cost production and bold capital allocation set it apart from peers. For long-term investors, it is both a cornerstone holding and an opportunity for significant upside if oil prices re-rate.

But it got me thinking: are we collectively undervaluing the potential for long-term compounding in industries that are more “boring” but still essential to modern economies?

Consider examples like waste management, railroads, specialty chemicals, or niche industrial parts suppliers. These firms often:

-Operate in oligopolistic markets with high barriers to entry.

-Have recurring, sticky demand regardless of economic cycles.

-Generate significant free cash flow, which gets returned to shareholders or reinvested efficiently.

-Benefit from inflation pass-through in ways investors don’t always price in.

-When you zoom out, a business growing earnings at 7–10% annually for decades—without major disruption risk—might actually outperform many higher-growth, higher-volatility tech bets (especially if bought at a fair valuation).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1n8lvsw/cnc\_centene\_corp\_deep\_value\_near\_term\_2\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1n8lvsw/cnc_centene_corp_deep_value_near_term_2_bagger/)

Still accumulating adding to my position as well, at 86K shares around the $32-$33 cost basis.

I'll also try to keep this short and sweet. Please do post any questions/thoughts in the comments and I'll try to answer as I get time.

I wanted post a follow-up here for **what we can expect for 2026 EPS if the ACA extended subsidies get extended for the short-term and if they don't.  This will directly impact Centene's EPS for 2026.**

The reason being is that the deadline for the funding gap is on 9/30, and from everything I've researched, there is a lot of discussion on the possibility of the extended ACA subsidies being extended for the short term (at least an extension of 1 year).  Please view the articles below for context.

Resources:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/us/politics/obamacare-subsidies-government-shutdown-congress.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/us/politics/obamacare-subsidies-government-shutdown-congress.html)

[https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-set-fight-health-care-government-shutdown-looms/story?id=125510403](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-set-fight-health-care-government-shutdown-looms/story?id=125510403)

So, we know for 2026, if enrollment is flat, here is what EPS will be based on the new ACA rates approved/being approved in the remaining states, and what we went over in the first thread:

* **ACA margin 2026:** **2.5–3.0%** after the repricing.
* **Consolidated HBR:** **90.0–90.5%**. (It may be slightly higher, but should gradually trend lower throughout 2026)
* **Implied 2026 EPS:** **$5.8** if enhanced subsidies **expire** but enrollment is flat; **$6.0** if they’re **extended** (bigger, healthier pool).

But if the extended ACA subsidies don't get extended for one year, what are worst case scenarios?

On the latest call, Sarah London (CEO) mentioned if they weren't extended, expect a drop in ACA enrollment in the middle of 15% to 50%, so 32.5%.

**And here's how any enrollment change would impact EPS:**

Every **1%** swing in ACA enrollment = **± $0.02 EPS** (directional).

Plugging the baselines we’ve been using for 2026 given the weighted average ACA price increase, weight by members per each of Centene's states they operate within, **the average is around a 27% ACA price increase for Centene approved (some states still remain to be approved):**

* ACA premium revenue on flat enrollment ≈ **$52.2B**
* ACA operating margin ≈ **2.8–3.1%** (low single-digit positive)
* Tax rate ≈ **19%**
* Diluted shares ≈ **540M**

For a **1%** enrollment change (holding rate mix constant):

* EPS = 52.2B × 1% × 2.8–3.1% × 81% ÷ 540M ≈ **$0.022–$0.024** per 1%

Rounded: **≈$0.02 EPS per 1%** is a solid directional guide for small-to-moderate enrollment moves.

**So, if enrollment drops by 32.5% due to extended ACA subsidies not being extended, this calculates out to $4.50 in EPS for 2026.**

**But if the extended ACA subsidies get extended for the short term, affecting 2026, then with flat enrollment, EPS would be at $6.0, due to the less sicklier pool**, so about $0.20 in EPS above the $5.80 if the extended subsidies weren't passed but enrollment was flat for ACA.

Thus the close to worst case scenario range to the likely scenario if the extended subsidies are passed is from $4.50 to $6.00 in EPS for 2026, which should help in painting a picture on the margin of safety and downside/upside.

At a 10 PE of 2026 EPS, shares would be from $45 to $60, depending on whether the extended ACA subsidies are extended or not.

There are no congress meetings on the third week of September given Jewish holidays, and when they return, it'll be the 29th, leaving only one day remaining, so it seems they are aiming to reach a deal next week.  Whether or not the extended ACA subsidies are extended for one more year or not, the above should provide some insight on what we can expect for EPS impact for 2026.  If they are extended, it may be a catalyst upwards for the share price, due to it positively impacting EPS and eliminating a large headwind of ACA enrollments going down without the extended ACA subsidies present.",21,8,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nffloy/centene_cnc_followup_for_the_impact_aca_subsidies/,month,Stock Analysis,1.0

1ny05x8,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 13:34:00,Why Pfizer is a massive buy,"Let's be honest, owning Pfizer for the last few years has been brutal. The stock's been hammered since the COVID highs, and the market is pricing it for dead. The story is that the sugar rush from the pandemic is over, and what's left is just a boring, slow-growth pharma giant facing a patent cliff.

But I think the market has this completely wrong. They're looking backwards at declining vaccine sales. When you look at what's actually happening under the surface, you see a company making some huge, smart moves for the future.

First, they just cut a landmark deal with the White House that takes a massive political risk (crippling tariffs, price controls) completely off the table. That alone is a game-changer. Second, they're using their COVID cash to build two new sources of growth. They spent $43 billion buying Seagen, a world leader in next-generation cancer drugs, and just made another multi-billion dollar purchase to get into the massive obesity market.

And the stock is dirt cheap. It's trading at a P/E ratio of around 14.5 while the S&P 500 is at nearly 24. On top of that, you get paid a 6.3% dividend yield just to wait for everyone else to catch on.

The market sees a value trap, but I see a de-risked, high-yield innovator at a cheap price.

1nxuaud,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 09:40:49,Pets at Home Group Plc,"Ticker: PAHGF

UK's largest pet supplies retailer. Has its hands in every part of the lifetime of the pet. Toys, food, grooming, vet care, you name it all under the same roof. Loyalty program leads to stickiness in customers and its large presence and essential services creates a moat. Add to this that the pet industry is often considered recession-resistant I think this could be a good pick.

They are looking for a new CEO after the immediate departure of the old CEO after she issued a drop in previous profit guidance for the year, new one being 100 million pounds. Issue is that people in the UK are suffering from low salaries & inflation so the pet market is subdued. So the instability has put a lot of downward pressure on the stock.

So that is the risk. Value here is that they have consistently returned capital to shareholders, we have a 5.65% dividend yield at a PE of 12.6 + a very manageable debt (just 2x free cash flow). Good buyback program in place and they consistently reduce no. of total shares by 3-5% each year.

Near term turbulence, good financials, decent moat.

1nxsfij,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 08:17:16,Capital B is like btc in 2011,"Why Capital B deserves attention among Bitcoin equities

Capital B is quietly building what MicroStrategy made famous but doing it in a cleaner, more disciplined and fully European way.
Here’s what sets it apart. 

1. Pure Bitcoin exposure
Capital B’s balance sheet is made up entirely of Bitcoin - 100 %. No trading, no derivatives, no hedging.
The company doesn’t speculate, it accumulates. Its only goal: increase the number of sats per share over time. The purest publicly-listed Bitcoin play in Europe.

2. Regulated European structure
Listed on Euronext Paris, Capital B operates under full EU regulation (AMF, IFRS, AML). Institutional investors, funds and individuals can gain Bitcoin exposure without self-custody or U.S. regulatory risk. It bridges traditional equity markets and the Bitcoin economy.

3. Zero debt, zero leverage
Unlike MicroStrategy (levered with billions in convertibles), Capital B carries no debt at all. No margin calls No liquidation risk No dilution spiral. An unlevered treasury built to survive any bear market.

4. Value-accretive capital raises
When Capital B issues new shares, it does so at a premium to NAV. That means every raise increases the BTC per share ratio for all holders. It’s one of the few listed companies where new capital = higher intrinsic value.

5. Long-term investor base
Roughly 62 % of shares are held by long-term investors : founders, strategic funds (TOBAM, Fulgur Ventures), and early Bitcoin figures like Adam Back. This creates a natural volatility buffer: when weak hands sell, the core doesn’t.
Few Bitcoin equities have a shareholder base this stable.

6. Transparency & proof of holdings
Regular public updates include:
Bitcoin holdings
Average purchase price
Share count/NAV
Treasury changes

Anyone can verify the real BTC per share - a level of transparency most ETFs don’t offer.

7. Small-cap asymmetry
With a market cap near €100 – 150M (depending on BTC price), Capital B still has high convexity. A doubling of Bitcoin’s price could easily mean more than a doubling of the stock due to scarcity, liquidity, and sentiment effects. The early-stage version of what MicroStrategy became after its first BTC cycle.

Capital B = Europe’s clean Bitcoin treasury.
100 % Bitcoin exposure
0 % debt / 0 % derivatives
Regulated & transparent
62 % held by long-term investors
High convexity + low structural risk

It’s not a meme stock — it’s a disciplined Bitcoin treasury built for the next decade.

1nxqila,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 06:33:01,Is The Platform Group (TPG) a Value Trap?,"So I’ve been digging into The Platform Group (ETR: TPG), and on paper the numbers look too good to be true. Super low P/E, growth story across 20+ platforms (48.2 % latest half), raised guidance, etc. At first glance, it screams “hidden gem.”

But the more I look, the more I feel like this could be a value trap — and I can’t quite put my finger on the exact reason.

A few things that stand out to me:

Revenue growth looks strong, but a lot of it is acquisition-driven. Yes, management says ~59% of growth was organic, which sounds good, but I still wonder how sustainable that is across so many different verticals.

They’re very acquisitive. Constantly buying new platforms in different industries. That creates complexity and execution risk, and makes it hard to judge whether the “core” business is actually stable.

The valuation is extremely cheap (like 3.2x free cash flow, do they have quite a bit of debt because of acquisitions,  ev to fcf is 5.2 ), and they still expect to grow 17 precent next year) That makes me think the market knows something I don’t. Sometimes cheap really does mean cheap for a reason.

My gut feeling: TPG might be a classic roll-up play where acquisitions boost the top line, but eventually integration, debt, or flatlining organic growth could catch up.

Does anyone here have a stronger view on this? Am I overthinking it and this is just a massively overlooked stock, or is there a hidden bear case (governance, leverage, industry cycles) that explains why it’s priced like this?

Curious to hear other opinions and maybe somebody found something i didn't.

Still in the process of learning how to analyse stocks. I finally took my courage in hand and opened for the first time a 10-k form. I opened Cadence Design, as I thought the business was interesting with a reasonably strong MOAT. 

What struck me is how analytical and research/statistic-oriented it is. Everything is very factual, number-driven. I guess it is normal for a SEC filling? I looked up the CEO, and he is an Electrical Engineer doctor (which seem to reflect well the tone of the paper I read).

Now comes my question. What are you trying to find out when reading a 10-k filling, especially when trying to figure out the overall business mind? Because I surprised myself wondering: Management and CEO obviously are top of their fields, but can it translate well in long-term business growth ? Numbers seem good too - is it the most important (only way) to look at it ?

1nx26pt,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 11:25:30,$BWB - Disciplined Regional Bank: The case for Bridgewater Bancshares,"Ticker: $BWB - Bridgewater Bancshares
Price(as of posting): $17.07
YTD: +28% (started ~13, has climbed as earnings and buybacks held up)


Why I’m watching-

Earnings: Q2 EPS beat ($0.37 vs $0.35 est). Net interest margin widened 11 bps QoQ. Nonperforming assets remain ~0.2% — very clean credit.

Book value: Tangible book per share is up to $14.21 as of June 30, 2025 (from $13.49 YE 2024).

Capital return: They’ve been buying stock.
2024: ~446k shares at $11.60 avg (~1.6% of float).

Q2 ’25: another 122k at $12.80 avg ($1.6M).
$13.1M remains under the plan, extended through Aug ’26.

Growth outlook: Management is guiding for mid–high single digit loan growth in 2025 and expects margin to hold or expand modestly if rates cooperate.

Valuation:
P/E ~14× (peers ~9–12×, higher-quality niche banks 12–13×).

P/B ~1.0–1.2× (tangible ~1.2×); sector avg ~1.1–1.2×, strong names 1.3–1.5×+.

So it’s near fair vs peers but with upside if ROE/margins hold.


Rate backdrop:

The Fed already cut 25 bps in Sept ’25. Loan yields will drift down, but BWB’s reported deposit costs have also started to fall (3.40% → 3.18% Q1 → 3.16% Q2). If deposit costs keep easing, margins can hold. If they stay sticky while loans reset lower, NIM compresses.

Minnesota macro tailwinds:

State finances are solid: Minnesota ended FY24 with revenues above forecast and continued job/wage growth.
The Minneapolis Fed’s Ninth District data shows a stable labor market and steady business activity, not booming, but resilient.

State development programs (like the Growth Loan Fund for small businesses) and healthy tax receipts help commercial lending demand.
Housing/new construction has cooled a bit with higher rates, but population and business activity keep the credit environment stable for a Twin Cities–focused lender.


What are the risks?

Deposit costs stay sticky as rates fall, squeezing margin.

Concentration: Top 10 borrowers ~18% of loans, top 10 depositors ~17% of deposits.

CRE exposure: Local commercial real estate weakness would hit harder than for diversified banks.
Capital/regulatory limits could slow buybacks.
Integration risk from the First Minnetonka City Bank acquisition.


So where could we be headed?

Base: $17.50–$20 if margins stay intact and loan growth materializes.

Bear: $12–$14 if deposit costs remain high or CRE credit cracks.

Bull: $22+ if ROE stays strong, FMCB integrates cleanly, and they keep buying stock near book.

A small but disciplined regional bank: clean credit, growing tangible book, active buybacks, fair valuation, and a stable Minnesota economy to lend into. The bet is steady ROE + capital return + possible re-rating. It’s not a moonshot, but a well-priced buy & hold.",0,0,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nx26pt/bwb_disciplined_regional_bank_the_case_for/,new,Stock Analysis,0.5

Shares tanked 13-20% on the news alone, and UNH's response? ""We're cooperating"" while hiding behind ""independent audits"" that conveniently say they're accurate.

1nwuti4,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 05:54:07,Realistic 10-year S&P 500 Returns,"**Are 10% annual returns realistic for the next decade?**  
Most investors on the internet talks about the expected 10% annual return, based on historical returns.  
But is that true for the market today?

Historically the market is much cheaper than today, many investors seem not to care about valuations, and think AI will make explosive growth which will justify current valuations. However, we have a P/E over 31, and a Shiller P/E over 40, history tells us this won't end pretty.

Lets look at the numbers and model out the scenarios, to see what we can expect for returns.  
For this model we need a low, medium and high terminal P/E (what P/E will the S&P 500 end at in 10 years)  
and we need low, medium and high estimated earnings growth numbers.

Historically P/E has a median of 15, this is too low since it goes back to the 1800s, but in the past 50 years, the P/E median is \~20, in the past 20 and 10 years, it's \~25.

So let's go with:

* low: 20
* mid: 25
* high: 30

For growth estimations I looked at the past 20 years of earnings, 50% of the years were below or equal to 4% CAGR, which means this is most likely, and 20% of the years were above or equal to 8% CAGR.

To give some room for more expected growth, let's go with:

* low: 4%
* mid: 6.5%
* high 10% (only seen 4 times since 1880)

*(Note: these aren’t conservative.)*

We now can get the terminal value:

Terminal value = current EPS \* (expected growh rate)\^10 years  
current EPS = 219.52

From here we can see what Compounded Annual Growth Rate will get to the current share price from the terminal value in 10 years. For my estimations I get the following annual returns from the estimations:

* high: \~9% annual return
* mid: \~4.7% annual return
* low: \~1% annual return

This shows another picture of what is preached about 10% annual returns.

**Before the AI bulls comment, please read the section in my article about AI.**

The S&P 500 is priced for perfection. But perfection almost never happens. At current valuations, investors are betting on a decade of above-average growth. Growth that history tells us is unlikely to materialize, and the assumptions are based on hype.

What do high valuations, AI-driven expectations, and historical market corrections mean for the coming decade?

1nwondf,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 23:37:11,Most Value Investors Under perform in the long run.,"Hey All,

I want to make it clear from the beginning, I am no one to criticize anyone else. I just want to express my humble opinion on value investing. Please take this in the best manner, i have no intention to come off as rude, arrogant or overall just a real annoying critique.

I think most people read graham or maybe the new value investors don't because of shortened attention spans. Look what worked for graham was only true because the markets were wholly inefficient and he just applied common sense, buffets early partnerships made some changes and showed signs of the shift to quality but mainly went of graham principles. Munger changes that of course, and today i believe that is really the right way to go. Most value investors statistically underperform; they just get caught up in the whole cheap thing, which is just outdated, and is a lot harder to make greater returns on. Spin offs special situations such things are not really my cup of tea, my thoughts on quant in value investing is that if dcf and the rest of qaunt analysis were so great, anyone with a computer and some algorithms would be making great returns. the former is of course not true.

What is true is finding high quality businesses with competitive advantages and barriers of entry that can be bought at a reasonable fair price. For this one must accumulate insanse amounts of knowledge to be ready when such a opportunity arises, they must research like Li Lu's famous timberland story, and 99% won't. I think that there is oppurtunity, just not for those looking for net - nets for the most part, its just a lot more difficult and the odds are not in your favour. The talks on microsoft and other big names are fine, but 20x earnings is not reasonable, and beyond tech stocks what are the real competitive advantages of LULU for example since thats trendy, i never see that. Maybe i am biased to Munger, but the numbers back him, the logic and common sense as well. 

Just my thoughts.

By Jordan Blum

Editor, Energy

October 2, 2025 at 3:30 PM EDT

The big move by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to buy the chemicals business of oil giant Occidental Petroleum for nearly $10 billion is a double win for Berkshire, analysts say, in Buffett’s potential swan song deal before retiring at the end of December.  The Oct. 2 deal is the first-ever Berkshire announcement that quotes incoming CEO Greg Abel and doesn’t mention the current chief executive by name.

The OxyChem business will operate as a strong stand-alone for Berkshire, while the deal should boost Berkshire’s nearly 30% ownership of parent Oxy because the Houston company will use the bulk of the proceeds to pay off the high debt load that’s dragged down its stock in recent years, said Doug Leggate, Wolfe Research energy analyst.

“It’s genius. It’s certainly a win-plus for Berkshire because it also helps the company that they own 30% of,” Leggate said. “It’s completely self-serving, it’s logical, and—not in any nefarious way—definitely helpful.”

The $9.7 billion, all-cash OxyChem deal is Berkshire’s largest since scooping up insurance player Alleghany in 2022. In recent years, Berkshire has focused on selling off stakes of its investments and is sitting on a whopping mound of almost $350 billion in cash.

Leggate called OxyChem a steady potential cash cow that focuses on its growing chlor-alkali business manufacturing PVC (polyvinyl chloride) resin for piping, construction materials, medical equipment, and more. Its business largely moves with the housing market, which could soon benefit more from falling interest rates. “It’s a low-volatile, uncontroversial, niche business that has pricing power given the market structure,” he said.

The 95-year-old Buffett announced his retirement plans in May, although Abel has long been tapped as his eventual successor.  Abel, the longtime Berkshire vice chairman of noninsurance operations, praised the OxyChem deal and Oxy CEO Vicki Hollub in the announcement.

“Berkshire is acquiring a robust portfolio of operating assets, supported by an accomplished team,” Abel said in the announcement. “We look forward to welcoming OxyChem as an operating subsidiary within Berkshire. We commend Vicki and the Occidental team for their commitment to Occidental’s long-term financial stability, as demonstrated by their plan to use proceeds to reinforce the company’s balance sheet.”

Berkshire did not immediately respond to interview requests.

Specifically, Oxy said, it will use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce debt and bring its principal debt below the $15 billion target it set following the late 2023 acquisition of Permian Basin oil producer CrownRock for $12 billion.  Hollub said the deal helps Oxy focus on its core oil and gas business, especially in the booming Permian, while strengthening its financial position through debt reduction.

OxyChem represents almost 20% of Oxy’s total pretax income, bringing in more than $1 billion annually.

**The Berkshire-Oxy courtship**

The intimate Berkshire-Oxy relationship dates back to 2019 when Oxy entered a dramatic bidding war with the much larger Chevron to acquire oil producer Anadarko Petroleum.  Anadarko had chosen to sell to Chevron when Oxy came back with a larger $38 billion offer that included much more cash—too good for Anadarko to turn down.

That offer only came to fruition when Hollub took a whirlwind trek to Omaha to see Warren Buffett and his Berkshire team. After a 90-minute meeting, Buffett committed $10 billion to finance the merger in exchange for preferred shares and a stake in the expanded Oxy.

The agreements allowed Oxy to boost its cash offer to about 80% of the purchase price in its successful David-versus-Goliath bidding war against Chevron.

Since then, Buffett has increased Berkshire’s stake in Oxy to more than 28%.

But in the meantime, the big acquisitions left Oxy with a much greater debt load, especially going into the pandemic in 2020. Oxy barely survived the downturn, slashing its dividend from 79 cents per share each quarter down to just one penny. Since then, the dividend has risen back up to 24 cents—still much lower than in 2019.

The OxyChem deal largely solves the debt problem, although Oxy won’t begin redeeming Berkshire’s preferred shares—and their 8% annual interest—until 2029.

“In a world where crude \[pricing\] is softening, Oxy has too much debt. It’s unequivocal that it’s a good thing for Oxy to raise cash and pay down debt,” said Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Pickering Energy Partners consulting and research firm.

While Abel may already be in the dealmaking driver’s seat for Berkshire, Pickering said, “\[Buffett\] was the driver of the original Oxy investment, so I’m sure he was involved.”

Pickering compared Berkshire’s likely double win for both OxyChem and Oxy to a “circular loop” like the booming AI sector’s recent investments in one another’s companies: “AI is in a circular loop where Nvidia gives money to somebody, who gives money to somebody, who gives it back to Nvidia.”

The only problem for Oxy on Oct. 2, though, was its stock surprisingly fell by 7%. Oxy had outperformed the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF by about 2.5% this week through Oct. 1, largely baking in the deal before the Oct. 2 announcement.

Oxy is selling its chemicals business at a bit of a discount when the broader petrochemical sector is near a cyclical trough.

Pickering said there was some “sell the news dynamic” at play. But the sale also diminishes some hopes that Berkshire would buy Oxy in its entirety, potentially hurting the stock.

“By buying these pieces, the odds that he’s going to buy it all have gone down,” Pickering said.

A year ago, this reporter asked Hollub at what point Berkshire might control too much Oxy stock. Her response: “We would never consider it to be too much.”",209,18,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwinqk/warren_buffetts_berkshire_hathaway_may_have/,new,Buffett,0.96

What most fail to realize stuck in this trap is that they're likely going to underperform the index with a high degree of certainty - Which begs the question why are you working so hard to lock in mediocrity?

Understand that benchmark 10% returns P/A should be your discount rate and what you apply to your stock valuation calculations - not a 10/20 Year treasury - This achieves 2 things: You start looking for companies growing higher than the index and you naturally will be purchasing them at a lower price because of a higher discount rate.

Dividend investing is dead and likely to become worse - People thinking about cash flow when their purchasing power is declining not to mention the risk of the stock going down below your purchase price and yielding less % on your $ invested - You're better off owning real estate and getting rental income with some capital appreciation - and if you can't afford Real estate why bother chasing cash flow on peanuts lol - you're essentially falling behind even faster - the other option would be a term deposit if you're at a stage in life where preservation is more important than growth and the yield on cost is higher than real estate rental income.

If you're not prepared to gamble in markets somewhat for out performance you may as well call it a day and just own the index and accept your fate.

Holding cash if you don't have great entries on stuff now makes some sense because it allows you the opportunity to buy bargains when markets shit the bed/good companies fall out of favor. (you will naturally be doing this while using a 10% discount rate) and have a list of companies you want to own.

I think this is one of those opportunities I found pretty recently.

**Steep Hill Inc.** (formerly known as Canbud Distribution Corporation) was incorporated to provide hemp-based science-backed products and services. It started the wind-down and stopped operations at the end of 2022. The business has been trying to acquire other businesses to continue operations, unsuccessfully. This seems to be their current strategy, to find and acquire another business. The businesses' filings doesn't give the updated balance sheet report, but I found the updated working capital in the foot notes. based on the 2024 filing, I can see they have no long term liabilities, so this working capital number I found is the up to date liquidation value of the business.

**These figures are in (CAD)**

* $56,000 in cash
* $2,000,000 in deposits
* $106,000 in liabilities
* NCAV(liquidation value): $1,950,000
* Market Cap: $1,050,000
* Share Price: $0.065
* Under Valued: by 46%

**Risks**

Possible current share dilution authorized for the management is 8%.

The real risk of this shell style business is slow burn of cash over time. If we estimate a 300k burn a year, this business is still at a liquidation value of 1.35M in 2 years, at which point I'd sell it if the management didn't make any meaningful change.

**Predicted Outcome**

The most likely outcome is a slow burn of cash over a year, then the business acquires another business and improves/continues operation. In this case, the business will be 36% under valued when it unlocks value for the shareholders, which would be a 57% return.

The next most likely is that they have a merger/acquisition sale to another business, or liquidate their business.

* If they do it immediately, the return is an 86% return.
* If they wait a year before doing this, it will be a 57% return.
* If they wait 2 years before doing this, it will be a 29% return.

My position size is 5.5% of my capital, and I plan on holding onto this stock for 2-3 years, or until the market cap gets close to the NCAV(liquidation value).",3,17,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwh991/little_ben_graham_cigarbutt_if_youd_like_a_puff/,new,Stock Analysis,0.8
1nwg9lu,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 17:14:08,Securities analysis is a deluded fallacy. ( Under the current monetary regime.),"
Don’t shoot me, I’m just a messenger.

However, my assertion is quite straightforward:

Under our current monetary system, which relies heavily on hyper-stimulated credit injections into the economy, securities analysis and business valuation have become almost irrelevant. This is due to the unreliable nature of economic calculations caused by central banking monetary policies.

The financial economy serves as the primary conduit for central banking policies. Financial assets experience an initial surge in value before the underlying economy has fully assessed the viability of capital investments. This disconnection fuels the boom, leading to further capital misallocation into speculative ventures with minimal real demand or profit potential.

Essentially, stocks rise and continue to rise due to the influence of the Federal Reserve. Wall Street exacerbates this situation through its marketing and pressure-selling tactics. After all, Wall Street’s primary revenue streams are securitization and trading. As the boom continues to grow and persist, Wall Street’s wealth increases accordingly.

Therefore, professional investors, most hedge fund managers, financial gurus, social media promoters, and most “professionals” in finance are essentially opportunistic beneficiaries of easy money and loosened credit injections into the financial markets.

For instance, consider Warren Buffett’s case. In 1980, he was worth $500 million and was already one of the wealthiest individuals in the world. Back then, there were only 13 billionaires worldwide. Fast forward 40 years, and Warren Buffett’s net worth has skyrocketed to $150 billion, while the global number of billionaires has increased to 3,000. Simultaneously, the value of the dollar has declined by nearly 74% in the same period. This means that while savers have been impoverished, asset holders have experienced significant wealth effect.

And you wonder why you can’t afford a home Millennial!!! (lol)

The value of Buffett’s wealth is not solely attributed to his exceptional stock-picking abilities but rather to his long-term investments in high-quality financial assets added and abetted by inflation.


All these financial metrics and accounting calculations are meaningless in an inflationary environment. However, accountants, CPAs, CFAs, academics, MBAs, and other investment experts need to earn a living, so they market their systems, books, newsletters, and other products to the public.

Essentially, the entire investment industry is somewhat  a pyramid scheme built on easy money. The moment the Federal Reserve reduces its money supply, the entire system collapses quickly.

Fortunately for the Wall Street professionals and gamblers , the current neo-Keynesian academics at the helm of the Federal Reserve have no intention of ever cutting off the flow of money and credit. Therefore, the boom may continue and spread to other tokenized vehicles and investment schemes.

The good news is that you can simply buy and hold great businesses and forget about it. Cash is toxic!

By the way,

Ben Graham operated under a more sound financial system, similar to Natural Finance under the Gold Standard. Since 1971, the world has entered an era of inflation and a fiat financial system. Securities analysis and economic calculation cannot be conducted in the same way in both regimes.

Algoma Steel (ASTL) trades at ~$3.20 USD with recent weakness tied to soft steel pricing and tariff pressures. Q2 results showed declining revenue, negative EBITDA margins, and a net loss, with shipments around 472K tons. Balance sheet stress remains as liabilities outweigh assets, though government support has been secured. Transition to electric arc furnace (EAF) technology is underway, with first-steel production achieved, positioning for cost efficiencies and lower emissions. Near-term challenges include margin compression and high input costs, but long-term prospects hinge on EAF ramp-up, policy support, and global steel demand recovery.

My brief thesis:

* FactSet has a strong moat. The company serves institutional investors: hedge funds, asset management companies, buy-side shops, pension shops, etc... The customers either buy a FactSet terminal, or SaaS subscription.
* The customer retention rate is above 90%.
* Manageable debt.
* Strong track record of earnings growth.
* Trading at PE of 18.5 (reasonable compared to its historical average of above 25.
* Revenue is still growing at a steady pace.
* Risks: Primary risk is that the tool could be replaced by other AI saas products. Which is a fair fear to have, however they are so deeply integrated with customers that it will be hard to rip off FactSet and replace them with a new startup. FactSet has tons of historical data and expertise in financial data market, I would expect the management to innovate to fend off competitors. 
* I would like to call out that FactSet by no means is offering margin of safety like my previous investments in baba, meta, bti, and others. However it is currently trading at a fair value.
* A very general example to understand FactSet: An analyst would pull the data either through api, or dashboard, transform the data with other third party and first party data to create dashboard/reports for management.

China banned antimony export last year. since then recycling became even more attractive. they have smelter capacities, they recycle lead acid batteries, PET, Antimony, etc.  
they are the biggest producer of antimony trioxide outside of china and their share of the worlds antimony trade is over 10%.  
good amount of growth (H1 2025 had over 380 million€ in revenues) and over 24€ in EPS, which is already more than their entire record year 2024! their P/E is around 6 (if we assume that EPS for the second half will be around 11€ -which is a very conservative estimate imo) so we are assuming 35€ in EPS for the year 2025.  
this will be achieved without the acquisition which was approved yesterday. this acquisition will add another 100 million€ to yearly revenues (and cashflow-positive already - which will be even enhanced by synergy-effects, since at some place they have a surplus of metals and they will add smelting capacities..) they export into the US, Japan, India, europe and many more!  
the CEO is very conservative with predictions (you can read the last press releases) and management delivered very well over the past years.  
dividend is usually 1/3 of the Earnings so at 35€ (conservativly speaking) it will be a dividend of around 12€ so \~6% in dividends (200€ share price) .  
the interessting thing is, that the export ban of china got them a lot of new costumers in japan, india, the US etc and likely these relationships may last since campine is also consulting their costumers, since they have a big expertise (100 year company history).  
their recycling percentage will like rise (i think it was 30 or 50%) so they will hve even cheaper antimony which will enahnce margins. the downside may be, that antimony trioxide is being substituted as a flame retardand because of high prices, but in the PET production process the substitution is much less likely in the near term.  
P/S is 0.5-0.6

The press release from yesterday: [https://www.campine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251001ecoeng.pdf](https://www.campine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251001ecoeng.pdf)

Another Company that looks interessting may be global ship lease:   
they have small container ships which is a big plus imo, because climate change will have rivers at low water levels, which will enable them to manouver through low water the longest. They constantly improved their fundamentals since the new ceo took office a few years ago (less debt and higher equity etc) their P/E is around 3 and they pay over 6% in dividends. their contracts are on average over 2 years which means that they will almost earn the entire money for which the company trades at the moment (P/E 3 and over 2 years of guaranteed contracts/income streams).

1nw6ogr,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 11:19:28,Albertsons ACI - Undervalued Supermarket Chain,"Boring company but I think its a cheap defensive play especially if you think the market is expensive.

Albertsons is currently at $17.35 its valued less than 11X 2024 earnings and has an EV / Sales of 0.2. Kroger was going to pay roughly $27 a share to buy ACI but it ultimately fell through for antitrust reasons. Kroger has a PE of 17 and EV / Sales of 0.4. Weis has a PE of 17 and EV / Sales of 0.3. 

Kroger will likely have to pay Albertsons a break up fee of $600 million or roughly 6% of the stock price. Albertsons also has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $2 billion so roughly 20% of the stock. During the latest quarter they bought 14.2 million shares at $22 for a total of $314.8 million. They are likely buying even more at these decreased prices. 

2024 had lower earnings of $1.64 as compared to $2.23 in 2023 but part of that was one time expenses like those related to the expenses of a failed merger. Even if the earnings stay at the $1.64 range, which with less shares is unlikely, than the **fair price for this is around $28 - $30** with a PE of 17 or EV / Sales of 0.3 based on their peers. **So more than 60% from here**. 

Potential other upsides you could get an extra $1 from Kroger paying up the $600 million, the share count be decreased even more significantly thus increasing the earnings per share, earnings could go up now that the merger costs are behind them, and Goldman listed them as one of their top 48 potential M&A candidates with a 15% to 30% probability.

My investment thesis was that the company would return to $1900-2000 range once interest rates were cut and the housing market started to ""unfreeze"" as more buyers would be able to enter the market and find common ground with sellers, thus more transactions overall, and less pressure on FICO.

1nw21pg,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 08:12:12,Rubrik (RBRK): The Next Big Thing in Cyber AI,"Rubrik (RBRK) is a high-growth, high-upside play on cyber AI.

The company provides data security and backup software that protects and restores critical business information. Its platform takes frequent, immutable snapshots of data so organizations can recover quickly from cyberattacks or outages. Think of it as a safety net across on-prem, cloud, and SaaS environments. Rubrik also organizes metadata about what data exists, where it lives, and who accessed it — helping customers comply with regulations and insurance requirements. The business model blends subscriptions and support, with a growing emphasis on software and cloud services.

AI expands the attack surface by spreading data across vector databases, SaaS tools, and model-training pipelines. Rubrik’s edge is not just preventing damage but enabling fast recovery when things break. As more teams deploy AI agents and new data stores, backups must be frequent, tamper-resistant, and easy to restore. Rubrik’s automation and policy-driven controls standardize resilience across hybrid IT. Its platform can also surface unusual activity and guide remediation, reducing costly downtime. In an era of strict regulation and board-level cyber scrutiny, data resilience becomes essential infrastructure for AI adoption.

Rubrik has built a data graph—rich metadata on backups, versions, and relationships—that improves visibility and accelerates recovery. Immutable backups raise the bar against ransomware, a top risk for AI-heavy organizations. Deep integrations with major clouds, enterprise apps, and security platforms create stickiness and reduce complexity. Over time, telemetry from thousands of environments becomes a learning advantage for detection and response. Compliance mandates make consistent backup and recovery a requirement, not an option—supporting Rubrik’s durability at the recovery layer, where budgets remain resilient even in downturns.

As AI accelerates data creation, enterprises will spend more to protect it, favoring platforms that collapse multiple tools into one workflow. Rubrik can expand wallet share by covering more workloads and increasing backup frequency within its customer base. AI-first startups and modernized IT estates create new growth avenues. A shift toward software- and cloud-delivered services should lift margins, while cross-selling security analytics on top of backup deepens engagement. With cyberattacks frequently in the headlines, recovery-focused platforms stand to benefit from urgency and board-level attention. We see Rubrik as a ~25% revenue grower with potential for >50% compounded EBITDA growth as margins expand.

Over the next year, watch for large enterprise wins, public-sector contracts, and deeper partnerships with major cloud providers. Product launches that extend coverage to AI data stores or improve automated recovery would be notable. Tighter cyber-insurance standards could indirectly boost adoption. Migration tools for legacy backup replacements may accelerate competitive takeaways, while alliances with incident-response firms or SIEM/SOAR vendors would broaden reach. ARR growth and improving retention will be key signals for the long-term thesis",11,6,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nw21pg/rubrik_rbrk_the_next_big_thing_in_cyber_ai/,new,Stock Analysis,0.79

1nvuluv,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 00:49:36,AMZN is cheaper than you think,"So I'm sure many people are looking at AMZN's P/E ratio of 33.7x and thinking that while it's more reasonable than it used to be, it's still pretty expensive. Especially when you can pickup shares of GOOGL or META at 26x. But I think a useful valuation metric to look at is the price to operating cash flow and I'll explain why.

Net income is an accounting metric that includes depreciation and amortization, and it's up to the business to decide the schedule for those, meaning they can decide, for example, that the useful life of a GPU is 6 years when in reality it's probably 2 years. Another problem is that GAAP requires companies to mark to market any investments each quarter, meaning that if a company holds shares of a different company, the change in price effects net income.

This is why investors run discounted cash flow models, because ultimately cash is what matters--not accounting results. The value of a business is the present value of the future cash you can extract from the business over its life. The problem with using free cash flow is that capex is part of the equation, and capex is highly variable year to year. Some years you may buy a new office building and a new warehouse and a bunch of warehouse equipment, and other years you might not buy anything.

Operating cash flow removes capex from the equation which allows you to simply focus on how much cash the business actually produces from its operations. Not paper gains of a stock they hold, or because they chose to extend the useful life of their assets. Just the operations.

So on a price to trailing twelve month P/OCF ratio, here are the results for the Magnificent 7 stocks:

* TSLA: 91.3x
* NVDA: 59.0x
* AAPL: 34.9x
* MSFT: 28.3x
* GOOGL: 22.1x
* AMZN: 19.4x
* META: 17.6x

Now you might think this is stupid because free cash flows are what matter. Who cares if your operating cash flow is great but you need to spend it all on capex to continue generating the cash flow? While this is true, I think it's useful to compare just the operating businesses as capex is highly variable and is a choice that doesn't need to be made in perpetuity. Now of course, AMZN is by far the most structurally capital intensive (besides TSLA? maybe?) since they actually move real stuff in the real world so that needs to be taken into consideration. 

Anyway, just thought I'd share. I think understanding the price you're paying relative to the cash generated by operations is useful and should be considered when evaluating a business' valuation.

1nvlhpb,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 17:42:51,"Most people are better off being ""growth"" investors (including this sub)","I'm not sure if this will be insightful or dumb, but this is Reddit so there's no reason to concern myself with that... 

I think most individual investors that feel the need to buy single stocks are probably better off being what most here would describe as ""growth"" investors. (I don't agree with growth vs. value being a binary split, because growth is obviously a component of value). The market today isn't filled with net-nets (there are some), cigar butts, and stocks that trade at a discount to book or replacement/sale value. Those that do are often hard to find, messy and difficult to analyze. So you need to have a view on the future and growth prospects (it's not just pure speculation as Graham said so I don't wanna hear that).

I think most stock pickers are better off focusing on strong businesses that are growing and having more flexibility on P/E ratios rather than trying to find ""value"" based on stocks that have tanked recently. A large portion of this sub loves low P/E stocks or those down 30+% and overlook fundamental challenges simply because the stock went down and now it appears ""value."" You can put whatever stock du jour is the most talked about in this sub in that category most of the time... occasionally popular stocks here bounce back strongly, but I'm inclined to believe that may be more luck than skill... unless someone has a mention tracker going for testing... 

Those same folks look down on all the higher multiple stocks that the market loves that are strong and growing businesses. **I am not talking about the highest multiple or meme/hype stocks**, just quality businesses that people know and are most likely going to experience future success but trade at multiples around the broader market or \~25% premiums. There are so many commenters here that overlook quality and hate a company that's trading at or near all time highs and think they're smarter than the market. They also think they're smarter than the market after a recent drop and think that recent ""cheapness"" equates to value. **You hate that people buy stocks just because they went up, but do the exact same thing and buy stocks just because they went down**. Momentum is a powerful force especially with trading volumes mostly driven by passive and levered pod shops. You're fighting against that when you buy a recently tanked stocks, at least those picking ""obvious"" businesses have those as tailwinds. 

I think most people would be better off investing in ""obvious"" strong, growing companies even if everyone else loves them rather than focusing all their attention on things that have fallen and probably subjecting yourself to a lot of value traps. Great businesses have a tendency to surprise on the upside and their execution and I believe those going through issues and turnarounds have a tendency to surprise on the downside. This entire spiel I doubt many will read **does not apply to anyone who will take the time to deeply understand a business, it's economics, strength, and potential for the future** I just don't see a lot of that here (to be clear **I'm not claiming to have that ability either**...). 

If you want to buy some single stocks, but aren't going to make a career out of it the ""obvious"" ones might be your friend. I'd rather be consensus and right than contrarian and wrong... buy stocks because the business is strong and it's a reasonable price, don't fall in love with only a lower price. If you're absolutely must call yourself a value investor so you can look down on others without actually putting in the work just buy Berkshire Hathaway and call it a day...

Then considering the dilution from the 560 million in convertible notes at $55 (that’s your 12.5 percent). 

… basically, I bought a couple $55 January 2027 leaps that should let me ride it up over the next six months and cash out while (theoretically) we get another rate reduction or two, their expansion into the HELOC market continues, and people start to see ai underwriting actually does a better job at avoiding delinquency than the straight FICO system we use today. 

My really dumbed down thesis:

People are still afraid of ai underwriting when they shouldn’t be, and as their revenue CAGR continues to accelerate that fear will diminish. 

Upcoming rate cuts (including the recent rate cut) will provide fuel for their fire. 

Market expansion will continue, global expansion is inevitable. 


Edit: I should add the conversion notes @ about 35 bucks for around 600 million, so the total dilution is around thirty percent but that $80 per share forecast includes it.

1nvc4nn,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 11:58:03,JD Stock Forecast,"Hey everyone I have had some pretty solid calls this year on foreign equities, including BABA at $114 and JMIA at $2.40. I am back with another call and DD report on JD. 

Chinese equities have been abandoned by global investors, and JD.com is one of the clearest examples. The stock fell from over $100 in 2021 to below $30 in 2023 despite remaining profitable and holding one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector.

Today JD is valued at less than 10x earnings, 0.3x sales, and just above book value. It sits on more than $27 billion in cash and is using buybacks to reduce its float. This is an e-commerce and logistics leader trading at distressed multiples, while peers like Amazon (33x PE) and Alibaba (21x PE) command far higher valuations.

The recovery in 2025 is starting to take shape for China. Alibaba has already surged more than 70 percent this year as sentiment improves. JD has lagged, but volumes are rising, short interest is falling, and the stock recently broke resistance levels (200d SMA). The fundamentals point to double digit revenue growth, expanding profitability, and a long runway in AI, robotics, and fintech.

For my modeling into 2030, I assumed the following:

* **Revenue Growth Assumptions:** Modeled CAGR between 10–20% depending on macro conditions and market share trends.
* **Margin Expansion:** Forecasts net margins improving to 4–5% through cost efficiencies, logistics scaling, and AI-driven operations.
* **Buybacks:** $27B in cash could allow repurchase of 15–20% of shares by 2030, lifting EPS by 20–25%.
* **Peer Multiples:** Valuation targets based on Alibaba (\~21x P/E) and Amazon (30–40x P/E) suggest significant re-rating potential.
* **Scenario Analysis:**
   * Bear: $80 by 2030 (10% CAGR, 15x P/E).
   * Base: $140 by 2030 (15% CAGR, 20x P/E).
   * Bull: $200+ by 2030 (20% CAGR, 25x P/E, upside from AI/health/fintech).
* **Optionality:** Strategic investments in healthcare, fintech, and robotics are not fully priced in, so upside could exceed modeled cases.

This is not financial advice, but the setup resembles other moments of extreme mispricing that I have seen reverse sharply once capital flows return. JD’s logistics moat, authenticity focus, and cash reserves give it staying power in a very competitive market. 

Just because Chinese equities were punished for years, does not mean they always will be. Institutions can only ignore cash flows and valuations such as these for so long, particularly as US markets approach extreme overbought levels. 

For a less fundamental approach, JD historically lags than catches big moves from BABA. I see that happening here, and rather quickly as rally begins to broaden out. ",27,43,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://northwiseproject.com/jd-stock-forecast-2030/,new,Stock Analysis,0.85

1nvaaws,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 10:50:32,how do you value a company that is trying to gain market share at the expense of near-term losses,"What I mean by this is that consider you were to come across Amazon or Shopify when they were still young public companies. Now if management really wanted to, they could show investors a healthy net income with good profit margins. Instead, however, they chose to market aggressively...diluting shares, over-hiring, fighting tooth and nail to establish their footprint.

By all means if you could identify this early, you would be very rich today. And this is more than just looking at accounting statements because they don't tell the whole story. Some might say look at operating cash flow but companies might hire so aggressively and pay for top talent that it could easily be negative too.   
  
So, my question is, what can one do in this situation? Valuation might be complicated I know, but how does one even identify whether this is a good company to invest in and that they aren't just wasting money. For example, the traditional value investor could easily say, Amazon in 2010 has absolutely zero moat and that they are burning cash to give people cheaper items and faster delivery and they would eventually find competitors and the pricing wars would make everyone a loser (except the customer). My point is that it is simply not very easy when companies are in this phase to identify good from bad. So how do you approach this?

With the interest rate approaching 4.0% and especially once it falls below 4.0% I do not consider interest rates high anymore. Therefore I have to do adjustments to my current primary strategy described almost a year ago. The main idea of the original strategy was to keep most of the money in t-bills that reliably yield close to 5% and exploit the rest of the money as a tool to frequently buy and sell(cycle) dividend paying high quality stocks. The strategy allowed earning around 10% annually with almost no risk. As yields on cash fall below 4% this strategy loses its appeal and I have to do the adjustments.

Before I explain the changes let me tell you one envious thought I had for many years… Take a look at 10yr treasury yield historic chart...

Think of a guy in the 1980s who bought 10yr or especially 30yr treasury… The guy would enjoy 15% risk free return all the way until the 2010s… The world economy grew fast in the 1980s but the modern world doesn’t grow as fast mostly because of saturation and low human breeding rates. What if 5% return is equivalent to 15% in the 1980s given the low growth of the world?

The first changes to the strategy came in May and were explained in my previous blog posts. I indeed significantly increased exposure to high quality US stocks leaving me exposed to higher risk but it also provided a better than expected returns during this period. As time goes by I now face the dilemma of still incredibly rich valuations of stocks and therefore high risks of drawdowns yet I cannot keep a significant portion of portfolio in t-bills as they provide unattractive returns. Therefore about a month ago I started the transition of t-bills based strategy to bond based strategy. I do not hold any t-bills anymore and now the money is either in stocks or bonds… This significantly increased my risk exposure but bonds will provide a much higher yield of around 6% while still being a relatively low risk instrument. The main reason why I think bonds are ok now is that I do not expect significantly higher inflation as the transition of the new administration tariffs as well as certain reduction in government expenses in certain areas show signs of fiscal responsibility and hopefully the inflation will be tamed.

The stocks strategy also changed slightly. I do not cycle dividend stocks as much as I used to and keep stock ownership much longer as well as increased exposure to some high quality stocks with lower dividend yields. I continue to buy and sell the same stocks though. So some cycling is still happening but less of it. So here it is. This is what I am doing now for the next 3-6 months. Then we will review again.

1nuy1s9,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 23:46:52,How Dating and Investing Are Similar-,"When a person is in their youth, let’s call it from sixteen to thirty years old, finding a life partner is of interest, if not a high priority, for many people. There are societies where cultural norms dictate the available universe of potential mates. The approach one takes in finding a potential mate is as diverse as there are humans. Some might place a high priority on physical appearance. Others might place a heavier weighting on friendship and compatibility. Let’s consider two approaches. The first person is a social butterfly who is active in the bar scene. Each weekend, they go with their friends to a local club to have a good time and enjoy the allure of finding their one-in-a-million dreamboat. On occasion, they might drink a few too many beverages and engage in extracurricular activities where they wind up in situations where they don’t quite remember, or are comfortable with, the person they are now faced with, or, um, ahem, even closer.

The second person approaches their social activities differently. They concentrate on attending weekly and monthly religious ceremonies and events. A heightened emphasis is placed on understanding where the potential mate is from, meeting their parents, and spending time learning what makes them happy, sad, indifferent, or excited. A friendship is formed through learning, and a common bond is established over their shared views on various subjects in which they both participate. Clearly, these are distinct approaches to the same problem. We can apply this idea to the current state of affairs in the investment world.

As of August 2025, in US public markets, there are currently approximately 4,300 ETFs (exchange traded funds) as compared to 4,200 publicly traded companies. In terms of recent trends, the number of ETFs grew by approximately 4 per day in 2025, while the available publicly traded companies continued to shrink, losing nearly 500 in 2024 alone, down from 6,500 in 1997. I bring this up because the investment world has been moving to a passive approach for a long time, and the amount of capital allocated to index and ETF-based approaches is now [greater than the active ](https://www.globaltrading.net/passive-funds-extend-their-dominance-in-equity-investments-in-2024/)methods.

Over the last few decades, the S&P 500 has been the star performer of all indexes. Currently, 35% of the S&P 500 is made up of seven companies. Many other ETFs have a similar dynamic where a few companies constitute a heavy weight within the instrument. Prominent examples include the QQQ, IVV, SPLG, VOO, VGT, and TOPT, not to mention the Ark fund complex. Investors are drawn to the lower risk, ease, and cost of indexes and ETFs and have been rewarded by owning instruments tied to large tech companies, which have grown substantially. The enthusiasm for artificial intelligence over the last few years has led to high-profile recent offerings like ARTY, CHAT, BAI, AGNT, and IVES. Investors who adopt this approach believe what has been working will continue to work. The current valuations of these assets are, let’s be kind, historically elevated. How do I approach the market knowing these facts?

One caveat, I am an active investor, so I am biased, and I am talking my book. ETFs are made up of different assets, but in most or many cases, the holdings are individual public companies. One is a derivative of the other. If you understand derivatives, you know the secondary is a function of the primary. As such, what matters is the performance of the core companies. The ETFs will rise, and fall based on those entities. So, for an active investor, more attention to ETFs is good because less capital is directed toward finding and analyzing individual companies. The number of individually listed enterprises shrinking means the strongest survive. History has proven that Darwinian concepts are applicable in markets as well. It has long been understood that the small and micro-cap areas are the most inefficient areas of the market. Inefficiency is good for active investors because it means mis-pricing. It is also excellent for active investment because if one is accurate about the analysis of a small company, the runway for expansion is much greater than a bigger entity. Conversely, investors who allocate capital into areas where there is more competition and great enthusiasm are placing a great deal of belief in the premise that massive amounts of capital allocation will yield acceptable returns. When large amounts of money are involved, just because it is spent doesn’t mean an above-average return is earned. Look at what Stevie baby spent on the Mets payroll this year, and uh, no playoffs again. In sum, less competition, fewer investors looking, mis-priced assets, large expansion possibilities versus greater numbers of instruments, top-heavy weighted assets, recent outperformance, and elevated valuations. Capital will flow where it is best treated. Markets change, like nearly everything else, though often it takes decades, not years for the difference to become evident. What one chooses is based on their own perceptions, just like choosing an ideal mate. Future returns depend on your selection, so be thoughtful.",0,7,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nuy1s9/how_dating_and_investing_are_similar/,new,Stock Analysis,0.36

Mods. I understand this isn’t a typical value post. However, if the headline claims are true and $BMNR does hold $13B in ETH, this is the easiest value play ever. Just buy when Stock < NAV.

However, here are my concerns.

BitMine is a strange one. Their balance sheet shows only about $7M in assets, yet their press releases claim they hold over $13B worth of Ethereum. If that were true, they’d either be reporting billions of crypto on their balance sheet like MicroStrategy does, or they’d disclose assets under custody like Coinbase. They do neither. Instead, they issue sensational PRs while filing bare-bones financials with the SEC. To make things stranger, their previous auditor was banned by the PCAOB for issuing false audit opinions, and their new auditor is another tiny firm with its own compliance history. There’s no clear source of funds for these supposed ETH purchases, no custody revenues, and no on-chain proof. It looks less like a real business and more like a shell pumping hype with numbers that don’t add up.

Afterwards, the “AI is going to eat software” narrative hit the sector. Earnings were fine but the market punished it for hair’s breadth miss for next quarter’s EPS guidance. The Data Cloud and Agentforce combo segment grew by 120% y-o-y to an annualized revenue of $1.2 billion. Not bad for a $40 billion revenue company but obviously didn’t set pulses racing.

The whole sector has been whacked hard over the last few months. And it doesn’t help that they’re showing high correlation — one stock’s poor earnings hurt all other stocks, but good earnings for one don’t lift others (naturally).

I do believe Marc Benioff’s narrative that enterprise AI would end up along the lines of SaaS products (plays on the core skill set of software companies) rather than each company configuring their own AI solution (regular companies don’t have the software skills). Obviously, that implies the sad truth that AI would be built on top of legacy software — but isn’t that where the data repository of corporations is?

So I’m hoping that the Dreamforce conference and subsequent earnings can turn the narrative around. But I don’t know. Does it look like a stock that can trade at 25x PE any time soon, let alone 30x?

1nuonf9,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 16:42:21,Constellation Software - The King is Gone,"The market is panicking about Constellation Software after its founder, Mark Leonard, resigned. The stock is down nearly 30% from its highs, caused by fears over AI and a scary looking Q2 earnings report. I believe this is a massive overreaction and a great opportunity for long-term investors.

The biggest reason for the panic is that Mark Leonard left. He's seen as the Warren Buffett of Canada. People think the magic is gone with him. It doesn't help that AI is coming for them either. The fear is that generative AI will make their huge portfolio of niche software obsolete. The Q2 earnings also looked terrible. Net income dropped by a shocking 68%.

These fears are all very real. The thing is the company is simply a machine. Leonard built a decentralised system designed to run without him. It's not reliant on one person. His replacement is a 30-year company insider, ensuring continuity. They aren't ignoring AI either. Management held a rare call to address concerns and explained that hundreds of their business units are already integrating AI to improve products and efficiency.  
  
The Q2 earnings also weren't actually bad. That 68% drop in net income I talked about was due to non-cash accounting quirks (a massive foreign exchange loss and a charge related to the rising value of their successful Topicus spin-off). The important number, free cash flow, was actually UP 20%. The business is still printing money.

The recent sell-off is driven by fear, not fundamentals. The panic has created a chance to buy a world-class compounder at a discounted price. The valuation is now much more reasonable, trading at around 23x P/FCF. To me, this is a compelling long-term opportunity.

WSJ EXCLUSIVE

By Lauren Thomas, Ben Dummett and Benoît Morenne

Sept. 30, 2025 3:49 pm ET

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is in talks to buy Occidental Petroleum’s petrochemical business for around $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal, which would be Berkshire’s largest since 2022, could come together within days, the people said. 

Houston-based Occidental is largely known for its oil-and-gas operations. The company has a market value of around $46 billion and already counts Berkshire as its largest shareholder. 

Occidental’s petrochemical division, OxyChem, manufactures and sells chemicals for use in applications including chlorinating water, recycling batteries and producing paper. The unit generated nearly $5 billion in sales in the 12 months ended in June. 

Assuming talks don’t fall apart, the OxyChem deal would be Buffett’s second big bet on chemicals. In 2011, Berkshire acquired specialty-chemicals producer, Lubrizol, for close to $10 billion, including debt. 

The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Occidental was in talks for a $10 billion deal to sell OxyChem, without identifying the buyer. The last major deal Berkshire did was in 2022, when it agreed to pay $11.6 billion to buy insurer Alleghany. 

Buffett, 95, got involved with Occidental in 2019, as Chief Executive Vicki Hollub was trying to outbid Chevron to buy Anadarko Petroleum. In a trip facilitated by Bank of America Chief Brian Moynihan, Hollub traveled to Nebraska to visit Buffett, whose company agreed to buy $10 billion of preferred shares in Occidental to bolster her $38 billion offer. 

Occidental’s fortunes have waxed and waned since then. The deal saddled the company with debt and attracted criticism from activist investor Carl Icahn. Buffett doubled down as Icahn exited, eventually buying up roughly 28% of its shares. The company’s shares more recently have come under pressure with oil prices lower.

Occidental has been selling noncore assets to raise cash to pay down debt. As of August, it said it had repaid $7.5 billion of debt. 

Berkshire, on the other hand, has been sitting on a massive cash pile. The company’s cash and Treasury bills sat at a record $344 billion at the end of June, raising investors’ eyebrows.

Buffett has said the company still prefers owning businesses, though has suggested that finding the right ones to buy can be hard. “Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned,” Buffett wrote earlier this year. 

The famed investor plans to retire from his role as CEO at the end of the year and hand the reins to Greg Abel. Buffett will remain chairman.",109,31,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nuojke/berkshire_hathaway_near_10_billion_deal_for/,new,Buffett,0.98
1nuntsi,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 16:11:46,The Dark side of Johnson and Johnson(J&J),"This post dives deep into the lawsuits filed on J&J, Thought it's common knowledge as an investor and analyst but then got to know that this common knowledge is not so common, So...Writing up this post. Did all the research myself and used PineAI from [PineGap.ai](http://PineGap.ai) to get better access to reports and  fillings (Hehe,Hard to not plug in as an analyst). This is not to defame anyone, Would love to know your views.  
  
Everyone knows Johnson & Johnson,household name for baby products,but it has a sinister side that is linked to the U.S. opioid epidemic.   
For long known as a gentle brand, J&J contributed to lethal epidemic. During 1990s J&J was aware of its fentanyl based opioid Duragesic which caused addictions but still promoted opioids as safe to treat chronic pain by targeting doctors and nursing facilities with communications that minimized risk.  
J&J had subsidaries like Noramco...Which were responsible for about 20–25% of raw materials like thebaine used in U.S. opioids back in the 2000s...which later led to a surge in prescriptions.   
It then contributed to an opioid crisis that has taken more than 700,000 lives since 1999 and provisional data frm CDC is estimating around 87,000 deaths in 2024.  
J&J dropped millions into patient advocacy groups,like the American pain foundation, to downplay the addiction risks and push against limits on prescriptions.   
Internal emails from 1998 even called these groups 'megaphone' and during testimony in 2021, executives tried to call this addiction as a societal issue. Societal Issue?Seriously?  
  
But then what were the consequences? J&J agreed to a $5 billion settlement in 2021 to resolve most opioid lawsuits. with payments over 9 years funding treatment and prevention. By 2024 states like Washington received their shares almost $149.5 million. Most of the thousands of lawsuits have settled, with only a few remaining in 2025.  
J&J explored controversial bankruptcy tactics like the Texas two step, to limit liabilities,though primarily for talc cases, not opioids. Their stock rose \~14% in 2025, though an unrelated talc lawsuit rejection in April caused a \~3% dip.Despite settlements, J&J’s role in the crisis profiting while addiction soared challenges its healer image.

I felt this might be a way to offset Sirius XM declining revenues.  I also liked the reduction in share count and dividend.  I thought if any of this came to pass the market might re rate them to a higher multiple.  The bit below is simply an AI overview of my original thoughts I think it summerized it much better than I ever could.  Are there any other holders who purchased with a similar view to potential future revenue streams for Sirius ?

As a side note, i would think that companies like Garmin will soon see their products like inreach become obsolete as more phones and other devices end up connected to a satellite network.

I'd like to share a list of companies that, based on my analysis, appear to be trading at a significant discount to their intrinsic value, offering a potential margin of safety. My approach is to find good businesses that are temporarily out of favor with the market.

I've focused on quantifiable metrics like P/B ratio, debt levels, and cash flow generation. Here are a few examples from the list that I believe fit the value investing framework:

* **Allos ($ALOS3 - Brazil):** A classic Graham-style play. The market is valuing this real estate company at approximately 50% of its asset value, and it operates with no long-term debt burdening its cash flow.
* **Barclays ($BCS - UK):** This bank is currently trading below its book value with a P/B of 0.81, despite a history of consistent and growing profits. Seems like a clear disconnect between price and value.
* **Global Payments ($GPN - US):** A wonderful company, in Buffett's terms, that has seen its price fall. Its strong financials and ability to generate cash remain intact, presenting what could be a compelling long-term opportunity.

I currently own these three stocks in my portfolio with equal-weight, 33% each.

First of all, I want to hear some advice about my first stock.

  
1. [Gambling.com](http://Gambling.com) (GAMB)

This company is rapidly growing with several M&As. It has a low valuation, although a temporary profit decline has pushed its PE ratio to 20, which seems high.

This company originally does performance marketing for online gambling sites worldwide. It stems from the growth of global online gambling industry. Before 2024, the company has done M&A to acquire influential domains. [https://www.rotowire.com](https://www.rotowire.com) is one of them.

By the way, in 2024, this company did M&A with Odds Holdings owning OddsJam which is the #1 platform for quantitative/mathmetical/calculative online gamblers. Revenue from this part increased by four times compared to last year.

The temporary profit decline is because of *SAFE(Simple Agreement for Future Equity*). It means that the greater performance Odds Holdings will show, the better rewards that components of Odds Holdings will get. Because Odds Holdings demonstrated better performance than it contracted, a cost was incurred for accounting purposes without any cash outflow. This also explains the seemingly low current ratio, which fell from above 1 to 0.59.

I think this stock price plunge is quite irrational. Because I strongly believe the profit will be improved from next quarter. My target price is around $23, up from the current $8.2. I am expecting 18% growth from the previous quarter and a PER of 18.",9,32,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nuh8ee/give_me_some_advice_i_tried_peter_lynch_approach/,new,Stock Analysis,0.91

I look at two things to verify this, the customer retention rate and the industry market share.

The customer churn meaning the average loss of customers has been 4%, considering the industry this is rather strong, and validates the high switching costs competitive advantage.

Secondly the market share, this tells us if they can retain af the very least and Secondly grow and capture more. The retained market share average over the last five years, (this includes FY25 anum earnings projected) is 5.4%, and has consistently grown year over year.

1nuaotq,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 07:31:48,Morio Denki 6647,"I bought another Japanese net-net for my portfolio. Here are the main characteristics:

* 4x Earnings
* 79% of NCAV
* 53% of TBV
* Recent repurchases

[https://cristianleon1200.substack.com/p/morio-denki-6647](https://cristianleon1200.substack.com/p/morio-denki-6647)

Morio Denki—TSE: 6647—is a tiny railway equipment manufacturer located in Tokyo, Japan. With a market cap of just ¥2.6 billion, or \~$17 million, it's the smallest company I’ve bought on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Here are a couple of examples of what they manufacture:

Similar to the previous Japanese companies I’ve shared, what I like about Morio Denki is its solid balance sheet, stable business, cheap valuation, and capital allocation improvement.

**Balance Sheet**

Unfortunately, most of this company’s current assets aren’t in cash, only 16%; even adding the marketable securities, you get that only 39% of the current assets are 100% liquid. The weakest line of Morio’s current assets, inventory, represents a modest 38%. While less than ideal, the fact that inventory represents a bigger portion of current assets than in other net-nets doesn’t make me discard 6647 right away, because the ratio of current assets to total liabilities is still >2, thus giving enough protection in case of liquidation. 

**Business**

Like many other small Japanese companies, Morio has been in business for over 100 years, having been founded in 1911. Over the last decade, revenue has been stable, oscillating between ¥7 and 10 billion, with no operating or net losses. The last 10-year average operating income is ¥369 million, and the net income is ¥232 million. This means the business has generated an average 5.6% return over ¥4.15 billion of average equity. While this is not great at all, at least the business is not losing money and can keep existing for the foreseeable future.

**Valuation**

Morio Denki is trading at 79% of its net current asset value and approximately 10 times normalized earnings. From a simple liquidation analysis, the business is clearly trading at a discount; you’re getting the current assets at a 21% discount with the machines and properties for free. If we say that the tangible assets can generate close to a 6% return, and the business can be purchased at half of the net tangible assets, you are getting an 11-12% return on your investment. Even if this hypothetical return never occurs, and the company needs to be liquidated, buying at a deep enough discount, we are unlikely to lose money.

**Capital Allocation**

Morio Denki has adopted new policies to improve capital returns and the price-to-book ratio. In 2024, the company repurchased 2.1% of the shares outstanding. This year so far, they’ve repurchased 1.5%. While these numbers are not anywhere close to those of other aggressive repurchasers, it's adding value to remaining shareholders. In their recent press release, “Measures to achieve management that takes capital costs and stock prices into consideration,” they stated that their objective is to make the stock price closer to 1x book value. And these repurchases are the first step.

A more effective way to improve the price-to-book ratio in Japan is to increase the dividend payout ratio by announcing a 30-50% dividend payout ratio, or a dividend on equity policy. In the last decade, the dividend per share has oscillated between ¥30 and ¥60 per share; by adopting a 40% payout ratio, the business would pay around ¥80-90 per share, bringing more predictable returns for investors. 

While they haven’t adopted a set dividend payout ratio or a dividend on equity policy, they check out another variable that I look for in Japanese net-nets: tangible book value per share growth.

Tangible book value per share has compounded at 5.6% in the last decade, which is not terrible considering they’ve paid decent dividends over time. In the 2025 bar, there is a 12% growth with respect to the previous year; this higher growth is due in part to good business performance, but also due to share repurchases at ½ of TBV. In August, they repurchased an extra 21k shares, or 1.5%, at \~50% of TBV. This is clearly accretive to shareholder wealth and will boost TBV/share growth. TBV/share growth shows that the business is not burning away the shareholders’ capital and is actually compounding it over time.  

**How might this investment go wrong?**

1. I do not have any special insight into the business. I do not know if management are crooks or if the business will become obsolete.
2. No further shareholder returns are conducted. The company might not conduct further share repurchases; not returning capital in Japan will likely make the stock a value trap.
3. In the past, the company has implemented measures against large share purchases by other entities. This might mean that they are reluctant to be acquired, which might block a rapid return of capital.

Trading below 80% of NCAV and ½ of tangible book value, while repurchasing shares, Morio Denki 6647 has a low downside with potential satisfactory return in my basket of Japanese net-nets.

Long Morio Denki 6647.

Do you think the UNP/NSC merger will be value accretive, or are you worried about the price (as a UNP shareholder) and the additional debt of the combined entity?

Railroads have been by far my worse performing investment. I predicted more industrial integration between US, Canada and Mexico and an increase in trade, but boy was I wrong. In addition, I think the economic landscape is shifting to less higher quality products and software, so the volume of goods transported might increase at a slower pace than it has in the last decade (think cars sales for example). Also Business to consumer has lower margins and higher costs.

Still railroads have their infrastructure in place, are clearly cashflow positive, and pay a small dividend every year and buy back a few shares every quarter, so I don’t think they will lose lots of money long term.

Honestly, I am not a fan of NCS reliance on coal (although this administration doesn’t hate the product), and I am a bit concerned of the additional debt taken over by UNP, as well as the 27% share dilution.

However, the management is unlikely to bankrupt such a profitable company, and I can only see advantages owning such a big chunk of US commercial rail long term, at least for shareholders with a massive time horizon.

Given the whole stock market bubble debate, I think the safe haven assets like precious metals are looking pretty attractive right now.

Sadly I don’t have 6 figures to start dabbling in the futures market but I found the SPDR Gold Trust ETF which looks a bit more in my price range.

1nu7d38,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 04:05:43,Thoughts on Boyd Gaming (the other BYD),"Literally has all the good things you want to see in a company.

- Year over year growth in revenue and gross profit 
- Share buybacks over the last few years
- Margins like a tech company
- Valuation like Lululemon / Paypal

### So what do they do?

Boyd Gaming Corporation primarily operates casinos and gaming entertainment facilities. Their customers are largely local residents from the areas surrounding their properties, as well as tourists visiting those regions. Demographically, they attract a broad range of adults, with a focus on those who enjoy gaming, dining, and entertainment. The company's revenue comes mainly from gaming operations (slot machines and table games), followed by food and beverage sales, hotel stays, and other entertainment offerings.

So the revenue distribution is 70% casinos, 8% food & drinks, 5% hotel, 11% online gambling, and the rest is just random things like ATM concession, retail, convention, etc.

Midwest & South USA makes up 55%, Las Vegas strip 6%, Las Vegas locals 24%, and rest is online.

### What makes them different?

Boyd Gaming targets a specific customer segment: gaming enthusiasts with tighter budgets, primarily in regional markets, rather than competing directly with high-end resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. This allows them to dominate niche markets and cater to local preferences. So this makes them harder to displace and they are less centralized.

Loyalty programs create sticky customers. Furthermore, Boyd is strategically expanding its online gaming presence, which diversifies revenue streams and reaches a broader customer base.

### Why invest?

Consistently beats EPS and revenue estimates. Returns money to shareholders. Operational efficiency. Solid history of outperformance. Manageable debt. PE of 13ish.

I already have a large slug of my portfolio in cash/mmf (30% a la Buffett). 50% in a global ETF. 20% in US small caps (s&p600). 

As I continue to dripfeed more in and this bull run continues id really like to pivot my portfolio gradually into resilient stocks. Thus giving me even more dry powder to buy quality stocks at better prices when/if market turns. 

Right now it's easy to find quality, but they're all more than 25x forward earnings and im not keen to pay it. The trouble I'm finding is that the classic recommendations like Walmart are already really pricey... and I believe would also tumble during a correction/ crash. 

Are there any equities out there that i could park my money in to suit the following criteria:

1. 7%+ total return
2. Would not fall much (or at all) during a downturn. I'm thinking that probably requires a moderate or low forward pe

1ntyl2h,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 20:15:36,Nordson is Proving That Old Dogs Can Still Learn New Tricks,"**Actionable Insight:**

Nordson has been around over 70 years and quietly increasing their dividend for 61 of them. The company has built its moat and riches by exploiting the niches. The company earns a high ROIC and in the last 15 years has been quietly making acquisitive moves towards growth and diversifying away from cyclical industries. If this low beta company can continue to execute within guidance and realize their growth targets then current \~18x EV/EBITDA seems overly modest and could rerate closer to peer Graco at \~20x for a price target of $310

**Intro:**

When I think about whether a company is going to be a good investment a few things come to mind, but the very first thing is will this company be here in 10 years. That's what I like about Nordson, this company has been around for awhile and I would wager it will continue to be. This is not a moon shot company, its a quiet compounder that will continue to generate cash flow in the background.

However, unlike a typical bond proxy this behemoth of a company is still taking swings for the fences. And given its track record, when the company swings its worth paying attention too. With an average EBITDA of around 30% and a ROIC hovering above 12% growth is the best path for success. Thankfully for the investors, management agrees.

**A Little About Nordson:**

For decades the company has played the part of the quiet cyclical compounder. Founded in 1954 on airless spray patents, it built its reputation in Industrial Precision Solutions, the hidden workhorses of packaging and coatings. Anything but sexy, this company was quietly sealing cereal boxes, coating electronics, and adding polymers with microscopic accuracy.

By 2010, revenue topped $1 Billion. Soon after, Nordson expanded into the high growth segment of Medical & Fluid Solutions with acquisitions in medical tubing and connectors. Some years go by and the company diversifies further into Advanced Technology Solutions through electronics and semiconductor dispensing.

**The New CEO:**

In 2019 a bold new character enters the scene: CEO Sundaram ""Naga"" Nagarajan. What he brought with him: An Ascend strategy focusing on 6-8% growth, 10-12% EPS growth, and the operating discipline of the NBS Next Framework. The message was subtle but clear: Nordson wasnt just defending its crown, but its looking to expand.

Immediately Naga's tenure would be tested by fire. The Covid pandemic would soon take the world by surprise. Factories slowed, polymers slumped, supply chains buckled. Where others struggled, Nordson's armor -> 57% of revenue from consumables, held firm. Margins barely dipped, proving its aristocratic steadiness. Emboldened by the trial, the CEO dared to reach further.

**Semiconductors Anyone?**

Im August 2022 Nordson stunned its own playbook, paying $380M for CyberOptics, a semiconductor inspection firm just a tenth its size. The company paid 4x revenue and 20x EBITDA. For a conservative acquirer this was audacious. The bet: that ""dispense + inspect"" would give Nordson a seat at the semiconductor packaging table, where chiplets, AI, and EV batteries demand perfect precision. The trade off: Lower segment margines of 24% but a real taste of secular growth.

**Can you pass me the medical valves please?**

Then came Atrion in 2024. $800M for medical valves and fluid components. Boring, high-margin, indispensable. Hospitals don't cycle with GDP; aging populations and a growing demand for minimally invasive procedures keep demand steady. If CyberOptics was the growth swing, Atrion was the ballast. Together goodwill swelled from $1.8B to $2.8B but redefined Nordson's portfolio: semis for upside, medtech for stabilization.

**So why pick Nordson?**

Here's where the narrative sharpens. Nordson's peers: Graco, IDEX, Donaldson, ITW... all remain incrementalists. They bolt on adjacencies, protect margins, return cash. Solid, but unsurprising.  Nordson stands alone in deliberately trying to transform from ""mature aristocrat"" into a ""growth compounder."" This is the crux of the reason I believe Nordson should be trading a higher multiple relative to peers.

**The Big List of If's**

Today Nordson trades at \~17-18x EV/EBITDA. This places it pricier than IDEX and Donaldson (\~15x) but less than Graco (\~20x). If CyberOptics sustains double-digit growth, if Atrion proves its ballast, if NBS Next unlocks the promised 10-12% EPS growth, Nordson has a path to the peer high end: 19-20x, $275-310 pps. That leaves 15-25% upside, not from financial engineering but from a deliberate evolution.

**What I am worried about:**

This is a low beta play. Even in a bear case I am not overly concerned about drawdowns or whether or not this company will continue to pay dividends. In my estimation, a bear case leaves the largest cost being missed opportunity elsewhere.

Semiconductors are arguably near peak cycle and would whiplash anytime, or could continue to run for a few years. The global exposure of the company helps to diversify income streams, but it also subjects the investor to fx risks, And the company has taken on a lot of goodwill, any signs that the investments are not paying off and there is a real risk that will have to be written down and can negatively effect the earnings in the future. Even though to date in the companies 70+ years this has not happened, the past is not a reflection of future performance.

The company does have some defense against these risks. A strong balance sheet, strong cash flow, moderate leverage and a consumanbles-driven model give it protection peers envy.

**Bottom Line:**

Nordson has a very compelling narrative. Its not just a good company at a fair price. Its the only aristocrat in its class deliberately reaching for more. Risking reputation and margine comfort to earn growth optionality. It feels like a founder ran company. If it succeeds, investors wont just own a quiet compounder. Theyll own an aristocrat that has evolved.

I work as a scientist for a large US tech company where management tries to enforce AI. But literally nobody uses AI tools. Or should I say, nobody has become more productive with existing tools. It takes more time to correct codes generated than writing from scratch or leveraging existing codes. It does help here and there, but NOTHING disruptive. I save maybe 3h of work per week, and I am being super generous. Not even talking about the infinite revenue loop created between the main AI actors. Time reveals everything, and this is no exception.

Now, there have been several posts on '*where to invest today? what are your strong picks in a period of ATH?*' So writing here where I have invested a large portion of my value portfolio, waiting patiently that money flows back. 

  
Here it is: **US insurance providers**. I have USD 110k invested as of today. Why? PE lower than usual, high revenue growth and money likely rotated from the sector to stupid AI. I have collected the best ones (according to me) such that you do not have to. 

Criteria: low PE (and lower than usual), high and consistent revenue growth, profitable, growing or constant margins, continuous stock price increase with a decrease in the last year (so not ATH), large cap:

* Chubb
* PGR
* ACGL
* AJG (okay PE is does not match the criteria above, but it systematicall increases over time with performance, so still invested in)
* Optional: TRV
* UNH
* ELV

**High risk (not fitting the above criteria, but could go to the moon):**

* LMND
* ROOT

Cherry on the cake: such portfolio has outperformed the SP500 in the last decade while being less affected during downturn periods. Insurance is not going anywhere, it is a necessity that grows with demographics and increased frequency of large events. Sector has underperformed but money will come back.

For a given company; Google, Oracle, Nvidia, whatever when analysis is performed, whether it be discounted cash flows, assets vs. liab, etc. - when you come to a value all else equal, and 7% inflation for the prior year, would that company not start with a value of 107% of its prior year valuation? Is it standard practice to then multiply that by 1.07 to get estimated dollar value? As the company you are evaluating is an asset, that is being valued in a currency that is worth less than it was in a prior year.

1ntmgdl,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 12:20:13,DoorDash vs Delivery Hero,"Hi!

I'm wondering about market capitalization of 2 very similar companies DoorDash vs Delivery Hero.

A couple of statistics

**DoorDash:**

*Market cap: 115 B USD*

*Revenue H1 2025: 6,3 B USD (22,8% Y/Y growth)*

*EBITA: 1,25 B USD*

*EBITA margin: 2,7%*

**Delivery Hero:**

*Market cap: 8,5 B USD*

*Revenue H1 2025:* 8,5 *B USD (24,2% Y/Y growth)*

*EBITA: 0,48 B USD*

*EBITA margin: 1,7%*

Both companies look quite similar and seem to be at a comparable stage of development. Delivery Hero is even growing slightly faster (24.2% vs. 22.8%), despite being the larger company.  
However, DoorDash’s market capitalization is 13.5 times higher. Is this mainly due to the difference in stock market listing, or am I missing something? I could understand a U.S. company being valued two to three times higher, but a 13.5x gap feels extreme.",2,0,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ntmgdl/doordash_vs_delivery_hero/,new,Question / Help,1.0
1ntma2e,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 12:13:37,Help set up my mom for retirement,"Hi, 

My mom retirement fund is 1.1m, she worked hard to make that money and now she's not sure what to do with it. Vast majority of the money came from real estate over 30 years. 

I am not an experienced investor, but I understand that  diversification helps and timing the market is almost impossible. So through meeting with CFPs and CFAs, doing my own research I have suggested the following: 

10% (~100k) in physical gold
25% (~250k) in flex GIC returning 5.8%
75% (~750k) in the equities (650k in diversified ETFs and 100k in individual stocks).

The basis for putting 35% outside the market is to protect her for at least 3-4 years of income in case the market crashes. She needs ~100k per year, she doesn't own a property and she helps my sister go through university.

My questions:
1. What do you think of the approach, any critiques? 
2. Where would you invest the 100k in individual stocks? I think rare earths will grow significantly in the US, and then some defensive positions like UNH and LULU (high cf, good pe compared to industry). 

Again, this is all based on my readings, talking to ""experts"" and my research. None of this is based on experience, I only made money through crypto which is highly volatile (or used to, but that's a high risk for my mom IMO).

Off-brands / knockouts / counterfeit have been common since day 1, but they're all referred to as ""Crocs"" (just like ""Band-Aid""). When someone wants to buy Crocs-like shoes, they'll go to Amazon and search ""Crocs"" and buy whatever come up, which will usually be real Crocs. This is why they maintain a very high gross margin selling a easy-to-make product.
2. Low capex and high ROE. They don't manufacture the shoes, they outsource from China and Vietnam. If necessary, they can easily switch to Mexico or India etc, because it's low tech. Again the moat is the name, not the tech.
3. After you buy the shoes, they always work well, the product is simple, no way to mess it up (have defects etc). For people who like those shoes, they know the last purchase worked well and the next purchase will work well again, so they keep buying more, maybe for a lifetime.
4. Share price dropped 30% in a day after last quarterly report, because they lowered the earning forecast due to ""uncertain tariff environment in the US"", but I think it's not an issue - it doesn't change the demand, and all competitors are equally affected. I think it's an opportunity to buy. Some insiders bought it too at that time.
5. They now have a 20 PE because last quarter there was a huge impairment of goodwill (they overpaid to acquire another brand which performed poorly) so GAAP earning were low. If you screen by PE, you won't find this stock, which I think is why nobody is buying the dip. But if you read the last quarterly report, their non-GAAP earnings was much higher, the real PE is less than 7.
6. I personally observed that some kids nowadays call slides ""Crocs"" too, maybe because they grew up in a household where the parents wear Crocs indoors and don't wear slides, and they call them Crocs, so the kid grew up thinking all indoor shoes are called Crocs.

I'm in the process of rebuilding my Small-Cap portfolio (it's a portfolio that benefits from a tax advantage), and I absolutely don't know what to take. In fact, I had bet quite a lot on a company that just crashed on the stock market due to excellent results that weren't enough for the investors, and all that with a nice capital increase that represents more than 12% of the capital.

The main issue is no etf is available. There are some available ""fund"" for this type of portfolio, but they can't beat the market, and much worse ...

I did have my watchlist, but once again I missed everything: Theon International and Fincantieri have exploded because coincidentally the defense sector is rising again (similar to Hensoldt...). I had AVIO, but because I wanted to make an effort for a rigorous analysis, I sold it, and the stock naturally took off (24 hours after the sale, while the stock was stuck at 32 Euros despite good news).

Today I'm trying to find good Small Caps in full momentum again, but I find absolutely nothing. Unfortunately, the German market doesn't fit into the portfolio because it's outside of Euronext. So I have to find some on the stock markets: **French, Dutch, Irish, Belgian, Italian, and Norwegian...**

1ntjrmr,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 10:38:46,Canadian National Railway(CNI): A Buffett-Style Compounder hiding in plain Sight?,"So, before we get into this. I analyse businesses for a living, What I post is not necessarily stocks related...But great businesses that will fundamentally will make you good bucks in the stock market  
Keep in mind...it's not a stock advice:

When great long term compounders are mentioned, railroads do not come to mind for many people. Warren Buffett famously bought Burlington Northern (BNSF), calling it an ""all-in wager on the economic future of the United States"". If you dig in the space, Canadian National Railway (CNI) is possibly the most ignored example today.

\-Why Are Railroads Great Businesses?

\-Natural monopolies: The capital cost, regulation, and land rights needed to replicate a rail network almost makes it impossible for more players to enter. Rail roads are almost by design oligopolies.  
\-Pricing power and efficiency: Rail is the cheapest and most energy efficient mode of transport for freight over long distances. This will keep them viable businesses even if we live in a world that is obsessed with tech.  
\-Inflation hedge: Many contracts have fuel surcharges and inflation pass through, this protects margins for decades.

Why CNI?  
Canadian National is unique: with a single rail line, it has more reach than any North American railroad - Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. The geographic footprint generates strategic advantages that no other Class I railroads can duplicate.

\-Diversified freight mix: Grain, petroleum, intermodal, forestry products, nothing particular dominates revenue.  
\-Operating discipline: CNI is widely regarded as one of the most efficient operators in the industry, with industry-leading operating ratios.  
\-Cross-border trade exposure: As U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade flows increase, CNI sits in a structurally advantaged position.

Capital Allocation & Durability

\-Strong free cash flow that supports dividends+buybacks without jeopardizing reinvestment.  
\-Enormous reinvestment moat: every dollar spent on track upgrades, locomotives, and technology widens the gap competitors would need billions to close.  
\-Net Revenue hitting- 4,272M which is a bit higher side for this industry.  
\-Long runway: freight rail is not going away;it remains a backbone of continental logistics.

This sector involves high R&D and requires capital, but the overall market opportunity is large, potentially reaching tens of billions of dollars by 2030.

Currently, the central competitive advantage isn't just the core technology (which often relies on shared platforms like NVIDIA) but regulatory compliance and geographic scale.

The Thesis: The most defensible moat over the next five years will belong to the companies that successfully secure Level 4 permits across varied global jurisdictions (e.g., the US, China, and the Middle East). Why? Because there's a system (weride) validated and approved by transportation authorities in distinct regulatory environments has a significant advantage over a single-market operator. Gaining these approvals requires substantial resource commitment, which functions as a strong barrier to entry.

This perspective suggests that when evaluating these companies, we should prioritize two key intangible assets: regulatory asset accumulation and geographic first-mover status, as these will underpin future business operations.

1ntimc1,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 09:53:06,"Deckers (DECK): 52% Drop, 104% Upside? A DCF Case Study","Deckers (DECK) has fallen 52% from its January 2025 high of $223.98 to $105.77, even though the company just reported record revenue and earnings. The market seems focused on tariff risks, weaker guidance, and slowing growth in both UGG and Hoka, which made it an interesting test case for a disciplined DCF analysis.

Data from our platform, using analyst consensus forecasts, points to an initial 12.4% growth rate derived through weighted regression across estimates. Growth is then tapered gradually to 3% over a ten-year horizon, which avoids the unrealistic cliff effect of traditional two-stage models. The model applies a 22.3% EBITDA margin, consistent with DECK’s historical efficiency and pricing power. For the discount rate, it incorporates Damodaran’s methodology, starting with an unlevered industry beta and relevering it for DECK’s capital structure. This results in a WACC of 7.2%, reflecting current market risk premiums.

On those assumptions, the model generated $31.3 billion in enterprise value, with 71% coming from terminal value and the rest from projected cash flows. After adjusting for net cash, that translated to an equity value of $32.9 billion, or $215.8 per share. Compared with the current price, the implied upside is about 104%. Sensitivity testing shows that even with more conservative 8% growth assumptions, the upside remains around 66%. On the other hand, raising the discount rate above 10% would nearly erase the gap, which shows how sensitive the valuation is to risk assumptions.

The analysis highlights both the opportunity and the limitations of DCF. On one hand, the market seems to be pricing DECK at barely half of what a consensus-driven model suggests. On the other hand, more than 70% of the value comes from terminal assumptions, which leaves a lot riding on long-term execution and competitive dynamics. Add in the uncertainties of tariffs and geopolitics, and it’s easy to see why sentiment has pushed the stock down.

DCF suggests the market may be underpricing DECK’s fundamentals, but the result rests on assumptions about long-term growth durability and risk premiums. To me, it’s less a “back up the truck” case and more an example of how sentiment-driven dislocations can create opportunities if you’re comfortable with the embedded risks.

Would be interested to hear how others in this community would approach DECK. Does it look like an attractive value setup, or a potential trap disguised by optimistic assumptions?

1ntah2s,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 02:07:00,Environmentally friendly Bitcoin miner pivoting towards data centre infrastructure - TeraWulf Inc.,"What happens when one of the greenest Bitcoin miners also becomes a data center player? You get TeraWulf—a company tapping into nuclear and hydro power to mine Bitcoin while simultaneously scaling the infrastructure needed for the AI and cloud economy. It’s a dual strategy that could give them an edge in two of the fastest-growing industries on the planet.

Settle in—this is where I break down exactly what TeraWulf is doing and why it matters. The way TeraWulf is positioning itself might surprise you.

As always, this is not financial advice, just a way for me to kill time lol.

The first rule of investing in any company is simple: know what they do and how they make money for shareholders.

# Overview

TeraWulf operates as an owner and operator of vertically integrated, industrial-scale digital infrastructure across the United States. The core strategy emphasizes environmentally sustainable operations, utilizing predominantly zero-carbon energy sources. This vertical integration, coupled with management’s deep expertise in the energy infrastructure sector—spanning decades in development, ownership, and operation of large-scale energy assets —provides a foundational competitive advantage in securing and delivering reliable, compliant power to highly demanding computation clients. The business model is rapidly evolving from a singular focus on proprietary computing (Bitcoin mining) to a dual-segment approach, incorporating high-margin, long-term hosting.

# Segment A: Bitcoin Self-Mining

This segment is defined by high volume and high volatility. As of December 2024, WULF achieved 9.7 EH/s of installed self-mining capacity, representing a significant 94.0% year-over-year increase. This scale exposes WULF directly to Bitcoin price fluctuations and network difficulty adjustments, reinforcing the stock’s high historical volatility (Beta 4.18).

Operationally, the self-mining segment faces structural cost challenges. In December 2024, the average power cost was approximately $0.078/kWh, leading to a high average power cost of $62,805 per bitcoin mined (excluding credits from demand response). This cost structure is considerably higher than that of peers who rely on subsidized or less sustainable power sources (as detailed . The premium paid for sustainable energy is not an operational flaw if it is the enabling factor for the high-margin HPC business. The mining segment essentially functions as the anchor load and operational proof-of-concept for the green energy infrastructure, allowing the company to charge a premium in the high-value contracted segment, which ultimately outweighs the higher energy cost in the mining segment.

# Segment B: HPC Hosting

This segment represents the future of WULF’s business, it involves leveraging the company’s vertically integrated infrastructure to provide compute-ready data center space for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI clients.

The quality of revenue is exceptionally high due to recent contract wins:

1. **Core42:** Secured for over 70 MW of digital infrastructure, representing total revenue exceeding $1 billion over an initial 10-year term.
2. **Fluidstack/Google:** Anchor agreements for 360+ MW of critical IT load, representing approximately $6.7 billion in contracted revenue over the initial 10-year term.

The lease with Fluidstack is expected to bring in over $670 million a year in revenue with site level net operating margins of roughly 85%. Importantly, Google is providing a $3.2 billion backstop for FluidStacks lease obligations in exchange for warrants representing about 14% of WULF’s equity, an extraordinary vote of confidence from one of the most influential players in AI.

Secondly, they brought in Cayuga. They executed an 80 year ground lease with a purchase option, securing exclusive rights to develop up to 400 MWs of digital infrastructure on a fully equipped site with high capacity transmission, industrial water intake and redundant fiber. It is expected to bring more than 130 megawatts online in 2027 with substantial expansion potential beyond that.

Together, these transactions increase the total platform capacity to over 1 GW, firmly positioning Lake Mariner and Cayuga as cornerstone assets for the future of AI infrastructure.

# BTC Mining Market Dynamics

The legacy cryptocurrency mining equipment market remains relatively small, valued at $4.89 billion in 2024, with a modest expected CAGR of 6% through 2029. This limited total addressable market confirms that WULF’s future valuation cannot be sustained or driven by the mining segment alone. Furthermore, the high power cost structure ($0.078/kWh) exacerbates the sensitivity of WULF’s self-mining operations to post-Halving reductions in block rewards and transaction fee volatility. To maintain viability in this segment, WULF must rely on continuous operational efficiency improvements, such as its currently superior fleet efficiency of 19.2 J/TH.

WULF’s positioning requires a nuanced competitive comparison, as it no longer competes solely against pure-play miners. In the mining segment, WULF is structurally disadvantaged on cost when compared to peers who operate in markets with highly subsidized power or robust demand response programs.

While peers like Riot Platforms focus on maximizing scale and energy credits in deregulated markets (achieving a low all-in power cost of 2.8c/kWh ), WULF’s focus is on vertical integration and securing premium HPC contracts. This strategic dichotomy provides WULF with a valuable competitive exit strategy: as HPC capacity expands (200+ MW by YE 2026) , the company can strategically phase out its lower-margin self-mining IT load, replacing volatile commodity revenue with high-margin contracted infrastructure revenue.

# HPC and AI Infrastructure Market

The demand trajectory for HPC and AI infrastructure is vastly steeper than that of the legacy cryptocurrency mining market. WULF’s commitment to sustainable, zero-carbon energy serves as a critical competitive differentiator, allowing them to capture the “Green Premium” required by hyperscale clients seeking to meet stringent ESG and compliance mandates.

The Google-backed Fluidstack transaction provides definitive external validation of WULF’s infrastructure quality. Google, as a hyper-scale cloud provider known for rigorous technical and financial due diligence, backstopping $3.2 billion of Fluidstack’s lease obligations is a powerful endorsement. This commitment confirms that WULF possesses the necessary engineering expertise and reliable power infrastructure to support the complex, demanding compute environment required for cutting-edge AI computation, justifying the targeted 85% NOI margins.

# Moat Durability Assessment

**Moat Component:** Vertical Integration & Energy Expertise

**Assessment:** Durable

**Rationale:** Management’s deep expertise in energy infrastructure allows WULF to design and build bespoke power assets ($8M-$10M/MW CAPEX) that pure-play miners or generic data center operators cannot easily replicate.

**Moat Component:** Contracted Cash Flow Quality

**Assessment:** Highly Durable

**Rationale:** Long-term, non-cancellable 10-year contracts with annual escalators provide predictable, high-margin revenue, insulating WULF from commodity volatility. The Google backstop adds superior credit quality to this revenue stream.

**Moat Component:** Location and Power Sourcing

**Assessment:** Moderate

**Rationale:** Securing rights to low-cost, zero-carbon power in key industrial locations like Lake Mariner (NY) is geographically restricted and acts as a significant barrier to entry once established.

# Growth Analysis

The foundation of future growth is the certainty provided by the contracted revenue. The $6.7 billion commitment over 10 years offers revenue visibility unparalleled among cryptocurrency mining peers. This annuity stream, backed by the credit quality of a hyperscale partner, is projected to yield approximately $570 million in annual Site NOI at the 85% margin target once the 360+ MW is fully online (expected year-end 2026).

The growth trajectory is dictated by three primary levers:

1. **HPC Deployment Acceleration (Primary Lever):** The successful and timely completion of the 360+ MW buildout by year-end 2026 is paramount. Success in meeting this ambitious timeline ensures immediate realization of the 85% NOI margin and justifies the transition to a higher infrastructure valuation multiple.
2. **Expansion Optionality (CB-5):** Fluidstack’s exclusivity on an additional 160 MW at Lake Mariner represents a significant, low-risk growth path. This opportunity converts physical site infrastructure and utility access rights into high-margin capacity without the immediate burden of high-cost land or site development. Monetizing this growth inventory would nearly double the company’s core contracted MW capacity.
3. **Optimization of BTC Mining Operations (Secondary Lever):** Continuous optimization efforts to reduce the currently high effective power cost ($0.078/kWh) —potentially through more favorable Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) or enhanced demand response participation—would increase cash flow in the secondary segment, providing residual liquidity for maintenance CAPEX or accelerated debt service.

# Risk Analysis

WULF remains susceptible to external financial shocks. The stock’s high historical Beta of 4.18 means market sentiment remains heavily influenced by Bitcoin price volatility until the contracted revenue fully dominates the financial profile (post-2027). Although the Google backstop secures the majority of the HPC financing, WULF must still access the capital markets to fund residual CAPEX, working capital, and potential future expansion capacity beyond the current contracts. Macroeconomic risks, including interest rate fluctuations and general regulatory changes in the digital asset space, persist.

The single most significant threat to the acquisition value is execution failure. The requirement to deploy $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion in CAPEX and bring 360+ MW online by year-end 2026 represents an aggressive operational timeline. Delays or significant cost overruns could breach contractual obligations and severely erode the projected 85% NOI margin. Furthermore, sourcing specialized components for HPC infrastructure at this scale introduces supply chain and logistical risks, although management’s energy infrastructure track record provides substantial mitigation.

It must be noted that while the initial debt load will be high the highly predictable $570 million in annual NOI ensures an exceptionally rapid de-leveraging timeline. This characteristic fundamentally lowers the credit risk associated with the high capital investment, making the resultant capital structure considerably safer than traditional Bitcoin mining debt.

# Financials

In the 2025, WULF self mined 485 Bitcoin at Lake Mariner or approximately 5 Bitcoin per day, a 30% increase over the 372 Bitcoin mined in Q1 2025. TheirGAAP revenues were up 38% quarter over quarter at $47.6 million in Q2 2025 from $34.4 million in Q1 2025. Meanwhile their GAAP cost of revenue exclusive of depreciation decreased by 10% from $24.5 million in Q1 2025 to $22.1 million in Q2 2025.

Power prices in Upstate New York normalized in Q2 2025 and they expect pricing to remain in line with historical levels for the rest of 2025 guiding at $0.05 per kilowatt hour for second half of the year. SG&A expense for Q2 2025 was $14.3 million after adjusting for stock based compensation SG&A decreased QoQ from $11.5 million in Q1 2025 to $10.7 million in Q2 2025. Their non GAAP adjusted EBITDA showed significant improvement in Q2 2025 totaling $14.5 million up from a negative $4.7 million in Q1 2025. As a reminder, these results are inclusive of significant increases in SG&A and operating expenses over the past twelve months as they invested heavily in the HPC business. These incremental costs have been entirely borne by the mining business until now.

WULF is on track for the Wolf Den and CB1 leases with Core42 to start generating revenue in Q3 2025. They remain on schedule and on budget for the delivery of this capacity. Looking ahead to the 2025, they’ve updated their guidance in on the investor presentations. At current BTC prices and network hash rate, they expect the mining operations to contribute positively to EBITDA in the second half of the year. They’ve also slightly adjusted the annual SG&A guidance to $50 - $55 million from $40 - $45 million reflecting the accelerated growth in theHPC business.

WULF is planning to raise $3 billion in debt for the expansion of its’ AI infrastructure. The CEO is working with Morgan Stanley to arrange the funding. This could be launched as early as next month thorugh high yield bonds or leveraged loans.",0,0,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ntah2s/environmentally_friendly_bitcoin_miner_pivoting/,new,Stock Analysis,0.25

1nt1y65,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 18:43:21,CATERPILLAR [Post 2/4],"*This is the second post of a serie of at least 4 posts on mining/construction equipment. The first post was on* [*Epiroc*](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ni0qk3/epiroc_swedish_mining_equipment_serial_acquirer/) 

Caterpillar is a manufacturer of mining equipment, construction equipment, gaz turbines and marine & rail equipment. It was founded in 1925.

  
The company sales are geographically diversified, eventhough the majority of them are made in north america.

**Asset Allocation**

In average the company distributes 35% of its earnings as dividends. 

In the last 6 years, the company used close to 60% of its earnings in net buybacks. The reduction of outstanging shares was about 3% per year during that period.

The equity ratio is about 20% in average.

The company made acquisitions over the years. Most of the acquisitions are now made in the Energy & Transportation Group. 

\* They bought lots of add-ons to their Rail Division (Progress Rail), originally bought in 2006.

\* They bought gaz-engine manufacturer MVM in 2011 for 774 M$

\* One add-on for Solar Turbines in 2015.



The last acquisitions outside that group are :

\* Bucyrus for 8.8 B$ in 2011. Most of the distribution businesses for Bucyrus have been resold to existing Caterpillar distributor in 2012-2014 for a total of more than 2 B$.

\* one Japanese distributor for 200 M$ in 2012

\* one chinese company bought for 677 M$ in 2012. The next year, they depreciated 580 M$ of goodwill, because of fake accounting numbers produced before the acquisitions !?! They signed a deal to get 135 M$ back from the guilty parties

  
**Shareholders, Management & Board**

The company doesn't have main shareholders.

The new CEO Joe Creed was named in may 2025, but has been in the group since 1997. He was named CFO of the largest group (Energy & Transportation) in 2013. He then managed the financial services division in addition to interim CFO of Caterpillar. He then managed two divisions of the Energy & Transportation Group. He was named group president of Energy & Transportation in 2021, then COO (as in : successor of the CEO) in 2023. 

Ex-CEO Jim Umleby (17-25) stayed as chairman. 

Jason Kaiser, successor as group president of Energy & Transportation has been in the group since 2000. 

Bob de Lange, group president Digital, Technology & Distribution has been in his position since 2018 and joined Caterpillar in 1993.

Toni Fassino, group president Construction Industries has been named in 2021, but joined the group in 1996. He was previously head of the Building Construction Products Division (part of the Construction Industries group) from 2018.

Denise Johnson has been named group president of Ressources industries in 2016. She works for Caterpillar since 2011.

Generally speaking, there is some continuity in the management and the board. I see it as a green flag.



**Some numbers**

The profitability is going up, but have been low sometimes. The company made losses in 2016. Then the profitability was : 1.66% (17), 11.23% (18), 11.33% (19), 7.18% (20%), 12.73% (21), 11.28% (22), 15.41% (23), 16.65% (24). 

We can see that the company is quite cyclical. They don't seem to have as much recurring revenues as Epiroc.

The problem is that the company is generating sales and revenues of financial products that are only equivalent to about 70% of their balance sheet. They don't make a lot of money on the total assets, except in 2023-2024. One small factor might be that their rental activities includes a lot of equipment that is not from the group, including for example compressors from Atlas Copco. Usually, owning equipment to rent is a bad business, especially if it is not your products.  


**Conclusion**

The company has definitely not been exceptionally good before 2023, especially if you compare with Epiroc. I would not buy it, unless they were able to keep their numbers as good as 2023-2024, which I doubt they can. Their high level of buybacks could destroy value rapidly if the price was more expensive. Behind this high level of dividend and buybacks hides a limited capacity to make acquisitions.",5,1,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nt1y65/caterpillar_post_24/,new,Stock Analysis,1.0

Nvda and googl together make up 84% of my portfolio. 

I was thinking to rotate into:
1. KSPI - fintech company with crazy ROE and operating margin that grows revenhe 15-20% a year, pays a huge dividend and also this year acquired business in Turkey and aggressively expanding there. Currently trading at 8 PE, PEG 0.28 

2. CDLR - construction company that focuses on offshore wind turbines. Company has 2.5 Billion euros of backlog contracts signed. Trading at 6.98 PE, PEG 0.07 (how is that even possible?)

3. KAP.IL - largest uranium extractor, with lowest uranium extraction cost. They are going through company restructuring and trading at PE of 11. Pays huge dividend as well. 

4. BN - just because this looks like a very diversified bet in one stock. PE is craz
crazy high but only because of the complex hierarchical structure of the corporation.

I think that a clear combination of both is crucial when analyzing securities. I think the quantitative side is more on the price you buy at, no matter how poor of value, if bought at the right price can return value, just has to be bought at the right price, like Howard Marks has continuously mentioned in his memo. Quantitative memos such as the P/E and P/B ratios, and of course, the DCF related to the intrinsic value, I like to have three different sets of growth, from a bear, to moderate, to a bull. 

The qualitative side helps when judging the correct value of the underlying economics tied to the earning powers in figuring out how strong they can be in the future.

According to Vicki Hollub (CEO) Oxy will start buying back shares and increasing its dividend once its debt load is below $15bn. Now its debt is around $24bn, so if they sell for $10bn and use all of it to pay down debt, I think shareholder return are going to increase substantially even at current oil prices.

As a shareholder of OXY I would like to see the sale coming through, especially at $10bn. The only thing I don’t quite understand is that Vicki Hollub repeatedly said that its CCS/U project uses large amounts of Chemicals (mainly KOH) for which oxychem is the largest or second largest producer in the US and this way they have many synergies. I bought oxy for their reserves and their relatively low break even in the Permian and I don’t really think that their carbon capture business will take off, but I don’t like that the CEO is inconsistent there.

I got an idea to create an intrinsic value editor that allows users to calculate the fair value of a company’s stock by entering key inputs such as free cash flow, growth rate, and discount rate as well as many metrics from the financial statements. The editor automatically applies the intrinsic value formula and displays the results in real time. You can also set up if statements within the tool, for example, “if the intrinsic value is higher than the current market price, display a message that the stock is undervalued.” In addition, you can configure alerts so that when certain conditions are met — like a stock becoming 20% undervalued — the tool notifies you instantly. This makes the editor not only a calculator, but also a decision-support system for smarter investing.

Sometimes of course this is true. Bad management, stupid ideas, and new management can fix it.

But it's also the case that a company could have once been great because of luck, factors out of their control, how the world was in that time that it allowed them to thrive.

For example: Disney. Disney got big by being THE company for family entertainment. In an era when making movies had a high cost barrier to entry. When publicity depended on being connected to media, rather than word of mouth. As movie technology was constantly changing. And those things no longer exist. Might Disney return? Maybe, but you can't assume an automatic spring back because the world that made them a titan no longer exists.

Or Intel. This is constantly mentioned on here, but everyone seems to forget they got huge because IBM picked them for their PC and when that opened up and we got Dell and HP clones, they all used an Intel chip. You wanted Windows, you had to go Intel. Gradually, PCs have flattened in terms of sales, ARM won the phone market and it growing into other areas like Macs, servers and Windows on ARM. Then there's RISC-V in China to consider. The US government scaring China about getting chips led to them investing more in their own technology.

Therefore, I would like to share some less popular stocks that you also might consider as a long term investor:

* Azelis Group (AZE), a Belgian company. A serial acquirer of companies in special chemicals distribution. In my opinion, highly undervalued.
* FastNed BV (FAST), a Dutch charging station company. This relative new company is still cash flow negative, but the potential is huge. I like their story. Probably in two or three years cash flow positive.
* Fugro (FUR), geotechnical and geoscience services. This company had a lot of headwinds in 2025 due to cancelled oil/gas/wind projects. The investor sentiment is at it lowest... Still, their balance sheet looks ok. And long term, I think these projects will still continue. Now it is Trump in the white house, but one way or the other, the global energy transition (from oil to renewable energy) is going to happen.

1nslvir,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 07:23:53,Salesforce (CRM) - Is the market sentiment incorrect or am I missing something?,"Hi there, currently need to present a stock pitch in University, company must have a moat, attractive valuation, market cap of +$1B and be on the USA stock exchange. As title states, **is salesforce undervalued at current period?** Is there any other lens I should be considering with this company? I can't upload images so I'll upload my excel spreadsheet findings so far. Bonus points if you have a link for an outstanding stock pitch ppt lol. 

For price forecasting, myself and many other investment funds forecast prices to be atleast $300 in the next 12 months implying a 23% for a neutral scenario. These prices used a DCF model and forecasting EPS/PE ratios

>***Salesforce sentiment***

1. Company layoffs early 2024 followed shortly by a revenue miss in Q1
2. Quarterly growth isn't as high as it used to be
3. Ai growth hasn't been as quick as expected
4. Skeptiscim about how ai will neagtively impact the business
5. The lower future growth output is causing PE contraction 

>***Salesforce growth catalyst***

1. Financial metrics are increasing to ATH (net/gross margins, FCF/Share, EBITA)
2. The revenue growth was from acquisition (not organic high margin growth), so a slow down in revenue from no further acquisitions make sense
3. Ratios are at near ATL (P/S, P/E, P/FCF)
4. Massive investment into AI development . Suggested 120% YoY growth in Data Cloud + AI ARR. the company said that over 40% of Data Cloud and Agentforce Q2 bookings came from existing customer expansion. This suggests that customers are finding significant value in the company’s AI and data offering and are willing to deepen their relationships with the company.
5. Q2 2025 announced a further $20B in share buy backs, brining the total to $50B of authorized share buy backs. Close to 1/4 of the companies mark cap in buybacks alone
6. On [help.salesforce.com](http://help.salesforce.com), Agentforce handled 380,000 conversations with 84% resolution; only \~2% required human escalation.

>***Bringing it together*** 

Salesforce is growing revenues at a modest rate of 8-9% net profit margins have increased 12% YoY, implying the business is becoming more efficient. 

Operating cash flow is growing at 12-13% YoY Full year guidance indicate EPS beats from $11.31 to $11.37 This net margin growth is expected to stay in double digits as Agentforce continues to rapidly grow in the next 2-3 years, growing the companies operating margins from 33% to 35/38% range. 

The business data suggests the moat is strong and growth is in line with markets, however the company is becoming more efficient increasing net cash/fcf positions With these extra profits, the company is doing mass buybacks Despite this, the P/S, P/E, P/FCF are near all time lows, dragging the stock price from of a high of $369 to $243.43 

*The markets seem to be looking through the wrong lens when approaching a thesis on salesforce.*  
Company presents a strong moat, high net margin growth with attractive price valuations and irresistible per share metrics through buybacks

My plan is it monitor these support levels and give them some room and wait until the market picks up on how undervalued they are currently once money starts moving from meme stocks to real value again.

**RDW (Redwire):** Space & defense tech – growing government and commercial contracts, recently confirmed they’ve shipped more drones to Ukraine and awarded a NASA contract.

**GDYN (Grid Dynamics):** Digital transformation & AI consulting – recurring enterprise demand, attractive margins vs peers. New visa changes are also a positive for them. Should make a big recovery with IT spend set to increase again.

**UPST (Upstart):** AI driven lending platform – improving credit performance, potential profitability inflection. Lowering interest rate environment very good for them too.

**VLN (Valens Semiconductor):** High speed connectivity chips for autos & industrial – benefits from EV and ADAS adoption. Recent partnership announced with Samsung. 

**GRRR (Gorilla Tech):** Edge AI and security analytics plus AI infrastructure – expanding in IoT and smart infrastructure. Recently announced a $1.4b deal in SE Asia with the potential to expand a further $2.5b amongst other contracts too.

1nsinid,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 03:59:44,Is Intel making a mistake?,"Full disclosure I have been interested in intel stock for a couple months now. Ever since the government took a 10% share in intel. I have been planning to invest 25k into the company but have not been liquid enough to do it just yet. 

I think intel despite its failings has a genuinely strong thesis. It’s the best US based foundry capable of producing microchips. With Chinas looming attack of Taiwan it is imperative for the U.S to have an answer for microchip production. China doesn’t have to actually take Taiwan to disable chip production , the process of making chips is so fragile that airburst from artillery could disrupt it. Microchips are core to Americas military , if TSMC is disabled we would see American military strength significantly weaken due to our weapons becoming difficult to replace and rearm. Intels success is literally a matter of national security.

That being said Intel currently is a gutted company on the verge of collapse with only a few small signs of hope such as the NVDA investment.

All of this being said I am not currently comfortable investing in Intel. Intel has seen a major increase in share price over the last couple weeks at a rate that seems detached from reality. Yes it has seen some minor wins but most of the gains are based on hype. “Intel in talks with TSMC” type of thing that doesn’t speak to the companies fundamentals. More so the stock has become a pseudo meme stock. 

I think this could be detrimental to the stock in the long run. If Intel stock keeps running up based on hype I think we will see a major retraction in the price in correlation with a market event. This type of fall will stunt intel’s long term growth due to investor fear of a repeat. Maybe even killing the company in the process. 

The question that I have is does my analysis make sense? I am still on the fence about investing in the company right now. I want to know if I should wait for the market correction or invest asap.

1nshls6,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 02:52:33,Freeport McMoRan Accident and Valuation,"Last week Freeport stock dropped more than 20% due to an accident in their Grasberg mine in indonesia. While I do understand the implications (2026,2027 lower production) are negative for the company, I don’t see why the stock dropped by so much. 

1) Usually mining (and oil) companies are valued with respect to their reserves and their cost to produce these reserves. So something like Reserves x (Commodity selling Price - Break Even Commodity Price). The accident at their mine will not change their reserves there. Of course there will be some extra costs which can be reflected in the Break Even Commodity Price of the Company (it will be increased), but I cannot believe it to be so high, that it justifies the drop we saw last week.

2) Copper Markets. No matter which source you take (BHP report, IEA Report), until 2050 there will be a massive undersupply of copper. The main reasons are declining ore head grades, almost no new discoveries and new permissions for mines takes ages (e.g. Resolution Copper for Rio and BHP is now more than 25 years in the permitting process). So if there is some supply demand imbalance here, prices are likely to rise (gold-copper-ratio also suggest that but it is not based on fundamentals). This is now somewhat of a paradoxon. When Freeport cannot pull out their copper out of the ground now, but only later when prices are (imo) much higher, and then Freeport has even higher ore Grades in 2-3 years, they make much more money than, than they lose know (OK, I do understand that there is uncertainty about that and you need to discount the future and such, but this is like a 20% risk discount which I think is irrational).

3)According to Goldman Analyst (I think it was them, but I could be wrong), due to this accident the copper supply decreased by 3% and now the world switched for a surplus to a deficit of copper. In the Barrons article it was written, that the same absolut amount of dollar which were lost in freeports market cap were gained in the market caps of BHP Rio and Glencore (because they are the largest copper producers) and will gain market share. Now, when in 2-3 years this mine comes online again with its 3% worldwide production rate (assuming everything else stays the same, I don’t think there will be more copper so the market share will be at least 3%, most likely more, see 1)). This market cap switch should be reversed, so Freeport will gain the market share it lost again.

Possible returns: 

While mining is not the classical Buffett and Munger play, I do think this is a value opportunity with a great entry point now. Copper is finite and demand will outstrip supply in the coming decades. After a drop of 20%, you will need a gain of 25%, so just waiting for Freeport to make their mine run again in the next 3 years, will give you 25% return over a period of 3 years. 

Of course I looked much more deeply in their annual reports and such but I don’t think it is relevant for this investment case. I will just say, they have 23 million ounces of gold at 1600$, and 97 billion pounds of copper at 3.25$/lb. So just looking at market prices of copper and gold right now, and making the math I described in 1), gives you the long term outlook. 

Looking forward to a discussion.

1nsfi0z,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 00:44:16,Why CSU (Constellation Software) is not a buy.,"Hey all,

I am aware of the buzz around the significant drop in CSU's stock price following the management transition from Mark Leonard to Mark Miller. While I find the market's overreaction silly, it is nothing unexpected, i am assuming the same will happen when Buffett steps down as well.

I believe the drop has been around 12 - 17% following the news. That is not a great margin of safety for a rational value investor. Also, looking at the FCF PE is still inflated, to say the least. Moreover, the actual P/E ratio is useless because they throw away so much more cash than they earn. Hence, the cash flow statement is crucial for such asset-heavy companies.

Overall i being someone who has read years of leanoards letters to shareholders, is sad to see him go, and i am sure managament that will assume roles will do fine, i do not think there is a serious margin of safety to buy, because price is a crucial factor, the underlying business is fine, but is not great, and considerng the heavy reliance on management's ability to allocate capital, unless the margin of safety is between 30 - 40%, i just cannot justify a buy.

Thanks.

Just wanted to add when I was referring to the margin of safety i meant the intrinsic value based of future earning powers while i belive most people are buying because of the 20 percent drop following the news.

1nsd54h,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 22:36:03,One of the best performing tech stocks of all time is on sale. And it’s not the Mag 7. Or even in the US.,"Constellation Software ($CSU.TO / $CNSWF) is experiencing a rare drawdown, in fact, the largest drawdown since IPO back in 2006. The founder, Mark Leonard, has been known as Canadas Warren Buffet, and is touted as one of the greatest capital allocators of all time. His shareholder letters are of renowned status, and anyone who has done any amount of research into the company knows the management quality is unparalleled. 

Constellation Software's compounding returns have quietly outshone almost every other stock since its IPO, cementing its place as one of the all-time great performers, all without being a member of the ""Magnificent Seven."" The company's unique, decentralized, long-term acquisition strategy for mission-critical vertical market software has created a fortress of recurring revenue. The services provided are known by shareholders to be sticky and switching costs are high. The company maintains relationships with potential acquisitions and holds a record of over 50,000 companies to potentially acquire. Since IPO, only one company has ever been re-sold, and Mark Leonard says this was one of his biggest regrets. 

I believe recent drawdown is entirely overblown. Skepticism over the impact of AI on its vast portfolio neglects Constellation's deep, embedded and entrenched specialized knowledge and systems in niche customer workflows—an enduring advantage against generalized AI tools. Furthermore, the stock's plunge following founder Mark Leonard's resignation for health reasons, though understandable given his legendary status, discounts the company's established, deep management bench and decentralized acquisition structure, which was built for perpetual operation beyond any single individual. The long-term thesis remains firmly intact. Mark Miller, the new CEO, himself has over 30 years with the company, leaving little doubt to his performance capabilities. 

The company typically commands a high premium, usually at 35-40x forward FCF. However, with last weeks intense sell off, the 2026E FCF multiple is currently in the low to mid 20s. I think this presents a very compelling opportunity for a company that has historically compounded at 20-30%. 

I believe this is a very rare buying opportunity. Next week, Constellation is holding a meeting to discuss the recent resignation of Mark Leonard. Volatility will likely remain high. I currently own 52 shares and will consider adding more in this dip.


**EDIT:**

Added below is one of the comments I made regarding what I believe is the root issue with the AI bear thesis - 

This is where the core issue of the AI arguement is: VMS will only lose value if they lose their customers.

I'm highly doubtful that artificial intelligence, any time in the near future, will upend and displace niche mission critical vertical market softwares. Typically, the cost of these vertical market softwares as a proportion of revenue generated from the business is one percent or less. There's no way that a municipality, utility, government agency or a healthcare facility (all common customers of CSU) will suddenly want to exchange deeply embedded VMS software for a new random vibe coded artificial intelligence mess, which will be riddled with bugs, issues, errors and inefficienceis. CSU's softwares have over the years been custom tailored and designed for each specific industry and business. Further, while AI has been shown to be decent at generating new code for simple programs, it's quite bad at debugging and fixing issues and errors. Like one commentor put it, good for greenfield, bad for brownfield. 

Imagine having to retrain hundreds of employees on how to use a new software that's been used by the business for the last fifteen to twenty years. Then fix all the new bugs, issues and inefficiencies on top of that. And remember when I said, the expense for this software is <1% of their revenue? Are they going to go through this headache? No.

Real world example - I work as a physical therapist with a home health agency. We still use a software on our company mobile devices called ""HomeCare HomeBase"" that was made for Blackberries with a keyboard and stylus for use by nurses 15 years ago. We still use it today and it's still one of the largest home health softwares used by home health agencies in the US. It's the same concept. For these businesses, switching out the software is just not worth the disruption in business operations for at best a minor operational efficiency improvement and practially no cost savings.

Also, on top of all that, consider the opposite approach with AI for CSU. Wouldn't one stand to reason that with all the proprietary data and relationships CSU has with its customers, they would actually be primed to take advantage of the AI wave and improve their own software thats already in use by their customers? That's the other way to look at AI.",324,189,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nsd54h/one_of_the_best_performing_tech_stocks_of_all/,new,Stock Analysis,0.89

1ns6vo5,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 17:28:52,A few words on the mining industry: valuing companies should be done differently.,"I think there is a core crowd here who do value investing the old fashioned way. We determine a cohort of companies, try to place a value each of them using a minimum number of assumptions, and try to identify outliers that are trading far below fair value AND have a robust future in terms of earnings forecast.

I personally work in the minerals exploration industry and spend most of my time evaluating projects there (geologically) but once in a while I do make investment decisions. I don't think I beat the market by a significant margin. But it struck me a few weeks ago that the approach I take is totally different from the normal companies on the stock market so I share it here with the aim of getting feedback.

So target cohort I'll cover here are pre-discover exploration companies. Also called ""Juniors"". They are looking for metals in various parts of the world but have effectively no assets and are pre-revenue. Somewhat comparable to startups in the tech space. But given it takes many years to develop a mine, they are likely 20+ years away from revenue because they haven't even found any metal. This is where most investors encounter the minerals industry.

Valuation at this stage relies less on financial models and more on comparables and ""optionality"" (what could they do in the near future). We look at the cost per square kilometre of land held under exploration license, or the enterprise value relative to metres drilled, as a way to anchor expectations. Others attempt a probability-weighted “real option” approach, where you assign a very small chance of discovery leading to eventual production. But in practice, the market often values these companies more on a story, management credibility, and “hot money” flows into certain commodities. Today those are things like Gold, Antimony, Tungsten, Copper, REE, maybe Uranium.

The failure risk is enormous: the geological odds of success are estimated at 1 in 2000, funding is episodic and dilutive, and the time to potential cash flow is measured in decades. And many teams are dysfunctional.

The key parameter we use is Enterprise Value (EV). In short: cash plus debt. All the money that has been poured into the business (not all of it effectively, and a majority often simply into salaries). Let me show what I do with some examples:

Lets say there are two companies, both with $5M cash (all numbers USD). A typical amount after their first raise on the stock market.

Company A is an Explorer in a conventional, proven location (like the Laramide Porphyry Belt in SW USA):

-100 km² license package.
-Located in the Laramide Copper Belt (Arizona/Mexico), proven endowment, world-class neighbors already in production.
-Good infrastructure, mining-friendly jurisdiction.

Company B is a ""Blue Sky"" Frontier Explorer, way up in Nunavut or Northern Namibia (jurisdiction OK, but not a known belt):
-1000 km² license package.
-Located in a frontier jurisdiction (e.g., parts of Africa or Central Asia) with little proven copper endowment.
-Poor infrastructure, higher jurisdiction risk. Some opaque legislation makes it hard to model outcomes for a foreign actor.

In proven belts, especially for Cu or Au, we would use a land value of 200k-500k per sqkm. So company A is valued at $20-50M plus cash = max $55M.

Company B in an unproven belt basically has moose pasture. We heavily discount the probability of them finding a deposit, even if they are assumed to be competent. Lets say 10% as good as the Laramide. So 20-50k per sqkm.

10 times the ground position gives them max $50M, plus cash = $55M.

Many many juniors stall at this $50M market cap. Its among the most popular valuation. And therefore we should be very careful with investing at this valuation. $10M in a debt-free, recently starting company with similar land position is a good ""value"" entry point, exit at $40M or before they run out of money. Because once exploration stalls, the lack of a discovery starts to crystallise into the reality.

The second way we value is using an adjusted NAV (asset value of future discovery, discounted by the likelihood of actually finding it). Like trying to value a lottery ticket based on the size of the prize.

Let’s assume a “discovery” in the Laramide belt could eventually become a 200Mt @ 0.5% Cu deposit, with a net project NPV of ~$2B once built.

I mentioned industry statistics suggest the probability of a grassroots explorer making a discovery that reaches production is about 1 in 2000.

But in the Laramide Belt, odds may improve to 1 in 200–300 given proven fertility, leveraging existing historic work, and proximity to infrastructure (lowering the threshold for something being economic).

In a frontier region, odds may be worse, say still at 1 in 2000.

Company A (Laramide):
-0.5% chance (1/200) × $2B NPV = $10M expected value.

Add cash on hand (EV): $5M = ~$15M equity value.

Market might still pay a premium for attractive metal like Cu/press narrative/management = $20–30M cap.

Company B (Frontier):
-0.05% chance (1/2000) × $2B = $1M expected value.

Add cash: $5M → ~$6M equity value.

Market perception might lift to $10–15M if commodity (e.g., copper) is hot.

This is why I would say the mid-point $40M is an excellent exit point for a given position on a safe bet exploration play. Track record of the board is often earning a small premium but in my opinion its largely anecdotal and ALL companies try to inflate their credit to hit this extra premium.

So who is at this level already? Alta Copper TSX:ATCU (drilling out a resource but authorisation obstacles), Group11 (probably overvalued), Hannan Metals (way overvalued given their assets), District Metals (also way overvalued).

Who is close? Atico CVE:ATY (actually they have a short-life resource so probably undervalued), Havilah Resources (almost 1Mt Cu plus gold in the ground, 70% undervalued I would say), Max resources (using average of EV and NAV as above).

Who is way below: Anglesey Mining AYM.L (historic mine, small land position, jurisdiction has legislative risks), Firefox gold (lack of any real discovery), Eurobattery Minerals (I think their ground is terrible).

Anyway think about this when evaluating early stage exploration juniors. There is a lot of noise on this forum about juniors and its really easy to value them.

If there is interest I will post something on strategic metals because they might allow us to add extra value due to ""offtake interest"", or tax incentive from the jurisdiction on a future discovery.

1ns5fjr,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 16:27:49,Overpriced Equity Market Bonds & Other Safe Assets,"One thing I learned quite hard way is not try to predict the market. However, the current equity market is at all time highs and prices look quite expensive except few stocks which got hammered down.

From this perspective, I am thinking whether it makes sense to start moving money to bonds. I had been doing small investments in bond market from last year however it is becoming increasingly hard to beat inflation after the returns.

2024 Bond market really came down and I am thinking with an equity crash whether we will see lower interest rate again. However, I can see what could happen with government debt being so high and they could repeat what they did in 1945.

""1945 financial repression"" refers to the period following World War II when many governments, including the United States, implemented financial repression policies to manage their high debt loads. These policies included artificially keeping interest rates low and controlling financial institutions to reduce the real value of their accumulated government debt and lower debt-to-GDP ratios. 

**Key characteristics of financial repression after 1945:**

* **Low Interest Rates:** Governments set interest rates at artificially low levels, often below the rate of inflation, to make their debt cheaper to service. 
* **Government Control:** Authorities often controlled the financial sector, directing capital and limiting financial choices to ensure government debt was held and that funds were available for public investment. 
* **Debt Management:** The primary goal was to reduce the burden of war-related debt, which was as high as 100% of GDP for some nations in 1945. 
* [**Liquidation**](https://www.google.com/search?cs=0&sca_esv=fe0550819d8f48a0&sxsrf=AE3TifObF5u0NPdhgBJxFHFY-DAM6Kj92g%3A1759004713747&q=Liquidation&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjksOGY4_mPAxW9T6QEHfIxAR4QxccNegQIDhAB&mstk=AUtExfCKxmEa5io003LXQvDvn6s5Ds91RdDLKbDc81Ze5vtNs2hVxSCN3UGoiv4XBBBSwYxre-TFvMh5lEWFyL76MmTOItadNveCyw1wNwSLXmFgwftSDAUgWDI94PGrnAgd2LXuiUotq9vOOTuLHHz9HXJGAvJElEX49LPf33941jXVtac&csui=3) **of Debt:** By keeping real interest rates negative, governments effectively ""liquidated"" their debt, meaning the real value of the money owed to bondholders decreased over time

It looks a bit more scarier than a 2008 because both equity and bond markets look riskier. Gold would have been an option but you cannot be 100% gold in a portfolio and Gold is at all time high.

Would like everyone's views or hypothesis and may be a good strategy can be carved.

Update Here is what Claude AI said on this. Worth reading.

""Based on current evidence, here are the key indicators that suggest the US government may be preparing for or moving toward financial repression policies:

# Direct Policy Indicators

# 1. Debt Management Crisis

The debt limit was reinstated at $36.1 trillion on January 2, 2025, representing the total amount of outstanding debt. The Treasury is already using extraordinary measures, including tapping civil service and postal retirement funds to meet federal obligations. This shows the government is under significant debt pressure.

# 2. Interest Rate Suppression Mechanisms

Markets are pricing in continued Fed rate cuts, with 89% probability of another 0.25% cut at the October 2025 meeting and high odds of additional December cuts. This suggests policy makers are committed to keeping rates low despite potential inflationary pressures.

# 3. Yield Curve Control Discussion

Under yield curve control (YCC), the Fed would target longer-term rates and pledge to buy enough long-term bonds to keep rates from rising above target. While not yet implemented, countries are actively using YCC policies in real time, suggesting this tool is being seriously considered.

# Structural Economic Indicators

# 4. Debt Servicing Pressure

The rise of net debt cost-to-government-revenues ratio is expected to slow in 2025, partly because short-term yields have declined, somewhat narrowing the yield gap between maturing and new bonds. This shows the government is acutely aware of debt servicing costs and benefits from suppressed rates.

# 5. Institutional Framework Changes

In December 2024, GAO recommended that Congress consider immediately replacing the debt limit with an approach that links debt decisions to spending and revenue decisions. This could remove debt ceiling constraints that currently limit the government's ability to implement financial repression.

# Historical Context

Financial repression policies involve measures that enable governments to place debt with financial institutions at ""artificially low interest rates,"" and it wasn't just the US that used this method historically. Financial repression is intended to help governments deleverage over time by artificially lowering yields on government bonds.

# Key Warning Signs to Monitor:

**Immediate Indicators:**

* Implementation of yield curve control by the Federal Reserve
* Regulatory pressure on banks to hold more government bonds
* Capital controls or restrictions on international investments
* Negative real interest rates becoming persistent policy

**Policy Rhetoric:**

* Emphasis on ""financial stability"" over market-determined rates
* Discussion of making the financial system serve ""national priorities""
* Increased regulation of pension funds and insurance companies

**Market Behavior:**

* Unusual Treasury auction dynamics or direct Fed intervention
* Persistent yield curve suppression despite inflation
* Regulatory changes that effectively force institutions to hold government debt

The current situation shows many preconditions for financial repression are present: high debt levels, political pressure to keep borrowing costs low, and central bank tools that can suppress longer-term rates. While not yet fully implemented, the infrastructure and justifications for such policies are being established.""",0,1,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ns5fjr/overpriced_equity_market_bonds_other_safe_assets/,new,Question / Help,0.25

However, if you look closely into Waste Management (WM), it is one of the most durable compounding machines in the U.S. economy. On the surface, it looks like basic trash collection, landfill ownership, and recycling. But under the surface is an almost impossible moat to replicate:

High barriers to entry - New landfills are extraordinarily difficult to permit, regulate, and finance. The existing network of WM is an irreplaceable asset.

Pricing power with inflation pass-through - Many contracts allow them to alter rates automatically, while still protecting margins.

Capital allocation discipline - WM will consistently return free cash flow via dividends and buybacks, but continues to reinvest to become more efficient.

This is a business that thrives in the background of daily life. While investors are lining up stocks for the next tech disruptor, Waste Management is compounding wealth by managing something that society literally cannot live without.

DNNGY is an OTC ADR in USD, and D2G is the listing on German exchanges in EUR.

They represent the same underlying company (Ørsted).

So what could explain such a discrepancy? Some hypotheses I have:

- Timing / delay in market adjustments across jurisdictions

- FX (USD/EUR) translation effects

- Low liquidity or order book depth in the ADR market

1nrem7q,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 18:15:30,how I am using AI to get better investing ideas (critiques welcome),"I have a script that runs at 5 am UTC on github every night. Let's divide its function into three parts:

Step I:

\- scrapes major subreddits like wsb valueinvesting etc. for all ticker mentions in the last 24 hours  
\- goes through openinsider to see any new cluster buys and notes the ticker  
\- goes through everything on dataroma to see if any superinvestor has bought anything recently

this gives us [step I spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sX6mbFIG7uiQxbCwPuF-tp2am5TspgLoEXmqwrAeAJ0/edit?gid=0#gid=0). Basically a list of interesting tickers to look at. Currently has 2320 entries and updated every day.

Step II:

\- filters out tickers that got there by mistake / wrong names / etfs etc.  
\- a deeper dive into things we like to see like insider buying, share reduction over the last year, superinvestors that are also in. Based on this it assigns each opportunity a score.  
\- people will say why not current ratio, rising revenue, etc. it is because these signals are often noisy and corrupt the data. Too many outliers and variations in financials

this gives us [step II spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sX6mbFIG7uiQxbCwPuF-tp2am5TspgLoEXmqwrAeAJ0/edit?gid=359346395#gid=359346395).

Step III:

\- we get ideas with the highest score based on step II  
\- the real fun begins we use the latest model of gemini to get the following  
\- business summary, company history, moat analysis  
\- management record, management incentives, catalyst analysis  
\- price history, bull thesis, assumptions baked in, bear scenario  
\- next steps to look at / questions to ask

The result is this sick [Step III spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sX6mbFIG7uiQxbCwPuF-tp2am5TspgLoEXmqwrAeAJ0/edit?gid=831501853#gid=831501853). Just take a look at how beautiful the analysis is. Gives you a solid basis to look at companies. New models are really good at getting info from the web so that's SEC filings, earnings calls, news, etc. so I cannot recommend it highly enough. I think valuation is a very personal thing which one should do themselves but qualitative analysis with the good and bad is a good starting point.

Step III script is slow because it calls the LLM for all these small qualitative things, but should eventually catch up with the previous ones.

The stock since IPO has been a terrible investment, falling over 80% since its 2021. On the other hand, its latest financial report was great. We saw 14% revenue growth and, more importantly, a swing to profitability.

So is the market right to be so sceptical? UiPath is the undisputed king of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), but now it's facing an existential threat from Microsoft. Their big bet to survive is a pivot to ""agentic automation,"" giving AI brains to their RPA bots to handle complex work.

The full bull case is they can solve AI's ""last mile"" problem, and finally give AI a **real** use case for the average company. The bear case is that Microsoft's ecosystem could crush them.

# 1. 🔥 Reboot Spotlight to Rival TikTok

* **Algorithm Overhaul**: Invest in AI-driven personalization to boost content discovery and engagement.
* **Creator Monetization**: Launch a revenue-sharing model for creators to attract talent and viral content.
* **Social Commerce Integration**: Embed shopping features directly into Spotlight to tap into TikTok’s 43.8% conversion rate.

# 2. 💰 Monetize the AR Platform

* **License AR Tools**: Offer Snap’s AR tech to third-party apps, retailers, and advertisers.
* **Easy Lens Expansion**: Scale the AI-powered lens creation tool for brands and SMBs.
* **AR Commerce**: Enable virtual try-ons and interactive ads with direct purchase options.

# 3. 📈 Scale AI Advertising

* **Smart Campaign Suite**: Expand AI ad tools for SMBs to automate targeting and boost ROI.
* **Attention Metrics**: Promote Snap’s eye-tracking and media quality tools to advertisers for better performance tracking.
* **Sponsored Snaps & Promoted Places**: Package immersive ad formats for travel, retail, and entertainment brands.

# 4. 🧠 Streamline Operations

* **Cut Moonshots**: Pause or spin off hardware projects like Spectacles unless they show near-term ROI.
* **Lean Product Teams**: Consolidate overlapping features and reduce engineering overhead.
* **Focus on High-Margin Revenue**: Prioritize Snapchat+ and AR ad formats over low-margin brand ads.

# 5. 📊 Financial Discipline

* **Target Positive Free Cash Flow by Q4 2026**: Set aggressive cost controls and revenue benchmarks.
* **Debt Restructuring**: Address \~$1.5B net debt burden through refinancing or asset sales.
* **Quarterly Profitability Goals**: Tie executive compensation to operating income milestones.

# 6. 🌍 Expand Demographic Reach

* **Grow Beyond Gen Z**: Develop features for older users—family sharing, professional networking, and secure messaging.
* **Global Expansion**: Localize content and ad tools for emerging markets with high mobile penetration.

# 🧩 Bonus: Acquisition Contingency Plan

If Snap fails to hit profitability targets by 2027, prepare for strategic acquisition talks with:

* **Amazon** (for AR commerce)
* **Apple** (for camera tech)
* **Netflix** (for short-form content)

Snap’s tech is strong. Its user base is loyal. But without bold moves, it risks becoming a niche app with cool features and no future. This roadmap is about **scaling smart, monetizing hard, and cutting deep**.

This raises some important questions for value investors:

* Buybacks only create value when done below intrinsic value;but how many management teams actually follow this discipline?
* Unlike dividends, buybacks are harder totrust as a consistent yield. They depend on timing, market conditions, and management psychology.
* Some firms like Apple, Home Depot have done repurchases brilliantly, while others have destroyed billions.

**So here’s the question:**  
Are we overestimating buybacks as a shareholder-friendly tool?

But it got me thinking: are we collectively undervaluing the potential for long-term compounding in industries that are more “boring” but still essential to modern economies?

Consider examples like waste management, railroads, specialty chemicals, or niche industrial parts suppliers. These firms often:

-Operate in oligopolistic markets with high barriers to entry.

-Have recurring, sticky demand regardless of economic cycles.

-Generate significant free cash flow, which gets returned to shareholders or reinvested efficiently.

-Benefit from inflation pass-through in ways investors don’t always price in.

-When you zoom out, a business growing earnings at 7–10% annually for decades—without major disruption risk—might actually outperform many higher-growth, higher-volatility tech bets (especially if bought at a fair valuation).

I’m a beginner investor from Spain and I’ve been investing in stocks for about a year. Currently, I work two jobs to save and invest as much money as possible during these early years in the market.

So far, my main strategy has been investing in traditional ETFs like the S&P 500. However, I’m now looking to diversify a small part of my portfolio into products that combine stock investing with options strategies, similar to ETFs like SPYI or QQQI. From what I understand, these ETFs use options to generate extra income and distribute monthly dividends, which appeals to me because I want to:

Reduce the overall volatility of my portfolio

Generate passive income

Eventually, over the long term, be able to leave one of my jobs and have a more relaxed lifestyle

Since I live in Spain, I would love to get some advice:

Are there any ETFs similar to SPYI or QQQI that are accessible to investors in Spain?

Which brokers do you recommend for investing in these products from Spain?

1nr7bir,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 13:21:56,It might be time to bet the farm on Constellation Software ($CSU.TO) and Topicus ($TOI.V),"Constellation Software is one of those ""if you know, you know"" companies. For those unaware, the founder and CEO Mark Leonard just stepped down as president of the company for health concerns. He will still remain director of the board, and current COO Mark Miller will assume the President role. 

This guy belongs in the same conversation as Warren Buffett for the capital allocation GOAT. Since the 2006 IPO, Constellation has returned ~35% per year, making it around a 200 bagger in 20 years. This didn't come from a single home run product like Google or Facebook, it was just 20 years of masterful capital deployment by acquiring vertical market software businesses.

I don't want to list out every financial performance metric here, but do yourself a favor and look up a 10 year chart for revenue and free cash flow per share. They keep the share count exactly the same, they don't have high debt levels, and they deploy nearly all of their free cash flow into new acquisitions. The performance is simply staggering, given the size. 

Well, after the news of Mark Leonard stepping down, shares of $CSU.TO are cratering. This is really surprising to me, as Leonard has made it a point to insist that the system that management has built doesn't rely on any single key figure, but more on a culture of excellence spread through a series of decentralized operating groups. Either way, I think the market is offering us a great discount on one of the best businesses in the world. 

Topicus ($TOI.V) is a spin off of one of the aforementioned operating groups, employing the same strategy as Constellation Software, but with faster growing companies based in Europe. Leonard is still on the board, and the Constellation DNA is very evident. They have deployed massive amounts of capital over the past year, and they are operating in a geography with much less competetive capital markets, resulting in comparatively attractive prices.

Both of these companies are now trading at EV/FCF ratios in the low to mid twenties. This is extremely reasonable, arguably cheap, for businesses of this level of quality.

Starbucks has reported six straight quarters of declining same-store sales, though the latest 2% drop was better than expected. CEO Brian Niccol announced new restructuring efforts aimed at cutting costs and focusing on long-term growth.

The company plans to close 900 underperforming stores and reduce corporate jobs, with employees receiving support packages and benefit extensions. Savings from these cuts will be reinvested into store redesigns and innovations, with about $150,000 planned per location.

By fiscal 2026, Starbucks targets a 30% reduction in costs and will introduce a new standalone store design featuring 32 seats and a drive-thru.

1nqzyr0,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 08:25:42,Is Google Stock a Still Bargain? 10-Year Return Expectations,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better.

However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it.

When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value.  
After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years.

From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500.

Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations.

Anyways here are the results:

FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR  
EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR  
Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR

So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price?  
Probably not.

Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs.

That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding.

Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels.

For me this is a clear hold.

If you want to look at the calculations for the model:

1nqzog9,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 08:11:15,Small portfolio value investing: focus on fundamentals over flashy trends,"Been thinking about the challenges we face as retail investors with smaller portfolios, especially when competing against institutional money. After watching countless retail investors chase meme stocks and AI hype over the past couple years, I keep coming back to the basics that actually work for our scale. The math is pretty straightforward: with less than $100K, every percentage point of loss hits harder, so protecting capital becomes even more critical than chasing the next big thing.

What's worked for me is sticking to companies with consistent earnings growth over 3-5 years, keeping debt-to-equity ratios below 0.5, and actually reading the financials instead of following social media buzz. Sure, it's boring compared to swing trading hot stocks, but compound growth from quality dividend payers has been way more reliable than trying to time market swings. The real edge we have over institutions is patience and the ability to hold positions without quarterly pressure from investors.

Anyone else finding that the fundamentals approach works better with smaller accounts?

I have also heard about logistical complaints and am wondering what metrics can be studied to verify these conclusions. This is just an example of my thought process.

Current contracts are for research purposes - again there is no current viable path to profits using quantum computers. 

The largest issue with quantum computers is the error rate. With a ~0.1% error rate per operation, as operations scale the results therefore become useless.

The stock is up 800% in the last year. This parabolic move without commensurate fundamental economic shift is synonymous with a bubble.

My buddy is a big fan of QCOM largely due to their patents and market share - according to him, nearly every single cell phone (Apple, android, and any other brands) use QCOM technology to make their phones, and those who do not use QCOM technology in their cellular devices, still owe a percentage of revenue/royalty to QCOM on sales due to QCOM’s 300,000+ patents surrounding wireless communication.

I love the sound of that, but obviously concerns regarding a monopoly arise in my mind. I’d like to gauge the sentiment of you all - is the fear of QCOM being labeled a monopoly and/or their patents being stripped away a major long-term concern?

QCOM has a solid 2% annual dividend yield, with a reasonable PE ratio of 16.5 - $10.3 billion in revenue last quarter and $2.7 billion in net income should mean they are roughly producing $40 billion in revenue annually, and making more than $10 billion in net income (25% + profit margins). 

I’ll obviously continue to look further into QCOM before making an investment, but like I said, want to hear the sentiment of you all. A company I would like to build an initial position in, turn on dividend reinvestments, and periodically add to the position over the next decade or two. 

Appreciate any responses and happy investing. ",35,34,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nq9ft6/thought_on_investing_in_qualcomm_qcom_over_the/,new,Discussion,0.96
1nq8xah,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 10:53:52,5 Ways I Manage Risk in My Stock Portfolio,"As markets grind higher, I find more of my analyses and thinking erring on the side of caution. This is not a sell everything post. I just think it is worth revisiting not just how we make money but how we avoid losing too much of it. Admittedly, I am rereading Howard Marks remarks over time which may also be influencing my perspective.

Nevertheless, I wanted to share 5 things I wrote down and do to keep risk in check, specifically as it pertains to my stock portfolio:

1. I invest in quality stocks. By quality I am referring to stocks that have durable moats, strong balance sheets, and consistent profitability. Generally, these companies tend to fall less in downturns and recover faster.
2. I attempt to avoid overpaying for companies. This is because even great companies can be terrible investments at the wrong price. I use relative valuation as well as DCF analyses to find companies where the market's expectations are reasonable.
3. Diversification. Concentration seems to be a more acceptable avenue for portfolio construction these days. I am not knocking it, but I do not think that there is value in diversification to manage risk. I use ETFs to provide the foundation for my portfolio, while carrying individual positions that are built to about 5% of my portfolio. Yes. I let winners run.
4. Cash can offer incredible benefits. And there is nothing wrong with building cash positions when things appear stretched. Cash is not dead money anymore. Today, cash can earn 4-5% while also providing confidence when things get scary.
5. This one is not for everyone, but I selectively sell calls on positions that I perceive are overheated. Doing so generates income and trims risk. There are risks to this strategy, though.

To be clear, none of these eliminate losses. But taken together, the goal is to make downturns survivable and gives us the confidence to be opportunistic.

I elaborate in a bit more detail [here](https://arbalistmoney.com/5-ways-i-protect-my-stock-portfolio-from-risk/), if interested.

1nq8qsz,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 10:46:50,Short-term vs. long-term,"Lately, I’ve been struggling with the question of whether I should stick to a long-term investing strategy or try to take advantage of short-term opportunities, especially in the tech/AI sector.

On one hand, companies like NVIDIA, Amazon, and ASML have strong long-term potential and are part of big trends like AI and semiconductors. But on the other hand, valuations are stretched, and the market seems overheated in the short term.

Should I wait for a correction? Or keep dollar-cost averaging into strong names regardless of short-term price?

Both strategies have risks:

* Going short-term can lead to emotional decisions and timing mistakes.
* Going long-term might mean holding through big drawdowns, especially if a stock was overhyped.

How do you balance short-term market signals with long-term conviction?

1nq68sy,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 09:05:28,Help this poor soul understand stocks,"Hi all,

Recently, I’ve been buying stocks with a part of my salary every month. This makes saving money every month a lot easier (and more entertaining) for me. So far, I have Intel, United Healthcare, Energy Fuels Inc and Boeing stocks in my portfolio. Among these stocks, I wanted to hear your opinion about Boeing. 

Before I bought Boeing this week I had a silly notepad listing some of my reasons:

* US government backing
* Production of F-22 successor F-47
* Palantir collaboration
* Already has a high backlog of orders
* Started delivering to China-orders were halted since trade wars
* China expected to order up to 500 planes
* Turkish Airlines expected to order 250 planes (order is expected to go through today 09-25)

I recognize that it is definitely not the greatest company out there and is dealing with a lot of problems. However, from my perspective the company has a clear path for future growth. I believe the reasons I listed outweighs the company’s current problems. This is clearly not the case for most people and company is not attracting investors. 

As the absolute beginner here, I wanted to hear from you, why I’m wrong and the flaws of my logic.

1nq42p5,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 07:21:23,Portillos (PLTO,"** Ticker is PTLO **
(Couldn't see how to edit title?)

Opened new position yesterday at $6.36.

Synopsis:
- Fast casual chain based out of Chicago featuring Chicago favorites (Italian beef, hot dogs, Polish sausage, etc.) and standard fare (burgers, fries, etc.)
- IPO'd in 2021 at $20, quick run up to over $47, mainly declining since
- Market cap $477M
- Down 45% last 3 mos, 51% last year
- CEO since 2018 was termed this week, new CEO search now underway

Financials (a/o end 30 Jun):
- $727M revenue +3.62% growth
- 40.3% GP, 10.3% op margin, 4.8% net, 13.2 EBITDA
- Book value $6.38/share
- Debt to equity 1.29

Risks:
- Catching a falling knife?
- Same store sales pretty stagnant
- Growth slowing
- Popularity for Chicago style food outside Chicagoland and select transplant areas (e.g. FL, AZ) is not a given, especially given it is quite unhealthy and GLP1 use
- More capital intensive restaurant model than other fast casual competitors 

""So I have that going for me"":
- Still quite early in terms of national expansion possibilities - as of Nov last year, just 10 states and <100 stores (may have increased some since then)
- Fiercely loyal core fans of the food
- Lowering interest rates outlook benefits their debt situation
- Room to improve margins with more focus on efficiency and innovation
- Valuation on low end
- +2.2% price over the last week, which includes CEO change annlincement

Getting in now is a bit of a gamble I'll admit. Been on watchlist for awhile. Decided that the CEO change, pause in the falling price, and rate cuts are enough potential catalysts to stake an initial position (1% of trading account).

Disclaimer: I am Chicago native who likes the food but lives outside the area and wishes they'd expand to my state. 

Interested to hear other opinions.

1nppu6c,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 18:18:57,The Case for Amneal Pharmaceuticals (AMRX),"Got into Amneal at around $2 in late October of 2022 and am still holding after my 400%+ gain because I believe the stock still has room to grow significantly. JPM recently raised PTs to $14 and GS to $12 as the company begins to develop a significant foothold in the specialty and affordable medicines space. I believe the stock will continue to increase due to these 3 reasons:

1. AMRX trades at a discount to peers on EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples. If execution continues, re-rating toward peer multiples alone could justify $12–$15/share

2. Historically, Amneal was weighed down by debt post-merger. Stronger operating cash flow, refinancing (just completed this summer) at lower rates, and paydown efforts are improving the capital structure

3. The company has over 100 ANDAs pending, including complex generics that carry greater barriers to entry. Recent FDA approvals and launches (GLIADEL Wafer, biosimilars like Releuko and Fylnetra) show execution capability

and most importantly...

  
LEADERSHIP!!!

Amneal is co-led by two CEOs, Chirag and Chintu, who have an incredible grasp on the pharma space and have the entire company ""bought in"" on their mission. Amneal went public via a merger in 2018 and peaked at around $24 before crashing by over 90%. Chirag and Chintu, who were on the Board of Directors at the time, returned post-crash and began to assemble a new leadership team, which has resulted in significant growth over the last 5 years.

1npnv31,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 16:58:37,"How capitalism will collapse run away from money, run toward gold now","
There’s a huge job market crisis, the threat of AI, and people are scared of the future. What happens next? People afraid of what’s coming don’t want to hold money anymore they put it into safe assets. They buy gold. The dollar drops in value.

Yes, I think people should abandon the dollar the paper money that companies and the rich hoard. It’s useless in this economy. Hoard gold. Hoard real assets.

Companies keep generating profits, quarter after quarter, but they don’t hire people. They just grow richer and more independent from workers. But are they really? If being rich is measured by how many paper dollars you own, they can become poor overnight if people simply refuse to value paper money.

If 99% of the money belongs to the rich, then the poor should just stop using it. Leave paper money behind.

I read that 100 years ago, the amount of gold an average person could buy with their salary was much higher than today. That shows how worthless paper money has become.

So leave paper money and buy tangible assets gold, and others with real value. Companies can multiply paper money endlessly, but they can’t control limited assets.

This is the era of walking away from useless paper money. Young people will never be able to buy a home with paper money.

Go for gold, go for limited assets, go for things with real value.

Yes, companies generate profits but don’t hire anyone. Fine. Then I opt out of this system. I won’t hold my savings in paper. Every salary they pay me, I convert into gold or other tangible assets.

They pay us with paper shit that’s worth less and less in this economy. So keep only the bare minimum of paper for basic needs and save the rest in gold. That’s something they can’t print, can’t multiply, can’t control with interest rates.

Protect yourself from latestage capitalism, because money will keep losing value.

As companies hoard all the paper money, let them. We, ordinary people, should leave them with their useless paper while we hold gold and real assets just like before they tricked us into replacing real value with worthless paper.




Today, gold is the back swan event, because the dollar will soon collapse. Companies hoard all the profits, house prices in dollars are insanely high, and paper money is worth nothing.

I go to work, I get paid a salary and that only makes sense as long as, in some reasonable perspective, I can afford a house. A big house with a pool, not a rat-sized apartment for 3 million.

But young people today? They’re supposed to believe that if they just keep their jobs jobs that might not even be taken over by AI they’ll maybe afford a house in their 50s or 60s.

Paper money is worth nothing. The real Black Swan event that people don’t even see is this staying away from paper money. Buy assets. Buy value. Buy tangible things, not worthless paper whose value keeps dripping and dropping every year, paper money loosing value is a sure thing ",0,29,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1npnv31/how_capitalism_will_collapse_run_away_from_money/,new,Discussion,0.33

I started to understand value investing as I got more experience, and one thing I've struggled with is managing my own life and keeping in touch with the news. When my personal life gets busy (exams, tests, internships, traveling), not following the news a lot of times make me feel like I'm losing out on profits. 

An example from my experience is that I bought ASML around February and it stayed at around the same price until their earnings report I think 2 months ago (could be wrong on the time). The stock fell 10% due to the report and I had to decide whether I want to buy more. It fell as their earnings report detailed that due to tariffs and other factors, their earnings might not grow in 2026 (very rough summary). As I was busy during that time, I didn't feel informed enough to double down on my position, which looking back on it now, I think I would've if I took the time to look into it (obviously could be hindsight). 

For more context, I hold stocks usually for over a year, and I look to hold companies that are undervalued with wide moat. Therefore, although I'm not as impacted by short term new sentiment, I do wish to capitalize on it when I have firm belief in the foundational value of a stock and the movement  is just short term.

1npj763,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 13:59:30,Is Sprouts Farmers Market ($SFM) Undervalued?,"$SFM has been touted as a long-term growth company; but, after climbing almost 475% in a relatively short time (5 years), has shed 20.3% of its share price in just the past month.

To be completely upfront, I picked up shares of $SFM at $140/share back in February.  At that time, it was right on the border if its intrinsic value calculation.  From a Value Investing perspective, I didn't give myself much Margin of Safety....  Nonetheless, I was thrilled as the stock climbed to $182/share...only to tumble to its current level of $116/share.  So, my thesis is that $SFM is indeed undervalued.

What caused such a precipitous drop?  Well, we all know that Mr. Market is moody, fickle, unbalanced, the list goes on.  The market has soured on specialty retailers and grocers; so no surprise that while Sprouts continues to expand and grow, it's stock is being sold.  Let's look at a few numbers \[with help from Simply Wall Street\]:

**Discounted Cash Flow Model:**  FCF sits at $499.6M.  Based on analysts' growth forecast, FCF is expected to hit \~$922M by 2029.  DCF's model then calculates the stocks fair value at $236 per share; or, undervalued by 49%.

**Price vs. Earnings:**  Sprouts' current PE Ratio sits at 24.3x, with the industry/peer average around 21x.  SWS's ""Fair Ratio"" (incorporates the company’s actual earnings growth, sector-specific risks, profit margins, and even market capitalization) comes out to 22.0x; so in context, SFM isn't too far off.

**Other Models Quick Summary**:  Without belaboring the data, looking across several other models I find fair valuations ranging from $155 to $209.  My own calculations using the conservative Rule #1 model yields a ""Sticker Price"" of $132.56, and thus a 20% MoS of $106.05, or ultra-conservative 50% MoS of $66.28.

I see a target of opportunity for anyone willing to hold the company for more than just a short-term swing trade.  So, I still have my original shares at $140 (yes...in the red right now), and I have cash covered PUTs to buy additional shares at $120 and $115.  I'm still not giving myself much MoS, but for a company with relatively low long-term debt to FCF, and ROIC consistently over 10% for the past 10 years, I'm happy to be a part owner of Sprouts Farmers Market for the next several years.

  
UPDATE:  Yep.  I see it.  $SFM down again today (25 Sep).  I continue to scour for news as to why, and continue to find bull-case articles and assertions that it is ""undervalued"" and ""oversold""--likely a result of fund managers behaving like lemmings as they often do.  This reminds me of $RH where they were crushed by tariff news, then had a better-than-expected quarter (plus tariff postponement) and over-rebounded, then fell off a cliff again.  It took a few months, but now they are showing signs of a more reasonable, slow-steady climb (I sold my shares at $230).  I'm anticipating a similar pattern for SFM.",8,60,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1npj763/is_sprouts_farmers_market_sfm_undervalued/,new,Stock Analysis,0.7

His fiance is pregnant with their first child. A baby boy so I am a grandfather at the age of 43. I would like to do something to give my grandson a little head start when he gets older. I would like to open a stock portfolio for him now. He will be born in March. Then, let it grown until he is about 30 years of age or so. I figure by that time he will have completed college. Be settled into a career and possibly be settled down a little. 

I tried investing in bitcoin and the stock market years ago. I picked the wrong time to do it. It turned out to be right before COVID and it was all bad. I lost a good bit of money. I contribute a good bit of it to not knowing what the hell I was doing too. Now I have been doing a lot of reading and research. I started a little project since then where I invested a little money to get my feet wet and was able to do pretty good. Therefore, I would like to start another project for my grandson.

I did pretty good with a little small portfolio I put together for practice. Just a couple hundred bucks to get my feet wet. I basically just picked stocks from companies whose products I use and know about. I work in computer repair so most of the stocks were technology stocks. I know about diversifying your portfolio. That ETFs are more conservative where individual companies is more risky. So I know the basics which is why I am asking for help and advice.

My question is if I do something like I just did where I start a small portfolio. Say maybe $500 to start. Then, if I add a little money to it monthly (maybe over time other family members with pitch in) do you think I could grow it into something decent by age 30 or so? This is an amount of money I wouldn’t be upset with if I was to lose it all as long as I have a really decent shot at successfully completing the mission. 

Would it be better to maybe split the money between two portfolios? One conservative and one pretty aggressive? What would be a good strategy to go about this? Like I said I am a single parent. I am far from well off. I wish I had thousands I could have smartly invested. However, that is not the reality, and I want to leave my grandchild SOMETHING.

I’ve been looking into the recent IPO of **WaterBridge Infrastructure (WBI)** and wanted to get some perspectives from the community.

**Quick summary of the IPO:**

* Raised **$634M** by selling 31.7M Class A shares at **$20/share**.
* IPO was upsized due to stronger demand.
* Debuted on the NYSE mid-September and reportedly jumped \~14% on day one.
* Operates primarily in the **Delaware Basin**, providing water gathering, transport, recycling, and disposal for oil & gas producers.
* Business model includes **take-or-pay contracts**, which in theory could provide stable cash flows.

**Points I’m curious about:**

1. How do you see WBI’s risk/reward profile given its exposure to oil & gas cycles and regulatory risks around water disposal?
2. Does the IPO valuation look reasonable compared to other water infrastructure or midstream companies?
3. Are there comparable publicly traded peers (water management in energy, midstream infrastructure, etc.) worth benchmarking against?
4. Do you view this as a potential **long-term infrastructure play** tied to water management, or more of a niche/speculative investment?

MSFT, META, GOOG CEO’s have all acknowledged that the biggest restriction to AI growth is power not GPUs. Which companies have the most amount of power to power data centers? CRWV and CORZ. The demand is so far beyond what people currently understand. 

MSFT threw a $19B deal at NBIS for 300MW + 400MW extension. CRWV has 470MW active as of Q2 2025, and target ~1000MW by year end. They are a preferred NVIDIA partner. NVIDIA also announced that they are backstopping any excess cloud from CRWV for up to $6B up to 2030. Even if they need it or not, they agreed to this. CRWV has 2.2GW of contracted power capacity that they can expand into (the bottleneck). 

CORZ has $5B market cap. They have 900MW of power that is active and dedicated to AI but needs connecting to GPUs etc. another 400MW used for Bitcoin mining, bringing total to 1.3GW. They also have 1GW of expansion also possible. They had 50MW active and powering GPUs by Q2 2025. Year end goal is 250MW. That is 5x the revenue they were generating before. They also still have 650MW more to expand to. Remember NBIS got a $19B deal for 300MW + 400MW possible expansion. I value CORZ at $15B market cap, would not even think about selling before. I expect them to crush next earnings call and market to price them closer to fair value. For the acquisition by CRWV deal, this will not go through unless CRWV stock goes up a lot higher maybe $200. Shareholders are not happy with current deal (Two Seas capital which is largest active shareholder has shown opposition). Stock price also tanked ~30% after deal announcement, but this will also not go through unless shareholders approve (big opposition over current deal). 

Finally, just want to mention big hedge fund buying. Jane Street and Coatue Management are hedge funds that have outperformed the market significantly over last 3 years (achieving 90%+ and 180%+ over last 3 years) have made CRWV their biggest holding at 4% and 8% respectively. There is also a cracked OpenAI guy (1st in his class in Columbia) that started his own hedge fund called Situational Awareness who has like 65% returns over last two quarters has CORZ as his third biggest holding at 20% of his portfolio.

1npambc,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 08:20:12,Deep Value with $GAMB,"Recently stumbled upon some posts on here asking why gambling.com stock is so cheap right now.

They are profitable with good margins, growing, got a great CEO who has been with the company for almost 10 years, share buybacks and more - yet the stock chart looks like they are going bankrupt.

I read trough their balance sheets and watched all interviews with the CEO and i cant find a single reason why the market is overreacting like this.
One of their recent aquisitions ""Oddjams"" has a lawsuit against them for scraping odds data from third parties but i feel like its hard to really combat data scraping and pinpoint whats legal and what crosses the line. Even if guilty, it may take years for the lawsuit to resolve.

In the meanwhile GAMB is using their insane cashflow to aquire more and more businesses while growing their marketshare and diversifying income streams.

This feels like a generational buy at these levels - i would argue there is assymetric alpha here.
The fair value of the stock is about 60-70% upside from just ebit and cashflow. Factor in the meme-worthy ticker that will tickle the wallstreetbets fans and a CEO that knows what he is doing (and is rewarded with an options plan if the stock price reaches X for 6 months) and you got a great play in my books.

Personally (and funnily enough) All-In on the stock at these levels.
Market thinks this is an affiliate marketing company but its missed that all the buyouts diversified away from it with a much broader setup for the future. They are quietly buying companies to build out their offers and tech worldwide.

Feel free to give your opinion!
I will be holding this bag for a long time - i think the future is great.

* **Market factors**
* **Future value factors**
* **Intrinsic value factors**

These factors not only influence the bids and offers in the market (which ultimately set the price), but also serve as the line between *speculating* and *investing*, depending on which factors you choose to focus on.

Big drop in free cash flow last year. Over the last five years, they averaged about $6.5 billion. Last year, just $3.5 billion. Looks like they made some capital improvements, but check out the five-year net income versus the one-year net income. Not great.

Our EM community members have it as a hold. Analyst estimates are interesting though. They have EPS jumping from $6.60 to $10.81 over the next few years.

I ran UPA through my Stock Analyzer Tool: 

Revenue growth: 2, 4, and 6 percent  
Profit margin: 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5 percent  
Free cash flow margin: 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5 percent

They consistently generate lower free cash flow than net income, so I factored that in.

PE ratios: 15, 18, and 21

That gave me a low price of $100 per share, high price of $240. Big range, as usual. Current price is about $84, so it might be worth a look if profit margins can stay steady.

Men’s underwear, cardboard boxes, and giant skeletons: Offbeat recession indicators to watch

Unemployment and consumer spending can signal the direction of the economy. Some believe more nebulous data points hold clues too.

Emma Ockerman
Tue, September 23, 2025 at 7:02 PM GMT+2 7 min read


From Labubus **(1)** and men’s underwear to lipstick and skirt hems, signs pointing to or away from a recession are everywhere.

Whether they’re accurate indicators of the economy's health is another matter.

Here’s how recessions are actually defined: A committee with the National Bureau of Economic Research **(2)** that maintains a chronology of US business cycles pores over official monthly releases from government agencies, like employment and income data, to date periods that represent a “significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.”

That process can take a while. In June 2020, for example, the NBER declared the country had entered a recession **(3)** in February of that year — an unusually fast determination. In July 2021, the NBER said **(4)** the country had exited the recession in April 2020. **(5)**

Otherwise, experts turn to other reliable, albeit unofficial, recession signs, including two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, or the “Sahm rule,” **(6)** which finds the start of a recession occurs when the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate rises 0.5 percentage points or more, relative to its 12-month low.

Now, with consumer sentiment tanking, inflation ticking higher, the job market stagnating — and social media users speculating that short, bare nails **(7)** herald economic malaise — here are other less-than-traditional measures to watch.

Cardboard boxes

Cardboard box demand is sometimes seen as an indicator of economic health, since the majority of what consumers purchase touches corrugated cardboard. Here’s the not-so-great news: Right now, US box makers are cutting back on production, ** (8)** said Jadrian Wooten, an economist at Virginia Tech. Box shipments are also down.


“I love this recession indicator, or I guess potential indicator, because it is such a common item that I think a lot of people take it for granted,” Wooten said.

Even former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan reportedly used to track cardboard prices. **(9)**

“The cardboard box industry is incredibly large — we’re talking close to $100 billion in revenue,” Wooten said. “What I always tell my students at Virginia Tech is that it’s four times as big as the NFL, and they hear about the NFL every day, on TV, on social media, there are video games about it. We don’t have that about the cardboard box industry. It’s so much more important.”

Many US boxes are shipped abroad, and exports are expected to weaken amid trade tensions, **(10)** which could help explain lower packaging demand. US consumer spending, which has so far remained resilient, may also grind lower as prices rise, dimming the need for tons of shipments.

Right now, the cardboard story is also one about capacity, Wooten said, with multiple plants being taken offline in the most dramatic cuts since the Great Recession.

All of this taking place before the holiday shopping season is doubly concerning.

“This is actually the peak time for the holiday season that we would expect to see ramp-ups in cardboard box production happening,” Wooten said. “That’s probably the biggest concern in terms of a pending recession: Companies are not ordering cardboard boxes to put their products in to then send to Target or Walmart for the holiday season.”


If looks could indicate

Americans have long sought to tease economic signals from fashion and style choices. It’s been said, for example, that skirt hemlines lengthen, natural roots start to show, men’s underwear goes unreplaced, and clothes grow more muted during an economic downturn.

It’s also been said, however, that many of those “indicators” are far from reliable. The hemline index in particular has been debunked **(11)** — midi skirts trended in 2019, for example, when economic conditions were otherwise solid, and micro-mini skirts trended around the time the dot-com bubble burst.


And it was Greenspan, again, who told NPR **(12)** that a dip in men’s underwear sales could be indicative of a troubled economy.

But is it?

“I cover Hanesbrands and Gildan, which both make underwear, and I can tell you that nobody at either company has ever told me that,” said David Swartz, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar.

“Greenspan was totally blindsided by the economic crisis in 2008, so clearly his underwear indicator did not help him, did it?” Swartz added.

During times of economic hardship, retailers may say consumers are becoming more “choiceful"" **(13)** or discerning in their purchases.

“It doesn’t mean that they don’t spend, it just means that they aren’t necessarily spending on things as they would if the economy was in better shape,” Swartz said.

The 'little treat' economy

A few months after the 9/11 attacks — at which point the US was already in a recession — Leonard Lauder, then the chairman of the Estée Lauder Companies, said ""when things get tough, women buy lipstick,” according to a Guardian report from the time. **(14)**

""In stressful times, many consumers are reaching out for those small indulgences that provide momentary pleasure,” Lauder said.

This sentiment started being referred to as the “Lipstick Index,” and it somewhat tracks with the idea of today’s “little treat economy,” or the rise of people indulging in more affordable pick-me-ups (an iced coffee, maybe, or a cute keychain) as a form of self-care.

“I don’t know that there’s any clear evidence that women decide to buy more lipstick because they feel bad about the economy or something like that,” Swartz said. “My opinion would be that when there’s a recession, people cut back on everything, and that probably includes lipstick.”

More indicative of economic conditions, perhaps, is whether or not people are going out to eat, which is generally more expensive than cooking at home. And restaurant traffic is indeed on the decline, **(15)** with the cost of food away from home up 3.9% in the past year. **(16)**


“You can also look at things like sales in discount versus sales in department stores,” Swartz said. “We’ve seen much stronger results from retailers like TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack and Ross compared to department stores. We’ve also seen weakness in the luxury space.”

Giant skeletons

Sean Bagniewski, a Democratic state representative in Iowa serving the Des Moines area, posited in a newsletter he sent in August that the apparent lackluster demand for giant, 12-foot skeleton sales at Home Depot could suggest economic rain clouds ahead.

He has his own “Skelly” and noted that “there are lively Facebook groups that focus on this and other Home Depot Halloween items each season.” Despite retailing for $299, they often sell out fast when they hit stores. And, since Home Depot (HD) did not do a spring sale of Halloween decorations this year, Bagniewski told Yahoo Finance, it seemed likely that August’s decoration drop would generate a lot of interest.

“Though I have one, I was curious to watch how the Skellies got snapped up when they were released at about 5:15 one morning earlier this month,” he wrote. **(17)** “In 2023, all of them were purchased within the hour. In 2024, all of them were gone by noon. This year, there were more than 3,000 that were still available on the Home Depot site 13 hours after they were released.”

“That’s not as fancy as Greenspan economics, but I’d say it’s interesting anecdotal evidence that folks are feeling a pinch in their pocketbooks,” he added.

A spokesperson for Home Depot said they couldn’t “share any sales specifics around any products,” though “we continue to see fans embracing Skelly into their Halloween collections.”

As of the morning of Sept. 23, Skellies remain in stock. **(18)** Indeed, some commenters noted in a Facebook group devoted to Home Depot’s Halloween products that they had tighter budgets this year or were waiting for discounts, though others spent thousands of dollars on decorations.

Still, Bagniewski sees red flags when families scale back on luxury items that make their kids happy.

“If people aren’t buying those — and it’s been a hot-ticket item in past years — then that should be somewhat of a warning sign,” Bagniewski said.

Powell also admitted the stock market looks pricey by historical standards, but kept a neutral tone.

Bowman, on the other hand, took a much more aggressive stance — saying the Fed should cut sooner to prevent job losses and layoffs from snowballing.

1noy49y,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 20:28:19,Crocs stock - value trap?,"Hey everyone! 

Long time lurker, and longer time value investor.

I’ve had a position in Crocs for some time now. Disappointed with the recent dip, but I believe the market has oversold pretty heavily. I’m considering adding to my already heavily allocated (as a % of my portfolio) position.

The company has been growing revenue and cash flow for quite a while now. They’ve been buying back shares and paying down the debt from the HeyDude acquisition aggressively. While the acquisition has panned out as a bit of a disappointment (see the recent impairment), it has undoubtedly taken the company to another level. They are forecasting revenue declines for the current quarter which hasn’t helped the stock price. 

All that being said, this company is selling at dirt cheap multiples. Even adjusting for the revenue decline, it will be one of the most undervalued cash flow streams in the market. The balance sheet is relatively healthy, and I’m expecting them to announce having purchased 2-3% of outstanding shares during this quarter - as the price is deflated.

They have shown significant international sales growth despite the slow down in the Americas. Their shoes are priced at some of the lowest levels versus most of their competitors AND they still get a higher margin than most of them. The management team has even advised part of the revenue decline is due to a pull back in promotions to preserve brand integrity. On the HeyDude side, revenue has been showing notable declines - although a bullish investor can attribute this to a shift in business model to drive D2C sales at higher margin than HeyDude’s wholesale strategy. 

I wanted to gather this community’s thoughts. Is their last report and this current quarter the start of the end? And therefore the market is pricing their stock accordingly? Or is this a true value play with blood in the streets and far too negative market sentiment for a historically great company (and one that still looks to be a good deal even if revenue declines over the next 5-10 years).

1nou72b,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 17:36:40,Thoughts on Target Corp-Possibly good ROE at these levels.,"Not an owner at present, looking for discussion from people who've looked at this stock before.

Obviously Retail is a mixed bag of margin compression and macro risk. Tariffs are the elephant in the room here.  Target has struggled way more than other big box retailers. However,  I think target is getting close to a good value oriented entry point here.  It is currently trading at less the 10x last year's stated free cash flow.  Previous years, with the exception of FY2023, see average comparable FCF yields.  I see them possibly upgrading their rewards program to drive more traffic.  Over the past ten years, they have bought back approx. 40 percent of their shares outstanding.  They have raised the dividend and have seemed resolved to keep it's dividend intact.  Also another factor here is the real estate porfolio within the overall stock price.  Including the real estate, the actual retail business of Target seems to be valued at very low valuation, if not, negative.  

Now what I'm saying here is not that Target is going make any gigantic headway in it's stock price, but I do believe it's possible for them to offer a decent return on equity through dividend and possible additional buyback opportunities via its cash flow.  I could see Target reclaiming its affordable chic mantel within the retail landscape.  

The only reason is even bring this up is I see Walmart, Costco, Amazon trading at fairly high multiples.  My curiosity is whether a retailer with maybe some more upscale exposure should be trading at literal fractions of a multiple lower.

1nopl2t,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 14:39:57,Will PayPal stock price explode?,"Hey everyone, 

Just wanted to get your feedback on my stock analysis of PayPal. 

PayPal does not need any introduction, it has been a major player in FinTech but has recently been challenged by the new competition landscape (Apple Pay, Google Wallet, Adyen...) and revenue growth has slowed to single digits which has brought the stock price down. 

Looking at their Business model, they make most of their money (around 90%) through transaction fees from Merchants and Consumers. With the world going digital with payments, this is a good model. Moreover, they will soon launch the PayPal World service which will interconnect the biggest payment schemes from Latin America(Mercado Pago), India (UPI), and China (WeChat). This last point gives them momentum to reach for new markets and expand their revenue growth. 

Taking into consideration their financials (from Yahoo Finance), PayPal has a Debt to Equity ratio of 60.25%, signaling healthy signs. Moreover, the forward P/E is 11.67, which is also low. Lastly, they are undergoing a big share buyback policy, which would ultimately bring share prices up. 

I haven't done any Discounted Cash Flow model to calculate the stock price, but looking at some analysis on Youtube, it seems like the intrinsic value of this stock is around USD 120. 

I personally think they are some good upsides with this stock and wanted to share that thought with you. If you would like to challenge that, please be my guest, I am looking forward to hearing your arguments.

1nopc6h,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 14:30:34,Beyond NVO and LLY: Expanding Your GLP-1 Portfolio,"I think everyone here knows about Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO), and if you believe the bull case for GLP-1’s I’m just going to assume you see a lot of value in both. Their GLP1 drugs treat one of the most common ailments on earth, and yet they are beaten down while the market is at all time highs. However, I’m not going to be making much of a bull case for GLP1’s here, others have done that. This post is about identifying lesser known companies that stand to benefit from the bull case for GLP1’s coming to fruition, as well as international markets. Here is what you need to know: 

The biggest news I really hope you know as a GLP1 investor is that semaglutide’s patents expire (all of them) next year in Canada, India, Brazil, Turkey, and Mexico. This has been well known for a while so it's not a huge drag on NVO or LLY, but we should all consider what generic GLP1’s hitting the market at the same time as orals next year will do. These two coinciding events could rapidly diminish the spooky novelty and price of these drugs, driving demand and adoption throughout the world. Next year will be pivotal, but this also raises the question, which companies are making the first truly affordable versions of these drugs?

First, this won’t be a market for just any generics maker, only those experienced in manufacturing biosimilar peptides and injectables will have a chance here, so it's not as zero-sum as some simple pressed pill generics market. The first mover will be the Swiss generics maker Sandoz (SDZNY) which plans to have generics on shelves in Canada by January at around $75 dollars a month (\~70% discount to current prices). That is the price of a nice gym membership. The other confirmed entrants in Canada will be Apotex (private), BIOCON.NS, and Dr. Reddy’s (RDY). Expect TEVA pharma and Viatris (VTRS) to enter later.  

I like SDZ quite a bit, price-to-sales of 2.4, forward P/E of 25. It’s up 45% this year but that's not ridiculous in this market. Here is some quick back of the napkin math: 

Current estimate is 2026 total revenue grows from 11B to 11.875B, 3%(300M) increase y/y from 2025 growth. Currently 1M Canadian GLP1 users, 4M total type 2 diabetics. Let’s say SDZ gets 500k of sales at $75 for 10 months of 2026, that is 375M of new revenue from just Canada GLP1’s next year. This is an extremely rough estimate, but I buy the general case of SDZ’s revenue from just GLP1’s next year being underestimated. 

RDY like SDZ is an experienced biosimilars manufacturer and has plans to aggressively enter all markets open to generics, especially its home market India. With a p/e of 18, p/s of 3, basically no debt and \~800M in cash RDY looks like a value play in an expensive market. If these drugs take off in these foreign markets this could be criminally undervalued. Now a bit more on these markets specifically:

Brazil is an underrated market, there are \~70-80M Brazilians who have private health insurance and make up a wealthier cohort who live very much like the average American. A study found this cohort’s life expectancy (83yrs) is actually higher. Of this privately insured cohort, \~14M are obese, and \~6M have type 2 diabetes. This is much larger than the Canadian market, and should be made up of fairly analogous market participants. There are, of course, the other 150M Brazilians as well. Consider [HYPE3.SA](http://HYPE3.SA) as a pure Brazil play, but SDZ, RDY, BIOCON, and TEVA will all be here as well.

Expect BIOCON, RDY, and SUN Pharmaceuticals to dominate an Indian market that while very large (70M-85M type 2 diabetics), will be extremely crowded, and frankly hard to gauge in terms of adoption. I want to buy BIOCON as they are an experienced exporter with a large Canadian presence, but I’ve had no luck doing so because there are no ADRs. 

A final note on generics, TEVA may win in the end at least revenue-wise. They are the generics giant, have the most know-how, and have quietly already got their foot in the door. Just a couple months ago they started making generic liraglutide in the US, an early GLP1 (not very good, so not a huge deal). This won’t impact their bottom line but it builds their GLP1 production capability for free, expect them to enter these markets aggressively, if you like the value here like I do, make it your top generics play.

Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) is a speculative play that I’m sure many of you have probably heard of. They make an oral that just completed phase 2 trials successfully, but the market hated the results due to high expectations. Personally, having read the study, I think it was blown out of proportion and it's valued nicely as a speculative play. I certainly like their drug better than Amgen’s or Metsera/Pfizer’s because it is an oral with genuinely good weight loss results already in phase 3 trials.

Telemedicine is the last obvious place to look here, the pick is LifeMD (LFMD).  NVO and LLY are never going to do business with HIMS again after the compounding issue, and HIMS cannot directly sell semaglutide or tirzepitide at all. LFMD has direct partnerships with both LLY and NVO and directly sells on their platform. Buy this as a fairly pure GLP1 play in telemedicine, and don’t worry too much about them getting sued, that's just a right of passage for telemedicine companies (seriously though). The valuation here is also just flat out good, 1.3 p/s (compared to HIMS’ 6.5) and analysts are rating it with serious upside right now. I may have buried the lede here as LFMD is arguably the purest GLP1 bull case play other than NVO and LLY and it is nice and beaten down, the red flags are the lawsuits and potential regulatory issues with telemedicine. 

A final note: NVO’s EVOKE Phase 3 Alzheimer’s/Dementia study will report results by the end of 2025, maybe any day now. Results will likely be middle of the road, if they are bad, well, we’ll take a hit with losing potential dementia treatment upside. But if results are good the sky might be the limit here, if GLP1’s can significantly treat obesity and Alzheimer’s with an oral pill… well you do the math. Get in or get out before these results drop. 

My GLP1 portfolio is about 35% LLY, 20% NVO, 15% LFMD, 10% TEVA, 10% SDZ, 5% RDY, and 5% VKTX. Good luck all.

Denison has four low cost uranium development projects which they have a range of interest, 22.5%, 25.17%, 70.55% interest, they include a mill, another mine, and some exploration.

As it stands, their balance sheet is solid having just received 333 million in cash bringing them to $721 million in cash, uranium and investments. They sold convertible notes in a capped call strategy, which means that investor can buy a certain number of shares up to $4.32 for the next 6 years with an annual coupon of 4.25% (way better for reducing stock dilution)

Their flagship project, Wheeler River, will develop two assets, an in situ recovery operation for onsite processing, and a convention underground mining operation with a milling toll at their 22.5% mill. The capital expenditure of this project is $429 million. It's a 16.5 year mine with an 11 month repayment and in IRR of 90%. Production is planned to startup mid 2028.

Not to mention a huge amount of the float and stock is owned by institutions.

All that is to say, I think the bull case for DNN is incredibly strong with current market and geopolitical context. Kazatomprom, the largest Uranium producer in the world is running into bottlenecks to keep up with demand.

I think there is strong potential for DNN to see a continued interest from investors. This kind of company with a $2.5 billion market cap is actually one that could be a lot higher. Cameco who operates in the region 37 billion. How quickly can Denison grow and further develop their balance sheet?

1non3ev,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 13:05:49,Is $BIRK the most undervalued stock in footwear?,"Hey r/valueinvesting. I thought I would do my first DD post. I've been expanding my horizons into consumer goods stocks lately.I am mainly a tech growth guy, but I may have found a gem with Birkenstock. Birkenstock is an iconic German footwear brand that has been around since 1774. Recently they've started selling boots, clogs, and have now dabbled into the skincare world. They went public in Oct. 2023 at $46/share and dipped post-IPO, but has been slowly climbing back. Now shares are trading around $45 with a market cap of 12 billion. With a P/E of 25, I'm seeing plenty of brand-recognition moat, growth, and consistent revenue growth. If you've stepped onto a college campus recently you may have noticed the explosion of sandals with Gen-Z. Since Birkenstock is the main brand of sandals, Gen Z should be coming back to keep buying for the rest of their lives.

* Revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 20% in the last few years, hitting 1.5B in FY2024. Net income margins are improving up to 10% thanks to their premium pricing and increase of efficiency. $BIRK has also expanded into the Asia-Pacific region and DTC now account for 40% of their sales, up from 30% pre-IPO.
* With 250 years of history, their products are positioned higher than a fast fashion trend. Average selling price is steadily increasing 5% per year.
* Forward P/E is currently at 19. Completely reasonable for a growth stock in consumer goods. If they are still on track to climb their revenue 20% this year, they will hit an EPS of $2.50.
* Birkenstock is aiming for 100+ new locations by 2027.

Their balance sheet is clean: EBITDA <1x, 300 million in free cash flow, with upcoming buybacks and dividends. I think $BIRK is screaming 'opportunity.'

The only downside I think is plausible is that they are not recession-proof. No one will buy $150 sandals in a recession. Overall, I still think $BIRK could be a great play over these next years.

1nom5ay,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 12:30:44,JP Morgan buy thesis on ASML,"From JP Morgan: ""TSMC has started to ramp up its 2nm process and this process ramp will continue in ’26 when their lead customer, Apple, is likely to start using this process. There have also been press reports yesterday that Nvidia is expected to be the first to adopt the upcoming A16 process at TMSC which will implement backside power. If these reports are true, then TSMC would need to ramp up significant capacity for A16 in ’27 (when it is likely to be in production). A16 will need 1 or 2 more EUV exposures than 2nm and thus will be particularly positive for ASML because of the increase in lithography intensity but more importantly because of the volume of wafer capacity that would need to be added if Nvidia were to start using the leading edge process (Nvidia has been using a process that is 1 or 2 generations behind the leading edge on its leading edge processors till now). TSMC would need to start preparing for Nvidia ramp in terms of orders and building capacity in 2H26 which would result in stronger orders/sales for ASML from TSMC in both ’26 but definitely in ’27.

HBM-related demand remains robust and memory pricing has not shown weakness. Indications have been that Samsung is possibly closer to qualification for HBM4 at Nvidia as well, which would be very positive for equipment shipments starting end of ’26 into ’27. Thus, risks that ASML guides to a weak ’26 are becoming much less likely in our opinion and ’27 trends will be strong (though not guided so soon by ASML). Importantly for the stock, once ASML guides to ’26 revenue range on October 15th, only ’27 will matter and though ASML will not guide to it, the market will speculate on positive trends and that should help the stock. ASML also continues to trade below prior average multiple of 30-35x and thus appears attractive. We reiterate that ASML remains our top pick in ‘25.""

Positive sell side reports have been a major catalyst for ASML over the last month. Coverage of ASML had become widely negative throughout '25. There are two bear theses which are related. The first is that litho intensity has peaked in terms of capex requirements to move to the next nodes. The second thesis is that high-NA won’t be adopted for a while as it is not economic. 

While TSMC didn’t introduce scaling at the N2 node as they moved to the new GAA transistor architecture (nanosheets), we should see scaling at the next one or even two nodes again—which will be a positive for ASML. On the second bear thesis, the positive is that high-NA is much more economic than EUV at its early introduction, as EUV’s uptime and productivity were extremely low. The technology had all sorts of problems and there were continuously bear theses flying around that the technology will never make it. The positive for ASML though is that even if high-NA gets delayed, more multiple patterning with EUV tools will be needed at the most advanced processing steps, which actually increases revenues and margins for ASML (high-NA is lower margin than EUV due to current low capacity levels).

So, the long term bull case for ASML is that:  

1. TSMC at its next one or two nodes will start scaling again, leading to increased EUV demand as more EUV process steps will be needed again.  

2. TSMC is building out three fab clusters—one in the US and two in Taiwan, where capacity requirements are increasing due to the boom in AI demand.  

3. DRAM is becoming more EUV intensive, due to the scaling roadmap.  AI is very DRAM intensive (HBM), boosting needed fab capacity.  

4. ASML has zero competition.

I'd add some charts here with further details but apparently Reddit doesn't allow this - anyways, more background on the current outlook in AI can be found here, which is an important driver for future  ASML tool orders:

- Zacks Investment Research have them as a Buy, and have published a bullish pro-Rolls article on Friday entitled:  “The Best AI Nuclear Energy Stock to Buy Not Named Oklo“ https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2754426/the-best-ai-nuclear-energy-stock-to-buy-not-named-oklo

- Goldman Sachs have initiated coverage of Rolls-Royce with a Buy rating, with a target of £12.90 /  $17.40  - recognising the turnaround story since covid, and the huge profit margin and FCF improvements in recent years.

- Citigroup have upgraded their price target to £14.40 / $19.44. (The difference appears to be that Citigroup have recognised how massively exciting the Nuclear Energy side of the business is, whereas Goldman haven’t even mentioned it.)

- JP. Morgan have also just identified Rolls-Royce as top 12-month picks, and them as capable of exceeding consensus earnings forecasts in the second half of 2025, placing them on Positive Catalyst Watch. https://www.reddit.com/r/RYCEY/s/mq1EpPz6Vv

- The vast majority of Wall Street analysts are rating Rolls-Royce as a Buy.


- Rolls Royce CEO was with US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the Windsor Castle Banquet last week. https://www.reddit.com/r/RYCEY/comments/1nk92wl/was_tufan_erginbilgic_at_the_uk_state_dinner/

- Nuclear energy stocks are roaring upwards, sending nuclear energy speculative stocks soaring despite being loss-making, and despite no revenues in some cases (OKLO!), so it’s only a matter of time before attention turns to a high-growth, cash-generative business like Rolls Royce, which keeps announcing new deals.

- Rolls-Royce won a £2,500,000,000 deal in June to build nuclear reactors in the United Kingdom. Last week, they’ve issued a statement on it welcoming in the “Golden Age” of nuclear energy. https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2025/15-09-2025-rr-welcomes-action-from-uk-and-us-governments-to-usher-in-new-golden-age-of-nuclear-energy.aspx

- Rolls-Royce builds and maintains the Nuclear reactors powering submarines.  They signed a £9,000,000,000 contract with the UK Ministry of Defence to provide long-term support for the existing fleet and future builds, securing its role in the UK's nuclear deterrent for decades to come.  More countries will look to sign similar deals. https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2025/24-01-2025-rolls-royce-signs-landmark-unity-contract-with-uk-ministry-of-defence.aspx

- Earlier in September, Rolls-Royce announced their involvement in providing reactors for Australia's new fleet of nuclear submarines, under the AUKUS defense agreement with the UK and US, further expanding its role in nuclear submarine technology: https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2025/10-09-2025-rr-signs-skills-and-technology-agreements-with-western-and-south-australian-governments-in-support-of-aukus.aspx

- Saudi Arabia Railways will be using more Rolls-Royce engines in their trains than before. Since 2012, there have been seventy 12V 4000 engines used in trains operated by Saudi Arabia Railways, and – having been impressed by their quality even in the harshest of conditions – Saudi Arabia have ordered an additional 50 trains with RR engines, as announced a month ago. A statement on the quality of their engines generally - beyond only in planes !   https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2025/21-08-2025-rr-to-supply-50-mtu-engines-for-high-speed-trains-in-saudi-arabia.aspx

- Rolls’s Power Systems division has received its largest ever Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) order, after Lithuanian energy supplier Ignitis selected Rolls-Royce to supply large-scale battery energy storage systems, in a huge deal announced last week. https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2025/16-09-2025-rr-biggest-battery-order-for-rolls-royce-large-scale-energy-storage-system-in-lithuania.aspx

Sure I’ve missed so many things there as all the many divisions of Rolls-Royce seems to be on turbo charge at the moment.

With aviation demand rising (and especially from Airbus more than Boeing),  with defence spending rising, and with the growing and desperate need for more sustainable energy solutions from nuclear, etc etc, it is inevitable that Rolls-Royce will be announcing more deals on all fronts in the coming weeks and months.
[…and it can only help to be having dinner with the Trump and Starmer last week!]

On this basis, I believe we will see £20 / $27 within the next 12 months =  70%+ higher than we are here.  And longer term it’ll be multiples of where it is today. And it is all backed up by real results - real revenues, real profit, and real deals worth billions.

I was looking at stock of German automobile companies and they stuck to me as 'cheap'. Case in point VOW with P/E of 3.34 dividend yield around 6% and cash of around 125 EUR/share (compared to price around 100).

I fully understand that the near term outlook is bleak due to German Auto industry playing catchup on EVs, Chinese taking over market share, weak general economy and US Tariffs. I also see that the balance sheet and cash flow is currently not very attractive. 

However, I do believe these companies have tremendous assets, 'too big to fail' and in the worst case, would be bought by a Chinese company or an American one (like Volvo). Also, we know that in general Auto is a cyclic industry which currently seems to be on the down.

Assuming I am looking at 10-15 year horizon with an aim to be slightly better than market, does it make sense to buy VW (or a bunch on German Auto shares to get some diversification within this niche)?

1no87m6,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 00:38:08,I have been knocking it out of the park with my results and...,"It is killing me. I try to explain to them what I have achieved and they listen politely and nod and at the end they say ""good work"" before they take the conversation in a 90 degree turn away from the topics of investing and me being awesome. 

I do searches such as asking google ""is 30% a good return on my investments?"" And then devour every scrap telling me how well I am doing. It conjures an image in my mind of someone(that would be me, I am the someone in my minds eye) masturbating while simultaneously they have stuck a hose from one of those pedal press bike pumps deep in the ear and the person(again, the person being spoken aboit here is me) rhythmically alternates between q stroke and a foot tap ad nauseum... stroke, foot tap, stroke, foot tap, stroke, foot tap, stroke, foot tap, stroke...  each action engorging a different body part, both stealing blood from the other temporarily in a struggle to engorge themselves. 

Sorry for that detour. Moving on, I remember the GFC and all the wealth that was wiped out and i remember feeling so bad for everyone affected by the situation... and then some years later I saw that all the wealth had come back and now new records were being smashed. This was when I started to research investing and more crucially, I explored the ideas that came to me from me and overtime I tweaked my ideas, I added components from other steategies, I poured over statistics, I read countless charts and over nearly a dozen years, I had come up with my own investment strategy. Since I first started my investment journey at the beginning of april last year I have refined my strategy, making it better and Dropping what didn't work. The most improvement has come from receiving validation of my methods via results and that has allowed me to use the conviction I now feel to more fully apply my strategy, where before I would sometimes hesitate and buckle (selling too soon, not buying when I should have).

Anyway, I wanted to post images but I dont have the requisite amount of karma so I will just type it out.

My total returns sit at 48.13%, annualised that works out 30.81.

At it's best it's gone as high as a total of 55% and annualised rate of returns of 40%.

I do not use, nor do I understand options, puts or calls. 

I'm not leveraged or using a margin call or whatever it's called. I use no debt whatsoever. 

Currently I have 3.68% in cash and 96.32% in stocks.

36.88% is in US stocks and 73.12% in AU stocks.

US stocks:

Total P/L (USD) 5,771.32

Total Profit (USD)+7,906.82

Total Loss (USD)-2.135.50

Win Rate 74.29% across 105 different posistions.

AU stocks:

Total P/L (AUD) 20,017.17

Total Profit (AUD)+24,112.73

Total Loss (AUD)-4,095.56

Win Rate 73.49% across 83 different positions. 

My Win Rates for both AU and US have both been as high as 80% in the past and are both at the lower end of the spectrum atm. 

I believe that I can see things that others are blind to, that I approach investing wildly different from most people. I regularly watch YouTube videos of people picking stocks and I am blown away by how differently we think and while on the topic of YouTube investors has anyone else noticed how rubbish these people are? I have not seen a single person, not one ever, EVER post a total profit/loss statement covering from start to finish.  

I ask these cringe inducing wankers to please post said total profit/loss and they respond with (what are you? My wife? I dont have to do nothing you tell me to do buddy"" or better still they just ignore me. We all know this is because they are all haemorrhaging money and are travelling through Loss Country. I have an idea for a YouTube channel that attacks these buffoons and posts advice on investing, but I have a unique idea regarding how it would be executed and generate revenue. 

I just realised I have been in a manic state for some time now and had better put a stop to this before it gets even more. Anyway, what do you guys all think of my results so far?

1no7n26,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 00:06:13,$RMCF - Not Financial Advice,"Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory (RMCF) is a ~$1.70 microcap that runs ~250+ chocolate shops/franchises plus wholesale/e-comm. They do around $30M in revenue annually, but the market cap is only -$4.8M net loss), but has started showing positive EBITDA in recent quarters and is rolling out a turnaround plan.

Why it’s interesting:
1. Valuation: Trades at ~0.4× sales - dirt cheap compared to branded specialty retail.
2. Brand footprint: 250+ locations, with new flagships opening (Chicago, Charleston).
3. Execution plan: New e-commerce platform, packaging rebrand, updated POS/ERP for franchisees, and cost discipline (pricing + SG&A).
4. Potential: If margins normalize (20–30% gross, 10–12% EBITDA), the stock has meaningful upside from this tiny base.


Valuation Scenarios:
1. Worst-case: Flat sales, weak margins, dilution → $0.00–$0.40/share.
2. Base case: Margins improve, EBITDA breakeven in 1-2 years → $2.50–$4.00/share.
3. Bull case: Strong margin expansion + brand growth, ~10× EBITDA → $5.00+/share.


Catalysts to watch:
1. Continued gross margin recovery toward 20–25%.
2. Successful rollout of new e-comm + branding.
3.Same-store sales growth + higher franchise royalties.
4. Operating leverage from POS/ERP deployment.
5. Franchise expansion momentum.


Bottom line:
This is a high-risk, asymmetric play - downside could wipe most of the equity, but if the turnaround sticks, upside is 2-3× (base) to 5× (bull). At $1.70, you’re basically paying less than the price of a candy bar for each share in a national chocolate brand.

1no64zm,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 22:48:39,The SMR Nuclear Renaissance seems to be a pipe dream being build on sand,"To get this out of the way, I am not anti-nuclear. I am however, struggling to understand how the economics make sense. I see a lot of posts and comments suggesting it is the only clean energy source that can provide growing baseload power, but the conversation rarely delves deeper than that. 

From what I've seen, the economic and logistical case for Small Modular Reactors seems to completely erode when looking at market data, historical project performance, and even fundamental physics. It looks to me like SMRs are not a viable solution for modern energy needs, as they seem economically uncompetitive, appear to be mirroring the nuclear industry's record of project failure, and could even exacerbate the unresolved problem of radioactive waste.

&nbsp;

**1: Costs:**

Data from Lazard's Levelized Cost of Energy analysis shows that unsubsidized utility-scale solar and onshore wind are the cheapest forms of new generation. 

- **Onshore wind** can have a levelized cost of energy as low as $27 per megawatt-hour, with a midpoint of $50.
- **Utility-scale solar** is similar, as low as $29 per megawatt-hour with a midpoint of $60. 
- **Gas combined** cycle plant has a midpoint cost of $77 per megawatt-hour. 

The only recent U.S. data point for new nuclear, Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4, has a realized cost of approximately $190 per megawatt-hour. So finances from out our most recent reactor build shows costs that are more than three times more expensive than new solar and wind. It doesn't seem like SMRs will be cheaper. The Department of Energy itself modeled a median cost per megawatt that was over 50% higher for SMRs than for large reactors

Even when you account for grid stability using a Levelized Full System Cost of Electricity model, the system cost for renewables in Texas is around $97 per megawatt-hour, which is nearly identical to nuclear at $96. This model assumes only 5% firm backup power, but the U.S. grid already has about 25% firm capacity from existing nuclear and hydropower, which makes this a pessimistic scenario for renewables. It seems likely that wind and solar are far cheaper than nuclear even when using this full system cost model.

&nbsp;

**2: Poor Track Record:**

 On top of this, the nuclear industry has a consistent, international record of severe budget and schedule overruns, which makes it hard to believe claims that SMRs will be delivered on time and on budget. 

For example, Plant Vogtle in the U.S. was originally estimated at $14 billion for completion in 2016 or 2017, but it was finally finished in 2023-2024 at a cost of around $35 billion. That's a 150% cost overrun and a seven-year delay. Ratepayers in Georgia will pay an extra $7.6 billion for it. Also, after completion, Vogtle Unit 3 was offline for 9.5 of its first 48 weeks. 

It's not just a U.S. problem either. The Flamanville-3 reactor in France began in 2007 with a €3.3 billion budget and a 2012 completion date, but it was finished in 2024 with a final cost of €13.2 billion - a 300% overrun and a twelve-year delay. An official audit even places the total cost at €19.1 billion. This pattern seems to be holding for existing SMRs. 

The world's only three operating SMRs, two in Russia and one in China, had cost overruns of 300% to 400%. An SMR in Argentina has a 700% cost overrun. China's first SMR took 12 years to build instead of the planned 4, and its second one is projected to cost twice as much per megawatt as a large reactor.

The flagship SMR project in the U.S., NuScale's Carbon Free Power Project, failed before construction even began because of unsustainable costs. It was terminated in November 2023 because its power was just too expensive for utilities to buy. The construction cost estimate for the 462 MW plant increased by 75%, from $5.3 billion in 2021 to $9.3 billion in 2023. 

The capital cost per kilowatt rose to over $20,000, which is comparable to the much larger Plant Vogtle. The target price for NuScale's electricity surged by 53%, from $58 per megawatt-hour to an unmarketable $89, and that was even with a $1.4 billion subsidy from the Department of Energy. 

Projections for other SMR designs look even worse. JP Morgan estimates some Western SMRs may cost $15 to $20 million per megawatt. Bill Gates estimated his 375 MW Natrium reactor would cost close to $10 billion, which is nearly $30 million per megawatt - double the per-megawatt cost of Vogtle.

&nbsp;

**3: Waste and Liabilities** 

Contrary to some of the marketing claims, it seems SMRs will actually produce significantly more radioactive waste per unit of energy than large reactors. A 2022 Stanford University study found that due to greater neutron leakage in small cores, SMRs will magnify the existing nuclear waste problem. The study suggests SMR designs will increase the total volume of nuclear waste requiring disposal by a factor of 2 to 30. They would also generate at least nine times more neutron-activated steel than conventional plants per unit of energy. On top of that, after 10,000 years, the radiotoxicity of the spent fuel from the SMRs studied would be at least 50% higher per unit of energy compared to conventional fuel.

This new, more complex waste would be added to a global stockpile of 400,000 metric tons of spent fuel, which is growing by over 11,000 tons annually, for which no country has a permanent disposal solution. The U.S. alone has over 88,500 metric tons of spent fuel stored at 75 sites across 33 states, and that number grows by 2,000 tons per year. There are other liabilities and risks to consider as well. Nuclear plants consume a lot of water, somewhere between 500 and 800 gallons per megawatt-hour. In contrast, solar PV uses only 2 to 20 gallons for cleaning, and wind turbines use virtually none. 

There are also massive unfunded cleanup costs. The global unfunded liability for decommissioning energy assets is $7.5 trillion. In the U.S., the failure to create a permanent waste repository has already cost taxpayers $5.3 billion in reimbursements to utilities for on-site storage, with future liability projected to be between $29 billion and $50 billion. Stranded assets from early plant closures could add another $60 billion in liabilities. The SMR supply chain also seems fragile and dependent on foreign nations. Over 90% of U.S. uranium fuel is imported, and there are no significant domestic suppliers for key materials like Hafnium, Niobium, and Nickel. 

Lastly, when you look at where major data centers are (Northern Virginia, Phoenix, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago), these aren't in the middle of nowhere; they are major urban areas. Do you think there won't be massive NIMBYism and regulatory efforts to halt small nuclear plants in these areas? 

&nbsp;

**4: I Just Dont get it**

When you look at the market, it seems SMRs are a non-competitive technology being outpaced by cheaper, faster, and more scalable solutions. From 2011 to 2021, the world added 56 gigawatts of nuclear capacity. In the single year of 2023, the world added 510 gigawatts of renewable capacity. For 2024, renewables accounted for 92.5% of all new global power capacity, and for 2025, solar, wind, and batteries represent 93% of planned U.S. utility-scale capacity additions. 0% is nuclear.

Nuclear's share of global power generation peaked at 17% in the mid-1990s and fell to 9.1% by 2024. If projections hold, solar will generate more electricity than nuclear by next year. Meanwhile things like advanced geothermal are projected to provide baseload power at a capital cost of $4,500 per kilowatt by 2030, eroding the nuclear is the only scalable renewable baseload argument.

NVIDIA is pumping $5 billion into Intel, sending the stock soaring while AMD's took a hit. For Intel, it's a desperately needed lifeline into the AI data centre space. For NVIDIA, it's a strategic hedge against relying solely on Taiwan's TSMC and a way to win political points with Washington. AMD is now caught in the crossfire, facing a new competitor attacking it on both the CPU and GPU fronts.

But this deal doesn't fix Intel's core problem: its grand plan to become a contract chip maker (a ""foundry"") is in deep trouble. The company's own SEC filings bluntly admit they have been ""unsuccessful to date in attracting significant customers"".

So, everything now hinges on one massive bet: their next-generation 18A manufacturing process. This tech is genuinely revolutionary, with new ""RibbonFET"" transistors and ""PowerVia"" backside power delivery that could, in theory, leapfrog TSMC's upcoming N2 node. Microsoft has given them a huge vote of confidence by signing on to use 18A, but the stakes couldn't be higher.

The bear case is terrifying: persistent rumours of alarmingly low manufacturing yields (some as low as 10%) could kill the entire strategy before it begins. Meanwhile, Intel is still bleeding market share to AMD in its core CPU business and is a distant third in the AI chip race, where NVIDIA's software moat is almost impossible to overcome.

My take? Investing in Intel today is a venture capital-style bet on a single, binary outcome. If they can execute flawlessly and get 18A working at scale by 2025, the stock is extraordinarily cheap. If they stumble, the decline could be terminal. It's a high-risk, high-reward play for the brave.

They own massive power infrastructure in Canada and Texas, the kind of stuff that’s really hard to replicate today.

Financials show ~$500m revenue last year, solid cash on hand, but also dilution and ~$1b in convertibles. On trailing numbers, valuation looks expensive. But if they can keep Bitcoin profitable and actually scale AI cloud with strong utilization, you’re basically looking at scarce infrastructure monetized by two megatrends.

Mark Spitznagel’s hedge fund has earned bonanzas in market collapses

This is an online version of Spencer’s Markets A.M. newsletter. Get investing insights in your inbox each weekday by signing up here—it’s free.

Plenty of fund managers will tell you they’re really bullish about stocks. Try finding one who says so yet stands to make a killing if prices collapse.

“I’m the crash guy—I remain the crash guy,” says Mark Spitznagel, who earned $1 billion in a single day for his clients during 2015’s “Flash Crash.” A protégé of “Black Swan” author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, his hedge fund, Universa Investments, also scored major gains when Lehman collapsed and when Covid-19 sparked a meltdown.

The alarming part of Spitznagel’s current outlook is that he sees conditions akin to 1929, the year of the Wall Street crash. The silver lining for those hoping the bull-market music will keep playing a while longer: He thinks this is more like the early part of 1929 when stocks added significantly to their Roaring ’20s gains.

How excited—or worried—should ordinary investors be? Take a deep breath and understand the way Spitznagel made those past killings. He wasn’t reading the tea leaves and predicting the timing of stock swoons. Even the smartest trader couldn’t know a pandemic or trading glitch was coming. Universa buys so-called tail-risk protection that loses money most of the time and then pays off hugely if a downturn is particularly sharp.

Other successful fund managers have drawn public attention with similar calls, and they occasionally get them right. In July 2024 Spitznagel himself sounded a similar tune, predicting “something really, really bad,” but with a last hurrah for stocks first. The S&P 500 has gained 23% since 

Market timing is notoriously difficult and often costly for individual investors who shift their portfolios on fearful headlines—something Spitznagel pointedly doesn’t recommend. Individuals who can’t buy sophisticated tail-risk protection will still make attractive returns in the long run as long as they can hang on. Many don’t.

“The biggest risk to investors isn’t the market—it’s themselves,” he says.

Timing aside, the euphoric and then cataclysmic scenario Spitznagel is describing could be good for his particular strategy. When investors are optimistic, his fund can purchase exotic tail-risk derivatives cheaply. His clients, mostly traditional investors such as pension funds, pay for protection so that they can more confidently reap the full benefit of rising markets.

The reason Spitznagel thinks the current bull market’s comeuppance could be the worst since 1929 is repeated federal rescues of markets and the economy. He compares it to the practice of quickly extinguishing forest fires only to have too much dry tinder accumulate. Amid today’s near-record stock valuations, the eventual “firebomb” could burn 

Before that happens, though, he calls conditions such as Federal Reserve rate cuts ideal for the market to push higher, with the S&P 500 hitting 8000 points fairly quickly. That would be a 20% gain from today’s level.

If a major selloff really is just over the horizon, big gains now wouldn’t be unusual. Since 1980, the S&P 500 has returned an impressive 26% annualized in the 12 months preceding the start of a bear market. The final 12 months’ rally was more than twice as high as that average ahead of the 1929 peak.

Both individual and professional investors tend to increase their stock exposure at times like today. Strategists at State Street noted last month that institutional investors’ exposure to equities just reached its highest since November 2007, just before a vicious bear market. American households’ allocation to stocks is also at a record, surpassing tech-bubble levels.

Two other signs that investors are throwing caution to the wind: The premium investors require to own investment-grade-rated bonds hit its lowest since 1998 on Friday and trading volume on U.S. stock exchanges was just shy of the April record during the Liberation Day panic.

“The markets are perverse,” says Spitznagel. “They exist to screw people.”

1nnmqwm,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 09:38:43,The great ammunition liquidation has ended (plus one more investment theme to start the week),"Note: formatting is much better on the website.

\---

# Theme 1: Ammunition Industry Pricing Power Returns After Historic 2025 Collapse

**News:** Kinetic Group, owner of Federal, CCI, Speer, Remington, and other major ammunition brands, announced substantial price increases of 3-12% across all ammunition categories effective October 1, 2025, citing rising costs of brass, lead, antimony, and propellants.

**Investment Thesis:** The first major ammunition price increase announcement signals the end of 2025's historic price collapse, creating margin recovery opportunities for manufacturers after months of unsustainable pricing.

The ammunition market experienced an unprecedented collapse throughout 2025, with 9mm rounds falling 75% from pandemic highs to just 20 cents per round, and current prices sitting 35% below pre-pandemic 2019 levels. This dramatic decline was driven by oversupply from pre-tariff imports, reduced post-election demand, and economic pressures on consumer spending.

Kinetic Group's announcement represents a fundamental shift in market dynamics. When the largest player in the ammunition market implements broad-based price increases, it typically sets the tone for industry-wide pricing adjustments. The company's rationale of rising raw material costs suggests that the artificial oversupply conditions are normalizing.

The timing creates additional advantages for manufacturers, as they can sell existing lower-cost inventory at higher prices while benefiting from the approaching hunting season demand. With warehouses currently full and retailers heavily discounting to clear inventory, this price increase signals that the liquidation phase may be ending.

**Stocks that would benefit:**

• `SWBI`: Smith & Wesson Brands Inc - While primarily known for firearms, Smith & Wesson has strategically diversified into ammunition production to capture more of the shooting sports ecosystem. The company is uniquely positioned to benefit from ammunition price normalization through both direct margin improvement in its ammunition segment and increased firearm sales as ammunition becomes more affordable, encouraging more frequent shooting and training. Smith & Wesson's vertically integrated business model allows it to capitalize on both sides of the market recovery, with its strong brand recognition driving consumer loyalty across product categories during this pricing inflection point. 

• `RGR`: Sturm, Ruger & Company Inc - As a pure-play firearms manufacturer with a debt-free balance sheet, Ruger stands to benefit significantly from the normalization of ammunition prices through increased firearm demand. When ammunition becomes more affordable, consumers typically increase their shooting activities, driving both new gun purchases and replacement cycles. Ruger's recent strategic product innovations, including versatile platforms like the RXM pistol and successful Marlin lever-action rifles, position the company to capture increased consumer spending as the ammunition price barrier to shooting sports participation decreases, directly supporting the pricing power recovery thesis. 

# Theme 2: EV Charging Infrastructure Gains Momentum from Wood Mackenzie's Bullish 12.3% Growth Forecast

**News:** Wood Mackenzie released comprehensive research projecting global EV charging ports will expand at a 12.3% compound annual growth rate from 2026 through 2040, reaching 206.6 million ports worldwide, with annual infrastructure investment growing 8% annually to $300 billion by 2040.

**Investment Thesis:** EV charging infrastructure companies are entering a sustained expansion cycle driven by improving utilization economics and U.S. market outperformance expectations of 14% annual growth through 2040.

The Wood Mackenzie forecast validates long-term business models across the charging ecosystem, particularly highlighting that the ratio of EVs to public chargers will improve from 7.5 vehicles per charger in 2025 to 14.2 in 2040. This utilization improvement directly addresses previous investor concerns about charging network economics and return on invested capital.

The U.S. market specifically is projected to outpace global growth, reaching 475,000 ports and generating $3.3 billion in annual market value by 2040. This domestic outperformance creates particular advantages for American-listed charging infrastructure companies.

Residential charging dominance continues with 133 million ports expected globally by 2040, representing two-thirds of all installations through 2050, supporting companies focused on Level 2 residential solutions alongside public fast-charging networks.

**Stocks that would benefit:**

• `EVGO`: EVgo Inc - Positioned as a pure-play beneficiary of the improving EV charging economics highlighted in the Wood Mackenzie forecast, particularly the projected increase in the ratio of EVs to public chargers from 7.5 to 14.2 by 2040. EVgo's strategic focus on high-power DC fast charging in urban and suburban locations directly aligns with the projected 14% annual growth in the U.S. market. The company's recent non-dilutive financing, including a $1.25 billion DOE loan and $225 million commercial bank facility, provides the capital needed to expand its public stall count to approximately 14,000 by 2029, capturing significant market share during this growth phase. EVgo's joint development of next-generation charging architecture with Delta Electronics, targeting a 30% reduction in gross CapEx per stall, further enhances its ability to benefit from the projected market expansion. 

• `BLNK`: Blink Charging Co - Uniquely positioned to capitalize on both the residential and commercial charging expansion projected in the Wood Mackenzie report through its vertically integrated business model. The company's strategic shift toward a higher-margin, recurring service revenue model emphasizes ownership and operation of charging assets, particularly DC fast chargers, which aligns perfectly with the forecast's emphasis on improving utilization economics. Blink's proprietary network technology and vertical integration capabilities enable it to enhance operational performance and improve station economics as the market expands. The company's recent 35% year-over-year growth in charging service revenue demonstrates increasing utilization and network expansion, directly supporting the thesis that charging economics will improve as EV adoption accelerates.

• `CHPT`: ChargePoint Holdings - Offers comprehensive charging solutions across residential, commercial, and fleet segments, making it a diversified play on the projected expansion across all charging environments. The company's software platform and hardware innovations are particularly well-positioned to benefit from the forecast's projection that residential charging will represent two-thirds of all installations through 2050. ChargePoint's strategic partnerships with companies like Eaton and General Motors accelerate product development and expand market reach, particularly for advanced energy management solutions like bidirectional charging. The company's record non-GAAP gross margin of 33% demonstrates improving economics that align with the Wood Mackenzie forecast's projection of better utilization rates and return on invested capital for charging infrastructure.

Been looking at Catalyst Pharma (CPRX) and ran it through my scoring model. Came out pretty strong (84/100). Quick breakdown: All data from stock analysis.com

What looks good:

Margins are insane → ~83% gross, 37% net. 

ROIC ~21% → solid efficiency.

Zero debt + $650m cash → balance sheet is rock solid.

Free cash flow margin ~49% → very rare for a small biotech.

EPS growth forecast ~26% over 5 years.

Analysts are bullish → avg PT around $33 (that’s ~+68% upside).

Patent protection on their main drug (Firdapse) extended until 2035.


What bothers me:

PEG ratio ~1.3 → not dirt cheap anymore.

Revenue growth forecast is only ~11% → not huge 🤔

Still heavily dependent on one drug → if anything goes wrong, revenue takes a hit.

Generic/legal risk always a cloud in pharma.

Execution risk with their newer drugs (AGAMREE, FYCOMPA).


My view:
CPRX feels like a proper cash cow with limited downside, but the growth story depends on them scaling beyond Firdapse. If there's no future successful drugs released, you’ve basically bought into a super profitable but not fast-growing rare-disease niche.

After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

⸻

Bottom line:
Japanese real estate small caps are a rare mix of hyper-growth, low valuations, insider ownership, and secular tailwinds.

1nnh3jp,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 04:40:37,The grain trader that’s hated right now (ADM),"I am talking about Archer Daniel Midland, one of the largest grain and soft commodity traders out there. This stock has taken a beating the last 2 years, when it had an investigation into accounting practices and suspended their CFO. Things have not looked good for their stock price since. However, their cashflows have been very solid in the last few years and this is why I suggest there might be value in this stock. As of today, the market cap is roughly 80 billion USD.

Firstly, their business model mainly consists of procurement, storage, blending and transportation of oilseeds and grains as well as crushing them into meal and oil products. These two pillars are accounting for two thirds of their profits. The rest is refinement and distribution of bulk and package food oils and biodiesel and a 22% ownership Wilmar that has a diversified portfolio and is accounted for at equity. Their processing plants are mainly in the US. According to CSI Market, their market share depending on the product is somewhere between 30-40%. Their operating margins however are quite low, since they are a trader and not a producer, they dont own the farm land. So you will see a low margin in their business and volatility in their earnings depending on the underlying price movements. Their moat is their sheer size and the cost efficiencies they can achieve compared to the competition.

From their financials, I think this company draws a different picture than their stock price suggests. Their operating cashflow has been massive in the latest quarter at 4 billion USD, which is very solid compared to total assets of around 50 billion USD. They generated good cashflow over the last 3 years with consistent quarterly cashflows in the region of 1-3 billion USD, the only quarter being negative back in March 2023.

Looking at the balance sheet, they do have liabilities (the business is capital intensive to some degree, to buy machinery etc.), but they have a very healthy level of equity. As for shares outstanding, they have constantly decreased over the last quarters as well as over the last 10 years, to me a good sign that you wont get diluted.

Overall, the cashflows can be a bit over the place and sensitive to macro events, i think this is still a player to keep in mind, given the discount the stock price has compared to a few years back.

Insider trades do give some mixed signals, since the CFO has sold some shares a few months back worth 1.3 MUSD (see below), but this does not have me worried too much.

For this analysis I used charts over the quarterly and annual financial results (balance sheet, income statement, cashflow statement and shares outstanding) that are official submissions to the SEC and i have obtained them through [www.Stock-Ticker-News.com](http://www.Stock-Ticker-News.com)

1nn08ij,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 14:52:51,$ALT. Many catalysts create a favorable risk/reward setup... (A Write Up),"**Disclosure:**  
First off, I want to be clear, I did use ChatGPT to help me reword and structure this write-up. **This is not “AI slop.”** I’ve done my own due diligence on $ALT, reviewed the trial data, filings, and peer comparisons. I merely used it as a tool for formatting and clarity. Also, **I do have a position in $ALT** and recommend you do your own due diligence before investing.

**Thesis**

Altimmune ($ALT) with its lead asset **permvidutide** is delivering on multiple ways in **obesity**, MASH (metabolic associated steatohepatitis), and liver disease. The recent 24-week data, non-invasive (NIT) improvements, regulatory developments, tolerability profile, obesity weight loss, recent management additions, and high short interest all create a short-term favorable risk/reward setup which should play out within the next year (when 48 week data releases end of this year/early next year). Also an **incredible opportunity for an acquisition**. 



**1. Mechanism & Design**

Pemvidutide is a GLP-1 / glucagon dual agonist engineered with Altimmune's EuPort domain. This deisng extends its half-life, reduces peak exposure, which enables therapeutic doses (1.2 mg, 1.8 mg) to be used without titration, improving usability for patients and physicians.

**(Simplified)** It's like Ozempic but built better - it lasts longer, its smoother on the body, and doesn't slow dose increases. 



**2. 24-Week MASH Data**

In the IMPACT Phase 2b trial, pemvidutide achieved MASH resolution without worsening fibrosis in       52-59% of patients vs \~19% placebo (p<0.0001). Fibrosis improvements trended positive (32-35% vs 25% placebo) but wasn't statistically significant at 24 weeks. 

**(Simplified)** After 6 months, more than half the patients had their liver disease clear up, compared to only 1 in 5 on placebo. Scarring wasn't improved enough yet, but it looks to be moving in the right direction. 



**3. Non-Invasive Tests (NITs)**

Significant improvements were seen on non-invasive fibrosis and liver-stiffness measures (VCTE, ELF), consistent with FDA's move to recognize VCTE as a ""reasonably likely"" surrogate endpoint. 

**(Simplified)** Scans and blood tests showed the drug was working. The FDA now says these kinds of scans can count as proof of a drug works.



**4. Weight Loss in the MASH Trial**  

At 24 weeks, pemvidutide delivered \~5-6% mean weight loss without titration, with body weight still declining at the last observation.

**(Simplified)** People lost about 5-6% of their body weight in 6 months - and they were still losing more when the study ended. 

  


**5. Safety & Tolerability** 

Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were <1% on pemvidutide, lower than placebo. EuPort design may contribute to reduced GI side effects.

**(Simplified)** Almost nobody quit because of side effects - actually fewer than those on placebo. 



**6. Obesity Program (MOMENTUM)**

In obesity, Phase 2, 2.4 mg pemvitutide produced 15.6% mean weight loss at 48 weeks with minimal titration. Lean mass loss was \~22% of weight lost, while visceral fat reduction was \~28%, outperforming subcutaneous loss and looking favorable vs other GLP-1s. 

**(Simplified)**  In a year-long obesity trial, patients lost about 16% of their weight. Most of that was fat, especially belly fat, and they kept more muscle compared to other weight-loss drugs. 

  


**7. Pipeline Expansion**  
Altimmune has initiated Phase 2 studies of pemvidutide in Alcohol Use Disorder (heavy drinking days) and Alchohol-Associated Liver Disease (endpoint: VCTE at 24 weeks). 

**(Simplified)** The drug is also being tested to help people drink less and to treat alcohol-related liver disease. 

  


**8. Valuation & Peer Context**  
Altimmune's valuation (\~$330M market cap, \~$170M EV) remains anomalously low compared with peers, especially following Roche's $2.4B acquistion of 89bio. 

**(Simplified)** Self explanatory...  




**9. Regulatory/Surrogate Endpoints**

FDA's acceptance of a Letter of Intent to qualify VCTE as the first non-invasive surrogate endpoint ""reasonably likely to predict benefit"" enhance the regulatory pathway for pemvidutide. 

**(Simplified)** The FDA now allows certain scans to be used as proof in trials, which makes Altimmune's results even more valuable. 

  


**10. Short Interest Details**

Shares sold short \~26.77 millions shares 

Short % of flat \~30.55-31.7%

This is high short interest. It means many are betting against ALT, which could amplify volatility around catalysts like data readouts, regulatory decisions, earnings. 

  


**11. New Management**

Altimmune appointed Linda M. Richardson as Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), effective September 16, 2025. Richardson brings over 30 years of commerical leadership across metabolic disease, hepatology, cardiovascular, and addiction medicine, with prior C-suite experience at Intercept and senior roles at Sanofi. The timing of this is pivotal 48-week MASH data readout and Phase 3 planning and signals that Altimmune is preparing for commercial execution. Hiring a CCO at this stage suggests confidence in trial outcomes, intent to scale infrastructure for Phase 3, and a focus on market access and launch strategy. 

  
Hope you all enjoyed and recommend you do your own DD before making any financial decision.

Often when a company is unprofitable, the stock looks insanely overvalued on traditional metrics. But *IF* it has a clear path to profitability it might be a good buy. As once profits start coming in, suddenly valuation looks “reasonable.” Therefore the stock rerates higher.

**Examples:**

* PLTR
* HIMS
* UBER
* CVNA
* HOOD
* SOFI
* SHOP
* (and probably more)

All were ""expensive"" when the stock was unprofitable. But after profitability they got rerated higher.

Obviously most unprofitable companies never make it and burn capital forever. **That's why I believe if I were to bet on an unprofitable company it'll be software companies.** As they're highly scalable and are the most likely to do a profitability turnaround. And they're profits need to be heading up.

One can say they’re just looking for good deals in the market. Either by ownership, or lending. They understand that the market is valued correctly in the long term, hence in the short term there are discrepancies, or gaps in the market, that they can take advantage of in many shapes or form. But there are two main components that play a key role.


The price the investor buys at, and the value they approximately predict of the security they are buying. Typically the intrinsic value, the bet on future earnings based on the assets tangible and intangible of the present. The assets a business owns will be the primary driver of growth and earnings, and an investor main goal is to find securities that have assets that provide strong earning powers in the future. This is the value, now in the short term, investor sentiment, aka the optimism or pessimism of “Mr. Market” is in constant fluctuations. So the intrinsic value and the present day price of the security often do not correspond. And some are seriously undervalued, those provide a margin of safety, with a significant discount rate. This is the ideal security an investor wants and hunts for.",2,4,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nln59x/why_value_investing_is_fundamentally_market_price/,new,Discussion,0.75

Is it value investing to invest in unorthodox companies that are surviving crisis, bankruptcy, restructuration, and very shaky past ?  
  
In Brazil there are some companies that although are or were in huge crisis, they have some good value, like:

* Light Company: It's the electrical company of Rio de Janeiro, it was in our Chapter 11 and judicial recovery, it had a huge debt, it's also well known in the market that 60% of the energy generated and transmitted by the company is hotwired and stolen by the inhabitants, pratically they are a joke amongst the people. Nevertheless, today they are in a very better situation, their leverage is good compared to other electrical companies, they have some good cash flow, big shots of the market investing, Small P/E, and the energy supply of the entire Rio de Janeiro State, but the market is still undervaluing the stock. 
* Lojas Americanas: It's our Dollar General, and punchline of hundreds of jokes amongst the population, due to it's recent fraud scandal, judicial recovery, litigations, stories of shoplifting, etc However the owners (3g Capital of AbInbev, BurgerKing) were forced to captalize and save the company. today the company is still recovering, but there is some potential like: personal intervention of the owners (Mr Sicupira, Lemann and Telles), small debt, huge capital injection, a reducing loss, and it's huge presence in Brazil's Retail and logistics, that still provide them competitive advantage in the sale of snacks, underwear, electronics, alongside digital presence, and a possibility of interest rate reducing in the future. Although the company is a meme stock in the stock market.
* Magalu: it's our Best Buy+IKEA, and the main Amazon + Mercado Livre rival in the country, it was in a bad shape last years, it also got in trouble with our basic interest rate, and debt, it's stock plummeted. However it seems to be back on the track, they are recovering from losses, their debt is also reduced, they have huge cash flow, are a HUGE brand in the market, their logistics is second to none, they are also undervalued in regards to their equity, and believe or not the company is diversifying in the cloud sector.

1nl8pby,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 12:45:00,I believe this is the most future proof mine I've ever found,"
Alright listen up gang, I’ve found a beat down stock but what I think is a sure hit for mid to long term investors.  FPX nickel is building the largest nickel mine in north American, top 10 in the world.

To break this down, here’s a few of the key bull points

-The ore does not require acid extraction, it uses magnets (fucken magnets, how do they work?)

-The ore type means is low carbon footprint, low tailings, and low metallurgical cost, it’s a simple extraction method. Low carbon is favorable as  future proofed mine. The capital cost per extraction is quite ideal

-it’s in BC Canada which is favorable for mining, good port access and intercontinental sales

-It can be processed as either high grade nickel for stainless steel, or pushed to battery grade nickel sulphate

-They received $3.5 million CAD from the Canadian government to support construction. This is not a loan, literally just free money to the company

-They have three separate companies who all have bought a share in FPX and all the company’s have a cost basis of around 40 to 50 cents (share price is 30 cents now)

-They have preliminary agreements with Toyota and panasonic, Japan’s metal and energy security agency, and Prime planet energy & solutions to supply materials for EV construction (non binding). These will align the industries for future partnerships, funding agreements, and general support overseas

-It’s mine life is 29 years.
 
What’s the downside and risk?
It’s early stages, Environmental assessments have been happening since 2022, but permitting might take as long as 2027. Nickel might not be sold until as late as 2030


So with that said, this is a long term investment. Dont expect fast returns and big moves soon, but for the patient investor, this could really pay off

1nkz7ha,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 05:46:57,"Malibu Life Holdings (LON:MLHL) Trading at Huge Discount. Price $20, Book $33+.","Malibu Life Holdings (LON:MLHL) used to be that Third Point Investors Limited was just one of those London-listed closed end funds that gave you exposure to Dan Loeb’s hedge fund strategy via a feeder structure. It traded at a persistent discount to its net asset value, leaving a lot of investors frustrated. Recently, it pivoted with a reverse takeover and transformed itself into an operating reinsurer focused on US fixed annuities. That’s the change. The upcoming opportunity lies in how that restructured business can begin to deliver growth, profits, and get re-rated by the market.

As of now, the volume of shares traded have taken a nosedive since the reverse take over given the reassessment taking place by all institution investors. Furthermore, the company has yet to release it's first quarterly and annual reports since the merger, however, based on the financials reported during the reverse takeover, we can work somethings out. In addition to this, liquidity has also been impacted by the scheduled redemption of 4.38 million shares on 19 September 2025, with initial cash consideration paid that day. After the redemption the free float drops to roughly 17 million shares, which has further thinned day-to-day volumes and made price discovery more volatile. The redemption also took place at a slight discount, meaning the NAV per share should slightly tick up, but we can ignore that bit for now.

The latest numbers tell us that the reference NAV per ordinary share is about \~$33 as of the last disclosure date. The company’s share price is currently trading near $20-21 depending on market moves. The tangible book value of Malibu Life Reinsurance (the acquired business) is roughly US$65-68 million. However, since this was an NAV-to-NAV deal, this won't impact the PB per share.

Putting those together, the implied book value (NAV) per share is $33, while the market is paying around $20. That means the shares are trading at about a 40-45% discount to book value (or NAV). That is a large margin of safety if the book value is sound, and if the reinsurance business can begin to show results.

Risks remain. Execution risk is high: building up premium volume, managing reserves, ensuring profitability in the reinsurance of US fixed annuities is not trivial. Regulatory risk exists if oversight or capital requirements change. There is also the possibility the discount persists or widens if the market is skeptical of management, of the reinsurance strategy, or if early operating results are weak. Liquidity and investor sentiment matter.

Assuming the business executes reasonably well, sells enough treaties or annuity blocks, and begins to deliver mid-teens returns on equity (the stated target), one can model a re-rating of the share price over a 1-2 year horizon. If today’s NAV is \~$33 and the market is paying \~$20, the discount will need to narrow substantially for the share price to catch up. If discount narrows to, say, 10-15%, that alone gives \~25-30% upside (to \~$28-30). Add in NAV growth from earnings (assuming 10-15% ROE, growth in premium base, operational leverage) and you might see NAV rise to perhaps \~$36-40 in 12-24 months.

1nktyc7,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 00:24:14,Is it too late or too soon to get in NVO + Googl party ?,"Hi Fellow investors, i've been targeting **NovoNordisk** and **Google** for sometime from the deep dive of the stocks and repeated mentions in the sub, but i'm still in doubt whether i invest or not on these companies since:

* I'm relatively a newborn in stockmarket and value investing, effectively starting in late september of last year. And i started very bad, investing on **NVDA** bubble and quitting once i got the opportunity, and i learned more about the market,  fundamental attributes, fundamental analysis.
* I'm in a very *sui generis* market, the brazilian one, where the stock market is underinvested and a bit smaller than the american one, the investors are either too skeptical or too optimistical, with elephant companies with very low P/E ratio, healthy finances and big fat dividends (like 15% in some banks, oil, mining).
* Since NVDA i've been building a small portifolio, following the principles of: absolute frugality in the stock price (small P/E like Vale and Petrobras), very good growth prospects, no bubbles nor Rallies, undervalued good companies (like Oil, Insurance, Banks), that suffered devaluation due to market rumors, bad season and the infamous tariffs.
* I avoided to buy NVO, due to lack of time to study, fear of catching a falling Knive, the targeting of Ozempic Patents by brazilian and world pharma (lots of companies are crazy to make their own, it's going to be a fever here, unfortunately lots of the producers are private)
* I also avoided Google, due to the worsening of the flagship product (search platform), bullish approach to AI, the fierce competion in cloud providers, the insane approach of US government, the recession on the radar, and a P/E of 25
* Nonetheless, NVO is starting to get impulse and is a nice company to invest (their brand is differential).
* And Google even though i disagree with some choices, they have Youtube (This itself is a huge product, a monopoly), Google, Waymo, GCP, and strong R&D

A rally is forming about these two companies, in a market that is craving to buy the deep and is almost bubble generator,  
And i'm thinking about getting a few shares of NVO and GOOGL, but i'm afraid of paying a very expensive price, what's the best approach to this case ?

Now the stock has run up a lot, and I need capital to fund my recent fortinet buys. Fortinet for those who don’t know is a cyber security company with an average of 9% return on invested capital. They are shifting their business to a service based cyber security company (although 40% of their revenue is hardware) they trade at a forward pe of 31 times and have historically grown their revenues at 20%, and analysts are forecasting 12-13% revenue growth (so inline with the sector average). What I have noticed is they usually give conservative guidance on how much they expect to grow, and I have them doing 15% revenue growth over the next 5 years on average. I have calculated fair value to be roughly around 85-90 dollars, and I consider Fortinet to be a wonderful business.

## CONCLUSION & VERIFICATION SUMMARY

### Macro Regime Classification
**Primary Regime:** TRANSITIONING (EXPANSION → SLOWDOWN)
**Confidence Level:** HIGH
**Expected Duration:** 6-9 months
**Key Supporting Evidence:**
1. Fed pivot to easing with first rate cut
2. Labor market deterioration (NFP miss, rising unemployment)
3. Yield curve normalization after extended inversion

### Executive Summary
**One-Line Synthesis:** The macro environment is transitioning from late-cycle expansion to early slowdown, with the Fed initiating an easing cycle that should provide selective opportunities in duration and quality risk assets while warranting caution on cyclical exposures.

### Highest Conviction Calls

1. **Long Investment Grade Bonds**
   - Supporting data: 4%+ yields with Fed easing, tight spreads
   - Implementation: Overweight IG via LQD or individual bonds
   - Risk: Spread widening if recession materializes

2. **Overweight Quality Growth Equities**
   - Supporting data: Rate cuts historically benefit growth, strong fundamentals
   - Implementation: Technology and healthcare sector ETFs
   - Risk: Valuation compression if rates rise unexpectedly

3. **Reduce Cyclical Exposure**
   - Supporting data: ISM <50, weak NFP, global growth concerns
   - Implementation: Underweight energy, materials, industrials
   - Risk: Positive economic surprise could cause underperformance

### Key Risks to Monitor
1. **Inflation reacceleration:** Trigger at CPI >3.5%, currently at 2.9%
2. **Credit event:** Trigger at HY spreads >450bps, currently at 283bps
3. **Labor market breakdown:** Trigger at unemployment >4.5%, currently at 4.3%

### Next Update Requirements
- **Scheduled Update:** October 18, 2025
- **Conditional Update:** If Fed makes inter-meeting move or CPI >3.5%
- **Emergency Update:** If VIX >30 or credit spreads blow out >100bps

Fundamentals (Ok - kinda solid): Good balance sheet (solid liquidity ratios + recovering solvency such as debt ratios), not great but ok looking income statement (EBITDA&net profit margin still trying to recover + still decreasing ROIC and ROE but still solid numbers), Cashflow statement doesn't look too great but I can see they are (1. laying low on CAPEX just maintaining and not investing into PPE; 2. Paying back shareholders) - exactly what a mature stage company should do. So overall, the fundamentals don't look bad to me.

2. Overarching Headwind (Nothing to be feared): I think this headwind is nothing to be feared as its gonna pass. People needs their stuff shipped, simple as that. And the orange king won't be in power forever. ( so I have AMZN + FDX shares & sold puts on UPS)

3. Valuation: A solid business trading at 13x earnings is a no brainer to me.

My execution: I started a position with 10% of my NAV and plans to hold if it goes up or convert half into LEAPS if the earnings blew up.

TLDR - AI's leveling the playing field, removes some of the time intensive research that goes into investing.

The Golden Age of Value Investing Is Over

It used to take hard work and an ear for scuttlebutt to gain an edge, but now AI has leveled the playing field. Is that a bad thing? 

For 30 years, my advantage as an investor was painstaking research. AI just made it worthless.
In 1995, I read two books that changed my life: Benjamin Graham’s The Intelligent Investor and Roger Lowenstein’s biography of Warren Buffett. I was hooked on value investing. I could not get enough of it. In those days, however, getting enough of it was hard. It was the infancy of the internet, so it wasn’t as if I could just Google “Warren Buffett” or “value investing.”


The first thing I could get my hands on was Berkshire Hathaway’s annual report. I had to look up the phone number in the phone directory. After that, I placed a phone call using a landline. A nice lady with a Midwestern accent picked up the phone, “Berkshire Hathaway — how can I help you?”


“Hello,” I said. “I’d like to order a copy of your annual report.” That’ll be no problem, came the answer. I gave her my mailing address, and she repeated it back to me. A few days later, I received a brown envelope with the annual report. I devoured it. And I used the table of Berkshire’s publicly traded investments to go after new materials — the reports of Coca-Cola, Geico, American Express and Capital Cities/ABC — in a similar fashion, by picking up a landline phone and making a verbal request.
What’s my point?


Things went slowly. Acquiring knowledge was hard. Every step in the acquisition of investing knowledge involved a cycle of days, if not weeks. The various pieces had to be carefully assembled and assiduously harvested.


From those early days, I learned about the Berkshire Hathaway meetings. They were not recorded for YouTube or televised live. So, I acquired some shares and attended them in person. All in pursuit of an investing edge. Yes — there were a few lucky non-attendees of those meetings who managed to get onto Whitney Tilson’s famous email list — which at the time numbered dozens at most. But that was it. The inside tracks were few and far between.
Because I could not get enough, I also attended the Wesco meetings in Pasadena, California with Charlie Munger, and the Sequoia Fund meetings run by Bill Ruane and Rick Cunniff. Once at the Wesco meeting, Munger mentioned the Tupperware company in the context of Robert Cialdini’s Influence:The Psychology of Persuasion. I was on it. I even organized a Tupperware party in my home to understand how the company’s sales system worked.


In those days, potential investors in my fund used to ask, “What’s your edge?” Perhaps it was a shorthand for “Do you have a source of inside information?” Or, more politely, “What’s your variant insight?” If I had any at all, it was based on this sort of scuttlebutt.
But that world is now gone.


Over the last decade many of those advantages have been eroded. Pounding the pavement, smiling and dialing were no longer necessary. Because those hard-earned insights were being emailed, tweeted, livestreamed, YouTubed, podcasted and more. Yes, you still had to pick your sources. But there was so much more that was simply available at the tips of any analyst’s fingers.


And now comes AI. The way investment research changed in the internet age was glacially slow when compared to the earthquake that is LLMs. Before ChatGPT, you still had to have the patience to assemble and read through the mosaic of sources. Now you can just ask ChatGPT or Gemini to do all the trawling. An LLM can give an instant summary of all that has been said in the public domain about a company. And it can be instantly analyzed to provide the current state of wisdom on the topic.
Granted, the LLMs cannot, to the best of my knowledge, generate original thinking. But the path to original thoughts is so much shorter — and so much more accessible.


In past times, I used to make a point of traveling to the Kings Road in London on the off chance that Nick Sleep and Qais Zakaria of Nomad might treat me to a Cornish pasty along with some of their original thoughts. It was there that I first heard Nick talk about “scale economies shared.” Today there is no need for me to travel all that distance — unless I am only after the Cornish pasty and Nick and Zak’s fine company.


Why? So many original thoughts or variant opinions are available online and the LLMs can trawl through all of them — adding in and cross-referencing a mosaic of additional sources: social media posts, SEC filings and more. That material is all now public domain.


It’s true that there are still many nonpublic data sources that are not accessible by LLMs. But data tends to leak out via Scribd, Reddit, arXiv or social media. Even if that’s just metadata, it can be assembled effortlessly. Then a human like me can apply intuition and fact-check the sources to make sure the LLM is not hallucinating.


What does this mean for value investing?
My conclusion is that the golden age of value investing is well and truly over. Thanks to the LLMs, I have no need for a junior analyst: At a fraction of the cost, an LLM can do a far better job. And the era of the swashbuckling hedge fund manager — Michael Steinhardt, George Soros, Julian Robertson — is also gone.


Asset pricing will become more accurate. Hidden subtleties about a particular business that make it either better or worse than it appears will be more easily revealed. The return on better analysis and better insight will diminish because it will be available to all. The British scientist and writer Matt Ridley would liken this to the Red Queen effect: We can all run faster, but at the end of the day, we will all have access to the same LLMs. The dispersion of returns for active management has to reduce, clustering even closer to the index return, even for investors who don’t closet index.


People used to ask, “What’s your edge?”, but there is no edge anymore. At least, none that is obvious to me.


Where, then, will money flow? What remains are index funds and asset-gatherers like BlackRock. And what of small, independent boutique funds like mine? We can stick to human behaviors that work — which the indexers and the quant funds with their large organizations and programmed behavior cannot replicate. We can buy and hold, which is sometimes called time arbitrage.


I will certainly continue to invest in scuttlebutt, LLM channel checks, expert calls and the like. But I know that it will probably be futile. Because everyone can do it. I expect my attention to turn to building the best set of relationships, and to invest in businesses that themselves invest in better sets of relationships.
For this I can think of no better example than Berkshire Hathaway - with its vast number of shareholders. That's a large group who have the lived experience that buying and holding for the long term, rather than chopping and changing, is the way to invest. That will give Buffett's successor, Greg Abel, a far better environment to allocate capital - just as my investor base should afford me the same. I know it's slim pickings, but it should be enough for those of us who remain.


If the only thing AI and LLM's do for finance is to level the playing field - to further marginalize the masters of the universe (and wannabees like me) - would that be such a bad thing? Most likely not.


Thanks to AI, the playing field is more level than it's ever been. Now more than ever there is no need for the average investor to have to pay outrageous fees. A big benefit of the stock market was democratize finance. Perhaps, now, thanks to AI, that day is finally here.",80,76,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkmlfe/the_golden_age_of_value_investing_is_over_guy/,new,Discussion,0.9
1nkmjao,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 18:33:13,Analysis of IREN - second update,"Hi everyone,



Some of you might remember [my previous discussion about IREN when it was trading at $18 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1mnyhsk/analysis_of_iren_an_undervalue_company_for_now/)a month ago. With recent price movements, I wanted to share an updated analysis and get your perspectives.

Current snapshot (Sept 18, 2025):

* Trading at $36.60
* Market cap: $9.968B

**My 2026 Projections:**

Looking at their monthly reports from January through August 2025, I'm conservatively estimating they'll generate $60M in hardware profit monthly starting January 2026.

Annual gross hardware profit: 12 × $60M = $720M

They're targeting $200-250M in GPU service revenue annually. While no contracts are announced yet, partnerships seem likely based on recent industry trends. Assuming 10% for electricity and operating costs:

Annual gross GPU service profit: $180-225M

Total gross annual profit: $900-945M

**Scenario Analysis:**

**Scenario 1: BTC around $115,000**

Converting gross profit to net income (after all costs, taxes, depreciation, etc.):

1. Conservative (20% conversion):
   * Annual net income = $900-945M × 0.2 = $180-189M
   * P/E = $9,968M ÷ $180-189M = 53-55
2. Historical basis (30%, based on FY25 Net/EBITDA ratio of 31.2%):
   * Annual net income = $900-945M × 0.3 = $270-283M
   * P/E = $9,968M ÷ $270-283M = 35-40
3. Base case (40% conversion):
   * Annual net income = $900-945M × 0.4 = $360-378M
   * P/E = $9,968M ÷ $360-378M = 26-28
4. Aggressive (60% conversion):
   * Annual net income = $900-945M × 0.6 = $540-567M
   * P/E = $9,968M ÷ $540-567M = 18-19

**Scenario 2: BTC around $150,000 (30% increase)**

Total gross profit increases to \~$1,160M

1. Conservative (20%): Net income = $1,160M × 0.2 = $232M, P/E = 43
2. Historical (30%): Net income = $1,160M × 0.3 = $348M, P/E = 29
3. Base case (40%): Net income = $1,160M × 0.4 = $464M, P/E = 22
4. Aggressive (60%): Net income = $1,160M × 0.6 = $696M, P/E = 14

**My Take:**

Given the current macro environment with declining interest rates, I conservatively assume Scenario 1, case 3 as the worst case. This gives us a P/E of 26-28 at today's price. For a tech company with solid assets and strong positioning in growing sectors, this seems like reasonable value.

1nkmaru,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 18:23:15,Merger Arb Opportunity - DALN,"DALN has a deal on the table to be bought for $16.50, it closed at $15.37 today. On paper thats a return of a little over 7% on a deal that should close fairly quickly, maybe 6 months-ish?. Of course like most things, its not that simple. There is a slim possibility of a higher bid, and a small possibility the deal is rejected by shareholders mad that they couldn't get a higher bid.

The one reason not to recommend it is the balance sheet is weak, and its lost money most recent years, so if the deal does fall through the downside is very real. But I discount that risk because of the other bidder.

Following is some excerpts from the always excellent Matt Levine's column that gives the lay of the land on this deal.

The price was $14 per share in cash, “a premium of 219% based on the closing price of DallasNews’ common stock of $4.39 per share on July 9, 2025,” and more importantly...

Two weeks later, MediaNews Group, a newspaper company owned by Alden Global Capital, [lobbed in a bid](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/6bA2YQDFmxaQSpA33W5Y7fnHL0uTmSpA6jX91xUeCGV8ftAOUigORl2cW7yBMnPaBruiTSNfGXutOlrcrC0-cjmxcyCD9cTGbko6VCDlnGfwltBwGP6UnYBRGe2rMdxkc3f0pvguBvB4pa7g2mfaumVikLGRDkxFE0OZPREdFWjUeIKchYLAE_K4RvN248oRkeuvlaO9nWJzh3SMW0hYMHRgjcW5fSyvT3kLN-pYgK71hWS1o5KQ0_DNOxdJ3ePtOj7DteuNDIShuQXTrtIESSmFyaNSFDnzaTNqfCoJK3DkkKR6vAplDv57D_vtPXJ--tQKAECHo2i0lY1u3zcVZvrEGN0b8ahO9gFfwYxS1cg-NOvOxZsJTsl4yGU/sP8sI0VFOvrR5R8bYJyFXNug_ayOARfP/12) at $16.50.

But the basic situation hasn’t changed. The Alden deal would clearly be better for shareholder value — $20 is more than $16.50 — but Decherd thinks it would be worse for journalism, and he gets to say no. “Having retired from the Board in September 2023 and having had no formal role related to the Company since then, I have no fiduciary responsibility,” [he told the board](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/f46EHZDyrSMPIT_uO260nZr-k_w0MsCReINf5ePd3DX7ZIvSCHXfEe9GM26C8ZN-EVbK6kFjcIifxW7SKs957ZBkFSiR1AraDzCmYivZF4moT8kMnNDMLXw4Uy03YFpXsTd4W7EUUBGcXfjsPdv6aVEP-kk4_UQih6XVxNxvLshYcfNsOlhqy-X4aDqWDyCDq37mntS5HZffcIGOS1mpLe3fpjtiTj7z71nZxfq4AXp0mOpgUZcP4bGhj2oELkyppIGdfe_s6UtB5tb1AwgvpJ8tnasWjjC0QaG8II_clYJ9cr8QzelkAZQrxBk_YgHeR5KLLFb_VMZiR8cQjJ2SXVLiIhDvNi7eVnhJyuoYrsWr0UEn7fiTKp30a8Y/347KtJCaauCp6KmXWEpN3bRkwCb6JI10/12): He doesn’t have to maximize shareholder value.[\[4\]](x-webdoc://4A216BF9-A9A1-4D4F-8C93-27674C55069B#footnote-4) He’s a yes on Hearst and a no on Alden, so there’s no Alden deal.

That doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a Hearst deal. The awkward fact is that, to get any merger done, the company needs the approval of two-thirds of the regular, low-voting shares; Decherd only owns 1.6% of those. Presumably most of the public shareholders care more about the extra $3.50 than they do about Decherd’s journalistic preferences. They don’t get to vote on the $20 Alden deal; they only get to vote on the $16.50 Hearst one. They *could* vote against it, but DallasNews [has said that](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/6CEdb6B4Ppu-EYv7BrC2nECV7L2MR97Vflhc7DPhzGtTPmOA7_fvVMeNYavmMHwE2aUKFDQ4zjrwWa8D_3J5n-MjJFcpy3Yz783W4y3m6MoOaDJI45Ny0WRuPkH5efYppsOC4OnlTt7oAZqVMg92X62zgSADAzSRdifFeH6FLOqmLSX8E3SZOTQ61345AOuTyxEfOtmSGVRc5v-N-LJ13UN8aGolKmej5D4n5vS1P91-RF5aaDiVIAdhFPd-CzxmiNt0xkaFpaDiHLo2q9Lb_3vjeNxYxcBLy6PRLobBgsWTHVle6ZYze1L__U6HNGmSYF2BSjuIS9agTcWQ-7arrbrLHx5Ce1DvNaKZ3PP2RZb1B4HgCn6MkHWtiUY/Zu9lBg5T8x2TE_d24KFYB2E5YqXmaNe0/12), if the Hearst deal is voted down, then there’s no deal: “If the Hearst Merger is not approved by shareholders, we will continue to operate DallasNews as an independent organization.”",2,4,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkmaru/merger_arb_opportunity_daln/,new,Stock Analysis,1.0

Cut the crap, it's been 5 years and the bags have been carried. You here to act smug or make money?

This is not some fairy tale of a $69,420 stock price with pretty images and rocket emojis, no, this is your good old serious DD of why $GME is the safest, most asymmetric bet on the market right now. No short squeezes, no crime, no bells or whistles required — just a very low-risk multi-bagger based on facts and numbers.

## Core Thesis

You've already heard this section 5 years ago from a cat much smarter than me...

It's the Ryan Cohen’s two-phase turnaround plan, which he already executed once with Chewy.

**Phase 1. Stabilize the Business**

The first phase is to avoid bleeding or even bankrupcty. This phase is already done.

- Cut costs
- Close stores
- Streamline operations
- Grow cash
- Reach profitability

**These goals were already achieved at the cost of revenue decline and stock dilution**, both of which are seen as big red flags by institutions.
But these were predictable temporary downtrends, a clear part of the strategy.

**Phase 2. Growth & Digitalization**

Once the company has capital to expand with and no risk of bankruptcy, phase 2 begins.
This is what the institutions are overlooking, still valuing GME based on its history rather than the future — hence the asymmetric opportunity.

- Build new, profitable revenue streams
- Focus on high margin digitalized products
- Focus on repeating loyal customers

This phase has just started with Q1 '25 being the first operating profitable quarter, and Q2 '25 being the first operating profitable quarter with revenue growth.

Further revenue growth will be largely driven by the (growing) collectibles market, and we can already see a +63% collectibles growth in Q2 '25.

GameStop also has a partnership with the most reputable grading service in the US, PSA, which provides high trust and a large inventory.
This partnership enables GameStop to handle everything for the customer, allowing them to buy the card at GameStop, grade the card at GameStop, and sell the card at GameStop for a 90% margin.

Compare this to GameStop's biggest competitor, eBay, where the customer themselves have to do everything:

1. first they buy the card from a potentially scammy seller,
2. then ship it manually for grading,
3. only to then list and sell it manually on eBay for yet another potential scammer buyer.

All while eBay takes a larger cut of ~15%. Even a regard like me would realize it's better to go for GameStop.

For the future we also have confirmed Power Packs, a mystery box for collectible cards, being released as a high margin digital product.
It was just released into beta in Q3 so we don't even see the revenue yet, but knowing people a mystery box is going to be extremely profitable (and more importantly, high in revenue).

Also, there's probably more to come in the upcoming years or even months, but we'll ignore that for this thesis.
Let's only focus on the facts.


## Stock Floor

GME trades at ~$10B market cap, which is very near its cash value of ~$8B.

This heavily limits any potential downside on the investment:

- In the event of GME stock collapsing, the company could buyback its shares for extremely cheap (theoretically buy all of its stock and have money left over).
- In the event of a total market collapse, the company could acquire other companies for cheap.

With ~$450M annual interest income from the ~$8B cash, the business is profitable.
Additionally, both Q1 '25 and Q2 '25 saw positive operating income.

All of this sets a hard floor for the stock at around ~$20, if not higher.

The only real way below this point is for Ryan Cohen to actually _waste_ the billions in cash.  
After having already turned the company around from bleeding to profitable.  
And after erasing all the debt and generating the billions in the first place.  
And after having successfully executed this once with Chewy already.  
All while being invested in the company with his own skin; takes no salary, no stock compensation, just ~$1B worth of stock bought with his own money.  
But sure, he'll burn $10+ billion into nothing.


## The market mispricing

Subtracting the $8B cash from the market cap, we're left with the profitable operating business, loyal customer base, PSA partnership, and a well known brand all being valued at mere $2 billion.
All while leaving **zero** valuation allocated for the future growth potential, which is already visible and happening.

Some of this is explained with GME's P/E of ~50, give or take, which is very much in line with other companies like BestBuy or Chewy.
But these other companies don't have $9B in cash.

So if we only look at the *operating business* itself and calculate the adjusted operating P/E with:

    (Market Cap - Cash) / TTM Operating EPS

We get an adjusted P/E of 4. Yes, **four**.
Even if we subtract the zero interest convertible notes from the cash first, the adjusted P/E still lands at mere 11.
Compare this to peers with 20+ or even 40+ operating P/E, we're looking at 2x to 10x undervaluation.

This mispricing is most likely due to the history and ""meme stock"" status of GME. The big investors and analysts value their career stability and herd growth over stigmatized asymmetric bets:

- Nobody wants to invest into a *meme stock* and be wrong, they would look like a fool and lose a ton of clients or even their job.
- Meanwhile if they lose money in the big stocks like Tesla or NVIDIA, they can blame ""the market"" as they were all wrong together.

If you've seen The Big Short then you know that this kind of herd behavior is not at all abnormal for Wall Street.
Michael Burry's boss and clients yelled at him while the outsiders laughed at him, but we all know how the herd behavior ended for them.

Wait, did I forget to mention that institutions have already increased their position by 100% in just the last year alone?
That they now own ~45% of GME?
Yeah, maybe they're not *all* idiots.


## Stock Potential

The collectibles market in the US alone is ~$62B, estimated to rise to ~$83B by 2030.
Capturing mere 5% of this market would yield ~$4B in annual revenue.
This would be on top of their existing revenue of ~$5B.

Considering how collectibles have great margins, even a 10% operating margin is still a very reasonable estimation.
With these numbers we'd be looking at an annual **profit** of ~1B. That's an EPS of ~$3.00. That's a stock price of $50 - $100.
Again, with an adjusted operating P/E of 4 to 11.

And that is with mere 5% of just the US collectibles market.
With GameStop's brand, a loyal customer base, and PSA partnership, it's very much lowballing the numbers.
Add a bigger share like 10% or even 15%, add a small share of Canada/Europe/Australia as well, add another revenue source besides collectibles, upgrade the operating P/E to 20+...

We're genuinely looking at a target price of anywhere from $100 to $1000+, depending on how well they execute.

And if you *really* wanted to dream **big**, try giving GameStop an NVIDIA-like market dominance status with a 90+% market share of the collectibles market. Yeah, I'll choose not type that number out to avoid people dismissing this thesis as unrealistic.


## Opportunity cost

Let's finish with a very simple comparison with the S&P 500 over the next 3 years.

- **Upside potential:**
  - GME: 2x almost guaranteed, 5x very realistic, 40x theoretically possible.
  - S&P 500: ~33% average over 3 years, maybe ~50% theoretical high.
- **Downside potential:**
  - GME: -20% if operating business gets valued at zero and GME burns some cash on nothing. Chance of Ryan Cohen burning through all the cash is close to zero.
  - S&P 500: AI bubble bursting could crash the market. War or Trump could crash the market. 50% to 70% drop not out of the question. Chance is very real, even if low.

No investment is guaranteed, but GME is as close as we can get right now. It is once again, deep *fucking* value.",12,62,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkjcul/like_it_or_not_the_best_value_stock_out_there/,new,Stock Analysis,0.55
1nkii8i,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 15:54:25,I just bought 100 shares in DUOL,"A month ago I wrote a post in this subreddit entitled [I just bought 1000 shares in INTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/UjOsd1RTrg), with an entry price under $20.

I was called a few choice names, none of which I take personally.

My favorites were: 
""may God have mercy on your soul"" and ""OK grandma"" LOL

Now that the FED has finally lowered rates, I've been looking for an AI hyperscaler that can actually deliver.

#Financials

The first thing to catch my eye about DUOL was the quarterly revenue and gross profit curves. Can we all agree that they are a thing of beauty? 

This company now delivers operating margins of 13.5% and an ROE of 19.15%. Again, extremely impressive for a company that's only been profitable for 6 quarters. Their minimal debt shows disciplined execution.

But I don't think we're finished. I think DUOL has the AI-ready platform to scale to a ROE of 60%+ ...we could be talking about the next magnificent company here, a true compounder.

#The Courses

The next thing was to test the app. I had used it about 2 years previously, but now the improvements are enormous. 

They've obviously really thought about the course material, redoing it where necessary. I feel like they have some top PHDs designing the syllabus.

For example, it used to start with sentences like ""the dog drinks water""...

Now it starts with ""I want a coffee"" - literally the first thing you need to say in a new country. Sentence bridges like ""also"" and ""actually"" are introduced early as well, giving flow to sentences, building confidence.

The repetition is now broken up with AI voice calls, language games and podcasts, all hosted by their viral characters.

Recently they announced they would be expanding many more courses from A2 to B2 language proficiency level - even providing language proficiency certificates for employers.

I spoke to my 12 year old foreign nephew for the first time in English the other day. I asked him where he learned English? expecting him to say it was from school - NOPE, it was Duolingo - apparently it's simply fun...

#Unlimited Scalability

DUOL is right to focus on languages right now, but the courses they could add are endless. Here's just a few ideas:

- Sign language
- Personal finance (badly needed imho)
- Home/car maintenance
- Philosophy
- Business administration 
- Geography
- History 

They have already added Chess, Mathematics and Music - Where does it end?!

#AI Hyperscaler

Even without AI, this company is a gem, but with artificial intelligence it's a true beast. They can use AI for:

- Reducing human workload in writing repetitive course material (still human reviewed).
- Creating exciting upsells such as the ""Talk with Lily"" voice call feature.
- Initial drafting of illustrations (this feeds into their viral marketing).
- Directing customer service requests to the right human (my help ticket was responded to in under 2 hours!).

The idea of ChatGPT integrations competing with them is laughable. This isn't as easy to replicate at scale as it looks. They already have the user base momentum...

Actually, the fact most of us still use ChatGPT and Midjourney instead of Gemini, should tell us something about the significance of first-mover advantages in AI.

#Valuation

Now let’s address the high valuation. 

I'm not one of those morons that is going to tell you PE ratios don't matter - earnings absolutely do, and always will matter.

Normally as a value investor I wouldn't buy a company with such a high forward PE.

However, what I look at more is the TRAJECTORY of capital efficiency and operating margins - which in this case (given the clear AI runway) more than justifies the price.

This company is somewhat newly profitable. Some distortion of valuations are to be expected. Earnings in November are likely to continue showing improvement in capital efficiency.

1nkf9x3,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 13:52:27,Fannie Mae ($FNMA): Undervalued Housing Finance Giant Trading Below Book with Conservatorship Overhang (9/18/25),"Fannie Mae ($FNMA) currently trades around $13.84 (9/18/25) with book value estimates closer to $10–20 per share.

Despite generating billions annually through its mortgage securitization and guarantee business, common equity remains heavily discounted because of the ongoing government conservatorship and uncertainty over recapitalization.

With Deutsche Bank initiating coverage at Buy ($20 PT) and FHFA reportedly rehiring staff ahead of IPO preparation, the investment case is shifting.

Here’s the breakdown:
Valuation
- Book value range: $10–20+ depending on recapitalization assumptions.
- Current trading price: $13.84, which still embeds a large conservatorship discount.
- Fannie continues to retain earnings (since PSPA changes in 2019), building capital for eventual exit.

Catalysts
- Analyst coverage: Deutsche Bank’s Buy initiation ($20 PT) and B. Riley’s Neutral initiation ($10 PT) bring Wall Street attention.
- IPO chatter: Reports that FHFA is preparing for a partial IPO of Fannie/Freddie stock.
- Conservatorship exit: Any move toward release, recap, or restructuring could re-rate shares closer to book.

Risks
- Dilution: Treasury’s senior preferred conversion or a large equity raise could significantly dilute common shareholders.
- Policy dependence: Exit timing is political/regulatory, not market-driven.
- Interest rate cycle: Higher rates reduce originations and earnings power.

Conclusion
FNMA is not a traditional value play in the Graham & Dodd sense… it’s a policy-driven special situation. But with a wide gap between book value and trading price, and catalysts finally re-emerging (coverage, IPO prep), the asymmetric risk/reward profile makes it worth consideration for patient investors.",6,11,0,ValueInvesting,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkf9x3/fannie_mae_fnma_undervalued_housing_finance_giant/,new,Stock Analysis,0.88
1nkepvr,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 13:31:46,Starbucks (SBUX) - Is the company in a death spiral or is this a huge turnaround opportunity?,"**TLDR:**

Starbucks is facing its most profound crisis since 2008. The numbers are grim: global sales are falling, customer traffic is plummeting, and profit margins are collapsing.

In China, what was once their biggest growth engine has become a strategic disaster. They've been completely outmanoeuvred by a local, tech-savvy competitor (Luckin Coffee) and their market share has collapsed. They're now reportedly looking to sell a stake in the China business at a steep discount.

Back in the US, the company is locked in a bitter and expensive war with its own workforce, as hundreds of stores have unionised and the company faces charges of illegal union-busting.

The market is pinning all its hopes on the new CEO, Brian Niccol, the guy credited with turning around Chipotle. He has a comprehensive ""Back to Starbucks"" plan to fix the in-store experience, improve efficiency, and innovate the menu.

The problem? The stock is still trading at an insane valuation (P/E over 36), pricing in a perfect, flawless execution of this turnaround. This seems insane given the massive headwinds. Is the faith in one man justified, or is the market ignoring a business whose fundamentals are cracking?

I wrote a full, in-depth analysis breaking down the numbers, the China debacle, the union fight, and whether Niccol's plan has a realistic chance of success against such a risky backdrop.

Overview
Gambling.com Group ($GAMB, ~$300M market cap) runs an asset-light, high-margin model in the online gambling industry. It earns through:
	•	Affiliate business – referring users to betting sites, earning from new depositing customers (NDCs) and their ongoing activity.
	•	Data business – selling real-time betting data and analytics, now ~25% of revenue and growing rapidly, with strong subscription-like predictability.

Financials
Since its 2021 IPO, revenue grew from $42M to $127M in 2024 (CAGR ~45%). Gross margins remain ~90%+, with adjusted EBITDA rising to $48M and net income to $30M in 2024. Management guides 2025 revenue of $171–175M (+35% YoY) and $62–64M EBITDA (+28%). Historically, GAMB has beaten guidance.

Recent Sell-Off
Despite strong results, shares are down ~49% since Feb 2025 due to:
	1.	Google’s June algorithm update briefly hurting search rankings (since resolved).
	2.	Reported IFRS EPS loss tied to contingent earnout accounting for the Odds Holdings acquisition. This is non-cash and reflects the acquisition outperforming expectations.

Bullish Case
	•	Growing, sticky data revenue (quadrupled YoY, expected to reach 50/50 mix with affiliate).
	•	Expansion tailwinds from new U.S. state gambling legalization.
	•	Strong insider ownership (~40%) and doubled buyback program ($20M).

1nkcawm,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 12:02:17,Got into short term thinking and options.. need to reset.. get back to basics,"So I've been actively investing for 5 years now.. I really got my start during covid as I saw everything was down big and it was an opportunity.. for the first few years I was investing for the long term in most of the stocks I bought. I thought I would hold for at least a year+ .. perhaps forever if I had a lot of conviction.

Then around a year ago, I sold off some stocks for various reasons and had a big pile of cash - at that point, I decided to do a few short term swing trades.. on a few stocks/etfs I saw were see sawing back and forth in price somewhat reliably.. so I bought at the low point of the pattern and sold at the high point.. I did that a couple times and made a ton of money in a matter of weeks.. 

But I was being irresponsible with my position sizing.. I was putting 50%+ of my net worth into a single stock, thinking short term and would sell when I was up 5% - rinse and repeat.....   

However, you may see where this is going.. I saw a big blue chip stock was down 5% for the day.. so I dumped 60% of my entire net worth into it.. but then it continued to slump down.. and go sideways for a couple months.. and I grew antsy.. so I sold it all and took a 6 figure loss. A month or so after I sold it, it rocketed back up and far past where I had initially bought it. The thing is, I actually total belief that would eventually happen, but I got used to making money quickly - and got FOMO and bored waiting too long.

Then I dumped it all into another company that I felt had a solid brand and was trading at 5 year lows.. (for sure it will go back up soon!) .. and again.. it slumped down further over months..  quite a few months went by watching it go lower and lower - and I realized I was paying a big opportunity cost.. so I sold last week and booked a very large loss.

Also in this period of time I dipped my feet into options, mostly selling cash secured puts and covered calls.. options is something I completely avoided for the first few years of my investing journey as I didnt fully understand them and considered them risky.

Long story short - I realize this past year that I got sucked into the habit of short term thinking and essentially gambling and I paid a heavy price for it - as I made some money, but ended up losing more in the end. I also paid a massive opportunity cost - for if I'd just had a diversified portfolio, I would be up a lot this past year with a lot less stress. There were also good long term investments that I correctly recognized, but didnt take advantage of because I was chasing short term gains.

I'm considering removing options trading from my account and rebuilding a diverse portfolio.. with no position greater then 5-10% of my portfolio. Its like I need to retrain my brain to think long term.. and to stop being lured by the prospect of short term profits. 

Maybe I needed to actually learn this lesson the hard way though... maybe in the long run it will be a good thing.. that I actually tested these theories out and got burned.    

Has anyone been through a similar experience of getting lured into short term thinking and successfully recalibrated back to a long term/value investing viewpoint?

1nkbaoy,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 11:24:50,Wendy’s (WEN): An Overlooked Value Play,"TL;DR

Wendy’s trades at a steep discount to peers (EV/EBITDA ~9x vs McDonald’s/YUM ~18–19x). It pays a 5 to 6 percent dividend and has catalysts in AI and supply chain tech (Palantir partnership), a leadership transition and activist oversight. With a 95 percent franchised model that produces steady cash flows and low capital spending WEN offers asymmetric upside for value investors.

⸻

Why WEN Screens as Value

Multiple compression vs peers
WEN trades at about 8.5 to 11x EV/EBITDA while larger burger peers are near 18 to 19x and growth names like Shake Shack above 25x. Even a move back to 12 to 14x could mean significant equity upside.

Cash-light model with real yield
95 percent franchised with stable royalties and low capital needs. Dividend yield sits around 5 to 6 percent so investors get paid to wait.

Clear long-term growth plan at depressed expectations
Management’s algorithm calls for 3 to 4 percent net unit growth, 5 to 6 percent systemwide sales growth and 650 to 700 million dollars EBITDA by 2028. Hitting those targets would force a market rethink.

⸻

Tech and Operational Catalysts

Palantir partnership
Wendy’s supply chain co-op (QSCC) is rolling out Palantir Foundry to optimize purchasing, inventory and waste reduction. This directly improves margins.

AI drive-thru rollout
FreshAI voice ordering is planned to scale to 500 to 600 locations by the end of 2025. Faster throughput, better order accuracy and lower labor costs if successful.

Competitor pause creates open lane
One of the biggest burger chains paused its AI pilot which gives Wendy’s first-mover advantage if execution is solid.

⸻

Leadership and Activist Oversight

CEO transition
Kirk Tanner left in mid-2025. CFO Ken Cook is interim CEO while the board searches. A credible hire plus a refreshed plan can unlock a re-rating.

Trian Partners still at the table
Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund remains a major shareholder and has added shares. Trian has pushed for refranchising, real estate optimization and even take-private moves in the past.

⸻

Why Longevity Matters

Wendy’s was founded in 1969. In quick service, brand equity and menu consistency translate to pricing power and resilience. The Frosty, Baconator and spicy chicken franchise is sticky. That intangible is hard to replicate and underpriced when sentiment is low.

Potential Buyout or Strategic Moves

With a cash-generating, asset-light model and activist oversight a private equity takeout or refranchising and real estate deal is not far-fetched at today’s multiples. It is not a base case but does provide a backstop for downside.

⸻

Key Risks

U.S. traffic softness or promotional pressure on franchisee margins

CEO search taking too long or new leadership missteps

Execution risk on Palantir and AI initiatives

⸻

Bottom Line

At about 9x EV/EBITDA, a 5 to 6 percent dividend yield and credible tech plus leadership catalysts WEN offers a compelling heads I win tails I get paid setup for value investors. In a sector where everyone watches McDonald’s Wendy’s looks like a mispriced middleweight with upside potential.

People are starting to catch on to the fact that they are working on licensing out their 450 petabytes of video/audio to AI training models.

Some estimates on the low end are $450-900m (assuming the license everything as low end rates of what people pay for the data). Some estimates are over $4 billion (assuming high data valuations). The program for GoPro seems to be an opt-in, with 50% revenue split between GoPro and the owner of the data. 

GoPros market cap, even amid the run up is less than $400M. Assuming some sort of middle ground (fraction of the data is sold at a cost between high and low of the range) - this stock easily doubles or triples.

Shares in Intel soared nearly 30% in premarket trading Thursday after Nvidia announced it would invest $5 billion in the challenged chipmaker, giving the government’s turnaround plan a potential boost.

Nvidia said it’s buying $5 billion in Intel’s common stock at $23.28 a share and would jointly develop data center and personal computing products.


The investment pairs the world’s most valuable company, which has been a darling of the AI boom, with a chip maker that has fallen behind rivals. It further shores up Intel a month after the U.S. government said it was taking a 10% stake in an extraordinary private-sector intervention.

I started investing in about May sorta time and my portfolio has been up, down the down some more since. I’m happy where I am now though, and I’m looking to add another stock or two to my portfolio.

At some point when I first started, I found this basic checklist to screen stocks against before buying: 

 Dividends to Profit Payout Ratio
* 30%-60% Healthy Range
* 60%-85% Risky
* 85% + No Go

Steady Earnings Increase
* 5% - 20% each year

Low Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E)
* Above 3.0 High Risk
* Above 4.0 is absolute No Go

Good Free Cash Flow
* Steady or Upward trend in free cash flow

Good Return on Equity (RoE)
* 10%> No Go
* 12% Decent
* 15% + Strong

High Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)

I’ve used this as a base for some of my picks… and it just hasn’t worked. I feel like this is what I should be looking at, yet every time I’ve used it it’s failed me

Whereas when I first started, I went on the practice account in trading 212 and made a pie which is now up by 35%l… and I didn’t check a single company other than just looking at them and going “I like what they do”

 I’ve got a couple picks I wanna look into before actually putting money into them, so what do you look for and where do you look when screening a pick before investing?

I realise there’s more to it than just data and numbers, I’ve seen a lot of people say that they go way more off general “vibes”, looking at the market and the growth potential of the company rather than numbers, so I’m just interested to see what people look at before putting money into

Also, is my list just complete crap anyway?

Google and PayPal dropped news about a multi-year deal where PayPal becomes a key payment processor for Google Cloud, Google Play, etc. Stock only gained 3% after hours which seems modest for what sounds like a significant partnership.

PayPal gets integrated across Google's ecosystem and Google's AI gets incorporated into PayPal's security services. This seems more substantial than their usual announcements since it involves Google Cloud enterprise payments, not just consumer-facing features.

What's interesting for me is that PayPal has been pushing into advertising lately, and Google obviously dominates that space. Could this partnership open doors for shared advertising data? Both companies could benefit from combining Google's search/ad targeting with PayPal's transaction data. That would be a pretty powerful combination for advertisers.

Been considering picking up some PayPal shares. Does this partnership signal the bottom of the stock and maybe the catalyst PYPL needs to break out of its current trading range, or is that 3% aftermarket bump all we're likely to see?

The more I looked, the more it reinforced my view that this company is basically the most dangerous way to own Bitcoin. A few things stood out:

The premium is collapsing. MSTR used to trade at 2–3x the value of the Bitcoin it held. That gap has shrunk dramatically, and without that premium the whole “intelligent leverage” model stops working.

Dilution has gone into overdrive. They’ve raised tens of billions this year alone through share sales and preferred stock. The share count has nearly doubled in months.
The preferreds are Ponzi-like. Proceeds from new offerings are explicitly allowed to be used to pay dividends on the old ones. That’s not sustainable.

Michael Saylor’s “never sell Bitcoin” mantra ignores risk. It’s fine as a meme, but as a corporate policy it’s insane. If Bitcoin takes a typical 70–80% drawdown, the debt and dividend obligations wipe out the equity.
Even skeptics like Jim Chanos flagged this. He called it a “perpetual motion machine of dilution,” and watching the last few months play out, it really does look that way.

Here's the post if you want the full breakdown with a 15 minute podcast (charts, filings, stress-tests, etc.): https://open.substack.com/pub/tscsw/p/avoid-microstrategy-inc-the-bitcoin?r=203zi2&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true

It honestly feels less like a Bitcoin play and more like a house of cards that only stood up as long as people were willing to pay a crazy premium. Now that premium is eroding, is this the beginning of the end for MSTR?

Curious what others here think - am I being too harsh, or is this as structurally broken as it looks?

1nk3aw2,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 05:06:28,Planning to rebalance my portfolio at market open to gear it towards aggressive growth going into 2026. Would really appreciate any thoughts,"Hi all! This is my first time posting here. I am planning to rebalance my portfolio for reasonable growth without being reckless. I wanted to get some honest feedback.

A good percentage is built around big tech, semis, GLP-1s, and commodities. Also being aggressive across AI/datacenter, biotech, defense/space, crypto miners, uranium/metals, and consumer growth. Trying to keep things diversified but still give some names enough weight to move the needle.

Appreciate any thoughts! Always helpful to get other perspectives before I lock this in.

1nk33tp,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 04:53:24,$APLD DD AI Datacenters huge run from $3 --> $20 since April,"I think $APLD deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story.

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.

Not financial advice. Just my DD.
