Good afternoon, and welcome to r/dividends.  We are a community by and for dividend growth investors.  Our community was started all the way back in 2009 as a discussion forum for dividend investors.  Whether you are just starting out in your investing journey, or are months away from retirement, we hope you will find enjoyment in participating with this online community.  This post will go over absolutely everything you need to get started in the world of dividend investing.  Whether you are new or have been investing for years, it is well worth a read.

**Part 0: What are dividends exactly?**

From Investopedia:

>A dividend is the distribution of some of a company's earnings to a class of its shareholders, as determined by its board of directors.  Common shareholders of dividend-paying companies are typically eligible as long as they own the stock before the ex-dividend date.  Dividends may be paid out as cash or in the form of additional stock.[^([1])](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp)

Dividend investors are those who incorporate dividend payers into their portfolio.

**Part I: Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of dividend payers**

Dividend payers tend to be big, well-established companies that have an abundance of cash.  According to Steve Greiner, Vice President of Charles Schwab Equity Ratings^(®), *""They \[dividend payers\] often can't compete with the rapid appreciation of fledgling, fast-growing companies, so they use dividend payouts as an enticement.""*  Because of this, many newer investors often think of dividend payers as being the opposite of so-called ""growth stocks.""  In reality, it is usually dividend-paying securities that produce more growth over a long period of time.

Dividends, when reinvested, can significantly boost total returns over time, making dividend-paying stocks an attractive option for older and younger investors alike.  For example, if you invested $1,000 USD in a hypothetical investment that tracked the S&P 500 Index on January 1, 1990, but did not reinvest the dividends, your investment would have been worth $8,982 USD at the end of 2019.  If you **had** reinvested the dividends, you would have ended up with $16,971 - nearly doubling your returns.  The longer the timeframe, the more dramatic the disparity.  According to research conducted by the Hartford Funds, ""Dividends have played a significant role in the returns investors have received during the past 50 years.  Going back to 1970, a whopping 84% of the total return of the S&P 500 index can be attributed to reinvested dividends and the power of compounding.""[^([2])](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/market-perspectives/the-power-of-dividends.html)  Drawing from the decades of data available, intentionally excluding dividends from your portfolio could result in significantly handicapping your portfolio for decades.

With the S&P 500 yielding approximately 1.52% as of December 31, 2020, dividends paying securities can serve as an attractive alternative to Treasuries and other fixed income investments often pushed by professional retirement planners.

The downside to dividends is that they are not guaranteed.  This is important information to consider, as companies can and will stop paying dividends if necessary, or worse, if legally required.  Certain market conditions like the 2020 coronavirus pandemic can create an uncertain environment for dividend-focused companies.  In 2020, 68 of the roughly 380 dividend-paying companies in the S&P 500 suspended or reduced their payouts.[^([4])](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/2020-dividends-a-year-in-review-1029885286)

Fortunately, companies generally only cut their dividends when they are in distress, so favoring those with sound financial metrics can help mitigate the risk.

**Part II: Understanding how to pick dividend stocks**

If you create a post in the r/dividends subreddit asking for a list of good companies that pay dividends, your submission will be removed.  This is because this community believes firmly in the ""teach someone to fish"" mentality.  Instead of asking for a list of dividend payers, it is far more valuable instead to understand the fundamental ideas behind why specific individuals choose specific companies.  By knowing and understanding these principles, you can build your own portfolio that, if properly executed, could beat 90% of lay investors with relatively little effort.  While far from comprehensive, these six tips can help you identify dividend-paying stocks with strong financial health.

***#1.*** ***Do not chase high dividend yields:***  If a company has a high dividend yield, there is always a reason (most of the time not a good one) that a security is offering payouts that are well above average.  A good rule of thumb is that before you purchase a high-yield security (those with a yield of 5% or more), try to determine why it is so high.  It is important to note however, that the dividend yield is not a fixed amount, but in reality changes every second a stock is traded.  According to Investopedia:

>The dividend yield, expressed as a percentage, is a financial ratio (dividend/price) that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price.[^([3])](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendyield.asp)

If a high or rising yield is due to a shrinking share price, that is a bad sign and could indicate that a dividend cut is in a company's future.  However, if a rising dividend yield is due to rising profits, that indicates a more favorable scenario.  When net profits rise, dividends tend to follow suit.  Make sure you know exactly what is causing the increase before buying the stock.

***#2. Assess the payout ratio:*** This metric (calculated by dividing dividends per share over earnings per share) tells you how much of a company's earnings are going toward the dividend.  A ratio higher than 100% means the company is paying out more to its shareholders than it is earning.  In such cases, it may be able to cover its dividends from available cash, but that can only last for so long.

If a company whose stock you own is losing money but still paying a dividend for an extended period, it may be time to sell off and cut your losses.  US tax law allows you to write off up to $3,000 per year in capital losses in exchange for a tax credit.  Your circumstances may vary, so check your local tax authority.  The reason you may want to consider this option is because dividend payers in financial hard times may try to stave off a dividend cut by funding payouts with borrowed funds or cash reserves.  These actions will often drive away shareholders, forcing the share price down.  History also shows these actions rarely turn things around, and are usually just delaying the inevitable. (To those of you who know about REITs, keep reading, they will be addressed further down.

***#3. Check the balance sheet:***  High levels of debt represent a competing use of cash.  Under most global securities laws, a company must pay its creditors before it pays its dividends.  A fast-rising level of debt could indicate bankruptcy in the short or medium-term future.  Under US and EU bankruptcy law, corporations in the bankruptcy process are (depending on the circumstances) legally barred from paying dividends to shareholders.  Corporations with high debt levels may also look to the courts to assist in reorganizing debts without declaring bankruptcy.  Oftentimes, judges in these cases will force reductions or suspensions in dividend payments to prioritize the repayment of creditors.

***#4. Look for dividend growth:*** Generally speaking, you want to find companies that not only pay steady dividends, but also increase them at regular intervals (i.e. once per year over the past three, five, or even 10 years.  **Research has also shown that companies that grow their dividends tend to outperform their peers over time.^([2])**  Not only that, but a strong history of regular dividend growth also helps keep pace with inflation, which is particularly valuable to those who wish to seek financial independence and live off of their investments.

With that being said, just because a company did not increase their dividends in 2020 or 2021 does not make it necessarily worthy of exclusion from your portfolio.  Certain industries (like the top US banks) were legally prohibited by the federal government from raising their dividends during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Most companies have been hoarding cash to help weather the economic uncertainty, so it is not unreasonable to for them to keep dividends stagnant until the economy bounces back.  When it comes to companies impacted by the pandemic, look for other factors aside from dividend changes to determine whether or not the company is worth your investment.

***#5. Understand sector risk:***  Some sectors offer a more attractive combination of dividends and growth than others, but they also offer different risk characteristics that you should consider when researching dividend payers for your portfolio.  Stocks from the banking, consumer staples, and utilities sectors, for example, are known for steady dividends and lower volatility, but they also tend to offer less growth potential (though this varies from company to company).  Dividend paying tech companies, on the other hand, could offer attractive dividends along with the opportunity for larger price gains, but they also tend to be much more volatile.  If you are a long-term investor, you might be willing to accept tech's higher volatility in exchange for its growth and income prospects, but if you are nearing or in retirement, you might want to prioritize dividend-payers from less volatile industries.

***#6.  Consider a fund:***  If you are worried the potential for price declines eroding the value of your dividend stocks, consider instead a dividend-focused exchange traded fund (ETF) or mutual fund.  Such funds typically hold stocks that have a history of distributing dividends to their shareholders, and they provide a greater level of diversification than you can achieve by buying a handful of dividend paying stocks.  Funds are typically preferred by those who wish to take a more hands-off approach to their investments.  These will be your best option if you lack the time or inclination to conduct in-depth research of companies.

**Part III: Ideal age of the dividend investor.**

Oftentimes inexperienced investors will claim dividends are for those at or nearing retirement.  As was demonstrated earlier in this piece, nothing could be further from the truth. No matter what stage of your life or investing career, dividend-paying stocks can be a great way to supplement or even replace your income and improve your portfolio's growth potential.  Just be sure you research their overall financial health, not just their dividend rates, before investing.  There is no such thing as a right or wrong decision, as long as you achieve your desired outcome.

**Part IV: When not to reinvest**

Part I demonstrated how powerful reinvesting one's dividends can be, but there are certain circumstances where it can be more financially savvy to refrain from reinvesting your dividends.  Below are three situations in which you might want to deploy dividend payouts elsewhere.

* **You are in or near retirement:** When you are living off your savings, taking income from your dividends allows you to let more of your portfolio stay invested for growth.  If you are nearing retirement, on the other hand, you can use the payouts to build up your cash and short-term reserves as you prepare for the transition to life after work.  Some dividend investors have even built their portfolios to have their dividends cover 100% of their expenses.
* **Your portfolio is out of balance:**  Reinvesting the dividends of a well-performing investment back into that investment can throw your portfolio off balance over time.  In such cases, you might want to take the cash and reinvest it elsewhere.
* **The investment is underperforming:**  If you are worried about an investment's future prospects but are not quite ready to let it go, you may not want to reinvest the payouts back into that investment.  Instead, you might use the dividends to dip your toe into something prospective that could ultimately replace the underperforming investment.

**Part V: Understanding Taxes on your portfolio**

The question of taxes often comes up a lot in investing communities, and r/dividends is no exception.  However, we mods prohibit direct questions regarding taxes and other questions of legality because nobody here is a licensed tax professional in every single tax jurisdiction on Earth.  The question of taxes varies so wildly between regions that even making basic generalizations borders on pointless.  The only constant is that you will pay taxes at some point in your life on your investments.  Whether it is before you make your gains, after you make your gains, or somewhere in between, you will pay taxes.  The different types of accounts and options available to you varies based on your income, geography, employer, and dozens of other factors.  Some countries offer special accounts for those who serve in the military, law enforcement, or some other specialized profession(s).  Some trade unions help pay the taxes you may owe on certain investment types.  The variations on the tax question are so all over the place that I could break Reddit's character limit just covering the most general details.

Typically the best resource for understanding your local tax situation is the government agenc(ies) responsible for collecting your money.  As of 2021, most all have websites of various levels of usability.  They should often be your first stop for most questions.  When in doubt, always talk to a professional.

**Part VI: Special Snowflake companies (REITS, MLPs, royalty trusts, etc.)**

Some companies do not fit neatly into the category of an S-class corporation, and see themselves as special snowflakes worthy of a special tax status.  Understanding these entities is a critical prerequisite to holding them in your portfolio, as many may require additional tax paperwork.  In my personal experience, aside from REITS, most are not worth the time of the average investor.  Unless you already have a preexisting knowledge of how these companies work, I would not go out of your way to understand in-depth how they operate when there are so many options out there that could provide better returns.

The only exception to this rule is the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).  Unlike other special snowflake investments, REITs are relatively self explanatory.  They deal 100% in real estate.  Nothing else.  REITs are favored by dividend investors because of their special arrangement with the US government.  In exchange for not having to pay most federal corporate taxes, REITs are legally required to pass on at minimum 90% of their profits under GAAP to shareholders in the form of dividends, which are taxed as income by the US government.  The keyword here is GAAP.

Most places on Earth (aka the United States and almost nobody else) requires the usage of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (or GAAP standard of accounting).  GAAP is incredibly strict, intricate, complicated, and almost impossible to cheat.  100% of publicly traded companies in the US use GAAP, which makes comparing the finances of US stocks incredibly easy.  However, the tax structure of Real Estate Investment trusts often causes the math behind GAAP (or any other accounting system for that matter) to break down.  This can make REIT payout ratios look absolutely insane in relation to other companies, and can make most REITs look incredibly unprofitable.  To combat this, REITs have developed their own standards utilizing simplified math, called the funds from operations (FFO) metrics.  I originally had a more in-depth explanation of this concept (as well as information about BDCs, MLPs, and Royalty Trusts), but I had to cut it out of the final draft of this post because Reddit has a 40,000 character limit.  The best I can do right now is to point you in the direction of Investopedia, which has an [excellent article on the subject of FFOs, linked here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsfromoperation.asp).

The decision of whether or not to incorporate these types of investments into your portfolio is a personal one, and just like with any other type of investment, varies greatly based on your risk tolerance and portfolio goals.

**Part VII: Performing in-depth research on companies**

While anyone can read a balance sheet synopsis on Seeking Alpha and vaguely grasp its meaning, above understanding a concept is the ability to put one's knowledge into practice.  The reason I put this skill above actually picking companies is because stock picking can be done with a relatively low knowledge base, but actually digging deep into financial statements and balance sheets to discover companies on your own not on the traditional press circuit can serve as the true test of someone's research potential.

Oftentimes I come across even experienced investors unaware of just how many resources are available to them on this front.  While websites, apps, and YouTube channels exist all over the place, an often underutilized resource for investment knowledge is the companies themselves.  99% of publicly traded companies have a website dedicated to serving the needs of investors, often with email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses just begging to be contacted.  How much did Coca-Cola pay in dividends in 1926?  Google doesn't know (I checked), but I guarantee you somewhere in an Atlanta filing cabinet lies Coke's dividend history from back in that time.  It is obscure, seemingly random knowledge like that investor relations experts are paid to answer.

\[Side note: originally, there was going to be a far larger expanded section about this, but it was cut for the sake of conforming to Reddit's character limit.\]

**Part VIII: Diminishing returns and micromanagement**

By paying attention in school, you may have been informed regarding the law of diminishing returns.  When it comes to dividend investing (or any type of investing), the law of diminishing returns can play a big part of your portfolio management.  While you should always be on the lookout for investment opportunities, if day trading is the reason you wake up in the morning, dividend investing may not be right for you.  Strategies like buying right before the ex-div date and selling immediately afterwards rarely turn out in your favor, and even when they do are often not worth the trouble. Your gain will be a few cents at best, or worse you lose money.  In my experience as the lead moderator of this subreddit, monitoring comments, I can say with confidence that most people **will** lose money on this day-trading type strategy.  Most of the price action regarding a dividend took place days or weeks before the ex-dividend date, spread out over a period of time.  Companies often issue dividends on a clockwork schedule according to the [ISO Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date), so institutional investors are often able to predict when the dividend will be paid months or even years in advance, long before the boards of these companies officially announce their dividends.

A similar thing can be said for those attempting to buy stocks at the absolute lowest possible price.  I have seen individuals hold out for days waiting for a few extra cents.  If you have a six figure portfolio, you do not need to be trying to time a 12 cent price drop.  Your time will be better spent elsewhere.  Understanding the law of diminishing returns can sometimes singlehandedly turn an underperforming portfolio into an overperforming one.  By taking a hands off approach to most of your investments, you let the market work in the background of your life.  As the old saying goes, ""time in the market beats timing the market every day of the week.""

**Part IX: Debt and financing your investments**

Early in your investment journey, the idea of purchasing dividend stocks on debt sounds like a great idea.  Buy the stocks, use the dividends to pay off the loan, then keep the stocks and profit.  It sounds foolproof right up until it isn't.  What seems like free money is more akin to an advance on a sh\*\*\*y record deal.  If you decide to take out a $50,000 loan to buy dividend stocks, don't be surprised if acquiring a home or auto loan becomes significantly more difficult or downright impossible depending on your circumstances.  Banks and credit unions are often far more hesitant to lend out money to those with high amounts of preexisting debt.  When these loans are given however, they often come with interest rates higher than what you would have normally had to pay if you had not decided to buy a bunch of AT&T with a personal loan.  Any amount below $20,000 will hardly have a significant effect on your long-term portfolio (assuming you are still investing with earned income), and any amount above $20,000 could have serious ramifications on your ability to access credit in the event you truly need it.  If you fail to disclose this preexisting loan to any prospective lender, then congratulations, you have just committed fraud, which is something we do not condone here on r/dividends.

Your income and lifestyle should be sufficient to fund your investment needs.  While I understand the frustration that can come with being a student with 0 disposable income, being a student is actually the best possible reason **not** to have a five-figure unsecured debt load.  As someone with a degree in Management and a career in the field, I can tell you that many employers conduct background and credit checks on prospective employees (though credit checks on employees are illegal in certain states).  A $20,000 personal loan made by a 20 year old raises a lot of red flags, and while it could signal personal illness or medical debt, it could signal a gambling problem.  When you tell them you used the money to buy stocks, they will immediately assume gambling problem.  Good things come to those who wait.

**Part X: Brokerages and celebrity portfolios**

If you came to this post or subreddit looking for nothing but a brokerage recommendation, I recommend you look elsewhere.  While my wife and I personally use M1 Finance, and I do recommend it to friends and family, I have no idea who is reading this post.  I know only what information Reddit gives me as a moderator, so I will say that for the love of whatever you believe in do not choose a brokerage just because some internet personality, or some random person on Reddit told you about it.  Brokerages are not interchangeable, and they offer wildly different features and benefits. I like M1 because of the ability to form pies.  [This for example is my personal portfolio](https://m1.finance/qhxHMPtymDjd).  I enjoy what I enjoy about M1, and what it is able to offer me and my family.  Your situation is (likely) different.  This is also the reason we explicitly ban referral links on r/dividends.  The only recommendation I will issue is do not invest with Robinhood.  Other than that, go nuts.

**Part XI: Beyond dividends, and knowing when not to invest.**

Equally important to the skills of investing are the skills of knowing when not to invest.  If you have credit card debt, pay that off first, and make sure to pay 100% of your balance every month.  If you do not have an emergency fund, create one.  It should consist of roughly six months worth of expenses.  If you lack a financial plan or budget, create one.  My wife and I use [Mint.com](https://Mint.com) for our budget.  We sync it with our cards, and everything comes out perfectly.  I highly recommend it.

**Part XII: Seeking feedback**

Saving and investing can become an addiction, so it is important to know when to moderate it.  Having a third party provide additional input or opinions on your decisions can work wonders.  If you have a significant other or a best friend, I would recommend getting them into the investing mindset, if they are not already.  Having a trusted voice to bounce ideas off can lead to not only financial reward, but emotional and intellectual growth.

Since I took over this subreddit in August 2020, I have strived to create that environment here.  It is from this base framework that I am hoping future discussions in this community can branch from.  If you are just joining us, or have been with this community for years, I thank you for joining us on r/dividends.

Happy investing,

1mpzdzh,2025-08-14,2025-08-14 08:34:11,I hit over 8K dividends per year at 23y😃,"I have been investing in stocks for over 4 years and have learned from books by Peter Lynch, Charlie Munger, André Kostolany, and other investors. I have found that the dividend strategy suits me best.

I prefer to buy dividend kings and dividend aristocrats- companies that have always been strong in the market, have a solid presence, and deliver good financial results. I also diversify across sectors, but most of my investments are in consumer goods, finance, and healthcare, followed by industry, communications, and so on.

My portfolio currently has a dividend yield of just over 5%. On average, the companies in my portfolio increase their dividends by around 8% per year. Annual dividend growth is especially important to me, as it increases the compounding effect in my portfolio.

I reinvest almost all dividends, except in rare cases. By now, I am mostly accumulating, watching the market daily, and trying to pick up companies during drawdowns at an attractive dividend-to-price ratio (of course, only if they match my criteria).

I’m excited to share ideas with you.

n4u3fk,2021-05-04,2021-05-04 13:28:16,"My Niece and her ""Stonks""","So I thought everyone could use a chuckle...

Backstory:

Not too long ago my niece (turns 15 this month) that lives with me came bopping into my office and flopped down into the chair I keep behind my desk for her to sit and ramble while I work (she is a talker, lord can she talk, but for the most part you only need to half pay attn since all she wants is to feel heard, not actually be heard).

I happened to be researching some stocks trying to decide where to put my next few dollars, and she asked what I was doing. I told her, she wanted to know more, so we went down a rabbit hole of dividend and stocks explanations. She nodded, finished her rambling, and flitted off to be a teenage girl somewhere else for awhile.

I merrily go about my business for awhile, then she comes meandering back in holding her piggy bank. Turns out she had saved 45 dollars and was having trouble deciding what to do with it, and she REALLY liked the idea of her piggy bank getting PAID to be a piggy bank. I explain to her that I can start her her very own account, it will legally be hers, but she won't be able to touch it for years and years. She decides that's cool with her, as long as there is MORE money in the piggy bank when years and years happens.

So - flash forward to last week -

She, once again, comes bopping into my office, flops down in her chair, and loudly announces that she is here to review her STONKS. Apparently, she has heard this word, knows it applies to something to do with stocks, so now all her stocks are officially ""stonks"". Nothing I say or do will dissuade her.

So I pull up her stocks, which I've added a few dollars to here and there, and she sees her piggy bank is now worth over 55 dollars and is tickled pink. I then show her the payout for this month- a grand total of 57 cents - I'm worried she will be discouraged.

Instead, she gets to most dreamy girl in love in a movie look and says ""My stonks gave me free money... they really gave me free money... ""

She looked so happy I let her keep that thought.

Her birthday is this month, and she is wondering who is giving her cash and how much so she can get more stonks. I think she's gonna be alright.

Edit -  Umm... Wow. Thank you, each and every one of you.",1579,143,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/n4u3fk/my_niece_and_her_stonks/,all,Other,0.98

1irqkpz,2025-02-17,2025-02-17 13:16:59,Warren Buffett received a $740 million dividend payment from Coca-Cola (KO),"I recently came across a tweet highlighting Warren Buffett’s $740 million dividend income from Coca-Cola (KO). This sparked my curiosity: **What if Buffett had invested the same amount in the S&P 500 (SPY) instead?**

So, I created a comparison table based on his KO investment and a hypothetical SPY investment. Since I couldn’t find the exact purchase dates, I used quarter-end dates for my calculations.

The results are eye-opening:

* **Even after including dividends, SPY ($67.01B) outperformed KO ($38.17B) by approximately 75.6%.**
* Despite KO’s impressive dividend stream, SPY delivered far stronger total returns, highlighting the power of broad-market index investing over time.

I found it fascinating to see how Buffett’s legendary investment compares with the index, especially considering his recent sale of all SPY and VOO holdings.

I feel completely defeated.,"I've been building my dividend portfolio for years, aiming to reach financial independence one day. Every deposit was a small step toward a dream: a peaceful life, funded by passive income, no stress, no 9-to-5.

I chose what I thought were the best: SCHD, DGRO JEPQ, QQQI — solid US-based ETFs with great yield and growth potential. I had a plan, I was sticking to it. Then… comes Section 899.

For those who don't know: it's a proposed US tax law that could increase the withholding tax on dividends to 15% or even 30% for investors from countries deemed to have ""discriminatory"" tax systems toward the US. And guess what? My country (Poland) is very likely to be on that blacklist.

If the tax treaty is terminated (which is already being discussed), it means 30% goes to the US, and then Poland may charge another 19%. That’s nearly half the dividend gone. Just like that.

It feels like everything I’ve worked toward is falling apart. Switching to European dividend ETFs? Sure, but they have lower quality, less growth, and are not the same in terms of long-term compounding. It feels like being forced to start over — with worse tools.

Honestly, I’m gutted. Years of planning, DCA, building my ideal long-term strategy… and then politics slams the door in my face. I feel defeated. I had such a great plan and I was already so close :/ I wanted to hold SCHD and DGRO for decades and eventually pass them on to my kids.

I will do a follow up, answering most asked questions, because I couldn’t answer them all, nor edit the post to do so there at the time, so I’m making a new post now.

  
I will list most questions asked in random order.

  
**Can you share the portfolio? Sure, why not. Its in the** **attached images**

  
**How old are you and how long were you investing**

I’m almost 40 and i started at 20 but at the time I never took it seriously and just putting in like 20-50$ a month. I “seriously” started at around 23-24 when I was putting in approx, 300$ on average (that was a huge for me back then), and now averaging at around 2-2.5k per month. I’ve had a few good months in the meantime which allowed me to put more in the portfolio.

  
**How much you spend so you are able to invest that amount**

  
Not much at all. Never been a big spender. Approx 350€ a month myself (i share expenses with my significant other), with a total cost of 700€ a month (on average per month through the year). I live in a europe in a country where cost of living is not that high.

Other than that we have two old cars (20 and 15 years) - included in above expenses. We don’t wear fancy clothes or spend money on impressing others (this can cost you a fortune).

  
**Are you afraid of current market state (Tarrifs, Trump, potential recession)**

Yes and no. It’s hard to see portfolio plummeting, but i then remember myself I’m playing a long game. I’m not in a hurry, administration will change, markets will become green eventually. They did in the past, every single time. But again watching the portfolio now is not a pleasant feeling.

  
**What apps / tools are you using**

  
This one does not have unified answer. I started with simple excel (i’m still using it tho when i export the data from the app i use), I changed many sites in the past 20 years, then after apps and portfolio trackers became popular I’ve started using them too. 

I started with with an app that I don’t remember right now, then Stock Events app , then in mid 2023 migrated to the Inveester - https://inveester.com. And that’s because it gives everything I need and it has the cheapest sub model (my mindset is that any money that is not spent is re-invested). In the end I never settle and always looking for good alternatives.  

  
**Do you coach, .. suggest what to buy,.. etc**

No. And that’s because I’m not an expert in general sense. The money that is there mostly came from initial investment + observation.. and then repeating the cycle and then time made everything work together with compound interest. 

  
My suggestion is that you start as early as you can, but never is too late.

  
That's it. Hopefully this answers most of your questions.",992,128,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxqcdg,all,Personal Goal,0.98

1nhzad1,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 17:50:54,"First $100k, 5 years in","36yom investing seriously for 5 years in a Roth IRA and Roth 457b

I’ve had my 457b for 10 years, but I was only throwing nickels and dimes at it. I had $7,000 in it 5 years ago when I began taking my retirement seriously. 

My Roth IRA is roughly: 25% QQQ, 25% VTI, 25% VIG, 22% SCHD, less than 2% MSFT & DGRO

My Roth 457b is roughly: 53% SV-COM (state street S&P 500), 22% V0128A (MFS International blend), 8% DFFVX, 6% LMOIX, 4% ANCFX, 3% VERIX, 1% BAGSX, BGRFX, NVLIX, and PORT (empower guaranteed portfolio)

I’ve self invested my Roth IRA, and my Roth 456b is robo invested through empower. The 457b is purely growth, they don’t offer any dividend plays. My IRA I’m balancing both growth (QQQ) and dividends (the rest). I had been running a 25/25/25/25 with QQQ, VTI, VIG, and SCHD for awhile. I bought MSFT with Schwab slices to make sure I was as close to 100% invested as I could be (you can’t buy dividends on stock slices). Lately I’ve been slightly less pleased with how SCHD has been performing and have begun adding DGRO. 

In the last 5 years I’ve also been able to buy a home, travel, eat out, etc. I’ve done all of this while pulling in roughly $100k a year. 

My plan is to retire at 60 and turn my IRA into a full dividend account and never touch the nest egg as I draw down my 457b and collect my pension. My pension is small, but I don’t have to fund it at all. It should be roughly mid $30k a year based on what I make now. 

I see a ton of people posting on here with million dollar accounts and for regular people I think it’s hard to relate. I wanted to show even working class people who are consistent can live good, and make investment gains. They say your first $100k takes the longest, here’s hoping to get another $100k in less than 5.

My yield is pretty low as I’m prioritizing growth — 401k streams directly into the S&P, for example — but lately I’ve been adding some more dividend players because it’s been fun seeing the annual div amount grow. I’ve also been accumulating SCHD for the last 3 years or so. Most of my purchases are ETFs or large/reputable companies that I expect to be around in 10+ years.

For added context/info, I’m 28. I know dividend stocks aren’t totally advisable for someone my age, but increasing my overall earnings keeps me motivated and keeps me investing more consistently; it almost gamifies investing. The way I see it, nothing we do is perfectly optimized. Sure, we could all just put our money into VOO and not ever think about it. We could also eat nothing but steak and salads and rice every day. But we’re all imperfect and personally I enjoy a nice piece of cake and for me dividend stocks/ETFs are just that. Even if it’s not absolutely optimal, these purchases make investing fun and I hope to own enough via accumulation of shares/DRIP to have a steady income stream one day that could cover most/all of my expenses.

I also like the idea of being rewarded for owning a stock, realizing gains without needing to sell shares. Most (maybe 70%) of my dividend stocks/ETFs are in my Roth IRA so my tax drag is low.

Just wanted to share my portfolio/milestone hit. I’m not trying to actively “beat the market”, but I want to enjoy investing and love to see my dividend yield grow every month. I’ll be adding a few more dividend stocks over the remainder of the year — I just bought two shares of PG, one share of ABBV, and two shares of KO this morning, for example. $1,000/month next!

I got to the point where I just wanted to go myself, but the solo cost seemed out of reach. I did the math and, almost as an afterthought, realized that the entire cost is about two months of dividends/distributions. I’ve been so disciplined about reinvesting my distributions every month that it became an essential “expense” like my condo fee or power bill. It never crossed my mind to simply collect them for a few weeks and use them for something else.

I know that sounds silly and that a lot of people pay other expenses with dividends, but for me this is when it really hit me. For the first time I felt a hint of that financial independence and security that I’ve been working toward. I booked my trip and all it is costing me is the few shares that I otherwise would have bought, and I’m okay with that. This is why I invest. This is why dividends add value to my life.

nzas2f,2021-06-13,2021-06-13 21:00:41,"Pro Tip: Live under your means, but remember to enjoy your youth.","Hey there everyone.

One thing I see often on this subreddit is about how extremely young people start to invest into a dividend portfolio, and continue to save every dollar they can. Just the other day I saw a 16 year old on this sub starting his portfolio.

The best thing I always tell all my friends about finances, is the sooner you start, the better off you will be due to compounded interest. If you are especially more aggressive your first couple of years, it will even reap the benefits more. 

However, I also tell them to enjoy their youth, and don't nickel & dime everything you do. Your most precious time of your life is going to be your youth (especially college and 20s to Mid 30s) 

Seriously, enjoy your youth. Statistically speaking, the average person that is a super aggressive saver is not going to FIRE or Live off dividends until their 40s. Your youth is gone.

I believe the best approach to it is like this:

**Post College -** Get new job, pay down debt from school (if the loan has high % low percentage not really), aggressively save into 401k/dividend portfolio until mid-20s

**Mid 20s-Early 30s -** Focus on your career, save, but not too aggressively. Focus on house/property and checking out different things in life.

**Mid 30s to 40s -** Try saving more to live off the dividends before 50. 

TLDR: Enjoy your life. Trying to live off your dividend portfolio is great, but don't forget you only get one shot at life. Enjoy it.",788,104,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/nzas2f/pro_tip_live_under_your_means_but_remember_to/,all,Opinion,0.97

I have been 100% growth stocks and ignored dividends up until about 2 weeks ago when I used this pullback to trade out of tech growth individual stock into JEPQ and SPYI ETF’s.  I’m currently at 55% /45 % Funds to equities and have larger equity holdings in AVGO, JPM, HD, PLTR, CRWD, META and AMZN.

So recently I achieved to make my portfolio to generate $5,500/month dividend income. I took screenshots from my app ""DivTrakcer"" because thats what I have been doing ever since I started sharing my dividend journey. Someone stated mine was fake and anyone could fake the numbers in app. While I understand that, who actually has time to fake the account just to post on reddit...? And why would anyone do that....  

But at any rate, my accounts are managed in M1 and just wanted to share my dividend taxable account for transparency. I have my rolled-over 403b account which is worth 125k at the time of writing. 

If you are hungry, then work your ass off and put that money to work for you. I had 3 jobs for the longest time working 7 days for many years in my 20s and most of 30s. While I only started stock investments about 3 years ago as I was heavy in real estate investments in the past, it took me years to save chunk of money to use as seed money. Wish you all the best in your investment journey. Sacrifice early on to have a better life in the future. You dont want to live the opposite life where you are financially struggling in your 40, 50, 60...

nwxs6i,2021-06-10,2021-06-10 16:35:14,"Learning is Cool ($350k invested / $13,470yr Income)","I shared some of my story in a comment a few weeks ago. I thought it would be good to expound a little bit to encourage those of you that are just getting started. First of all, I encourage all of you to enjoy the learning process. The thing I love most about dividend growth investing, besides the monthly income, is the education. This sub reddit has furthered my education in the last couple months, which is so great!

Before I continue I do want to point out that at some point in time I threw probably most of my savings at Dividend Growth investing and I also had weird circumstances the last couple years that allowed me to invest more than I normally would be able to. I do feel like I'm a little late to this game, but better late than never. ***Some people may be discouraged and think that they may not make enough income for this sort of investing. However, habits and mindset are important and you want to have these in place if you have opportunities to make more income in the future. If you are ever going to get ahead, you need to start somewhere. And you need to start sooner, not later. Also it's been my experience that investing and wanting to see your yearly income grow can drive you to try to make more income. Lastly, compounding income does amazing things.***

Prior to learning about dividend investing, I hadn't invested much and my strategy was terrible. Typically I would purchase a stock like Apple at a somewhat high price, hold for a few months while I grew inpatient only to sell at a much lower price. Because of this, I convinced myself that the only people that made money in the stock market were day traders.

Summer of 2019, one day on YouTube I ran across a video by Andre Jikh. I hadn't previously watched any of his videos but for some reason the title of this one video stuck out to me and I watched it. He talked about how he was investing in stocks that paid dividends in his Robinhood account. After watching the video, the lightbulb in my brain turned on. I loved the idea of monthly income. It made sense to me. I loved the idea that I could retire and live off of the dividends instead of selling off the principle of my retirement to pay for my living. And I loved the idea that I could see income from it right away. I could see this thing grow and compound through income that I was generating every month. Amazing. I started buying dividend stocks in my Robinhood account.

In one of Andre Jikh's videos he talked about Simply Safe Dividends, which is the platform I use to track my stocks. They provide reports on any changes with the holdings that I have along with a pretty helpful rating system. Even though it was expensive at the time, $400, I felt like just as soon as I could, this subscription would not only help keep me out of trouble, but would provide me with a lot of education and also encourage me to keep investing. It's cool seeing the yearly income number grow every week.

Eventually I ran across another YouTube Channel called the Joseph Carlson Show. I love how Joseph thinks. I quickly saw the advantages of using the M1 Finance platform that he talked about with their pie system. So I sold my stocks in Robinhood and repurchased them in M1 (It somehow worked out and I didn't know how to move them at the time).

I continued to learn as much as I could. I bought a lot of stocks based on the resources I had listening to Joseph Carlson, Dividend Data and seeing what Simply Safe had to say about things. I stopped listening to Andre Jikh very much because he seemed to veer off more into growth stocks and then today it seems like all he talks about is Crypto, not dividend stocks at all. Things change, people change and certainly this has been a weird year. 🙂

In 2020, March through May was obviously a hard set of months. My income went way down but every penny I could get a hold of I used to buy the dip. Summer of 2020 when my income started going back up, I used some of that money to buy growth stocks. It was a distraction from my overall strategy of dividend stocks, but it certainly helped me grow my money quickly. This last year has been unlike any other so I don't really recommend buying growth / tech stocks the same way I did last year. I've since sold those things to put back into my dividend portfolio. December of 2020 I bought some Bitcoin and then I sold it several months later to add to my dividend portfolio as well. Not sure that's something I would recommend either.

One thing I did in 2020 that I'm really glad for now, is I invested a good bit into the energy sector. Those stocks have grown pretty considerably since I was able to purchase them at good prices last year.

Today I'm sitting at $350,000 in stock value in my M1 account. 69 holdings. $13,470 per year in income. Beta of 0.83. Dividend Yield of 3.84%. Today I continue to learn by reading this sub. This sub has made me aware of more educational resources on YouTube and has also opened my mind to the idea of different kinds of dividend paying ETF's that I may explore soon. It's rad having a community where you can see each other's stories and be encouraged by them to keep going.

In closing, here are some things that I've learned and some things that I want to encourage you guys with:

* Enjoy the learning
* Create a playlist and listen to good dividend investors on YouTube whenever you get a chance
* Invest regularly
* Set small goals for yourself to increase your yearly dividend income

Hope this is encouraging. I have no idea. Sorry that it's kind of also long winded. 🙂👍

Thanks mates. Happy dividend growth investing.

**EDIT 2:** Because so many stocks seem very inflated these last many months, I put a high threshold on Auto-Invest so that as dividend income comes in, I can make my own purchases on stocks that may be a better deal right now. I've been putting a lot more focus on my Consumer Staples pie (HRL, KMB, KR, MO, WBA, TSN...). Buying up stocks of boring companies where people rely on their products.

**EDIT 3:** What makes M1 Finance kind of unique is their pie and reinvestment system. You setup your sector pie and stocks within each slice, and then as you get dividends, those dividends are automatically reinvested into the pie wherever your are underweighted. Traditional brokerages seem like they do more of a drip system, if you set it up, which will have your dividends purchase more of the stocks that the dividends came from. I suppose there are pros and cons. You can always turn off auto-invest in M1 Finance and just invest the dividends into whatever stocks you like.

Another reason that I like M1 Finance is the ability with their Plus account to get 1% interest on any monies I have holding in my Spend account. And then if I needed to borrow money against my portfolio, I could do that at 2% interest.

I think that M1 Finance is geared toward the long term dividend growth investor but I wouldn't call it a must have. For stocks that I've purchased purely for growth and not dividends, I use either TD Ameritrade or Fidelity. With M1 you only get 2 trade windows per day (with Plus), which means you can't really buy or sell quickly if there's an opportunity. But I like it. And the M1 app is really great.

**EDIT 4:** Thank you everyone for all the upvotes and rewards! Too kind.

**EDIT 5:** The Title may be misleading to say ""$350k invested"". In the last 1.5 years at my current brokerage, I've experienced about $78k in gains. Around $65k in market gain and about $13k in dividends earned. So more accurately I have somewhere around $272k invested. It's obviously a lot of market gain and that's just because of the craziness that we've experienced in the last year. The reality of my first 6 months doing dividend investing was that I didn't really see a ton of gains. But when I started seeing dividends coming in, that's what got me excited. The value of stocks go up and down. But those dividends are something special.

**EDIT 6:** Per request I'm posting my holdings. Disclaimer: I am still a noob. However, I think you can see that most of these stocks are pretty boring, relatively safe dividend payers. Here's what I have by order of greatest to lowest percentage in my portfolio: AVB, O, XOM, EPD, CVX, MMP, PBA, MO, BEN, MAIN, VZ, GPC, HD, MCD, KMB, IBM, MRK, ABBV, UGI, OGE, PBCT, DIS, WBA, SNA, ORCL, STOR, HRL, CASS, MSM, JNJ, PFE, CTBI, NFG, GD, KR, ED, AEP, LHX, TXN, MDT, DUK, GILD, CSCO, VTRS, CAH, PM, AOS, PSA, LMT, AAPL, PEP, TSN, FRT, AVA, DLR, ADM, HSY, WPC, MMM, GIS, EBF, SJM, CL, PG, NAT, HCSG, SWM, UNP, WM.

Been dividend investing for 3 years across different accounts and finally hit my monthly milestone. Total portfolio around $300k, average yield about 4.45%.

Current strategy:

* SCHD + JEPI (\~40%)
* O for monthly payments (\~20%)
* AAPL + MSFT (\~20%)
* Various dividend ETFs in 401k (\~20%)

Love seeing the monthly projections increase. Never thought I'd actually hit $1k monthly when I started.

1ny9jmn,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 20:00:27,PizzaTrader Stock of the Month: October 2025,"Those of you who have followed along with my posts have hopefully learned that market pessimism towards high quality companies presents opportunity. At this moment, restaurants and companies supporting the restaurant industry are slightly beaten down. This will allow us to grab future cash flows at a discount and improve our chances for price gains over the long term.

This month’s featured stock is Domino’s Pizza (DPZ).
Disclosure: I own a position and presently intend to hold into the future. 
Disclaimer: For educational purposes only, not investment advice.

Business Model:
DPZ earns income from royalties and franchise fees from over 20,000 retail pizza stores, as well as the sale of ingredients and supplies to those franchisees.

Dividend Highlights:
- The current dividend is $6.96 annually, translating to a yield of 1.63% at the current stock price of $426.71.

- DPZ has increased its dividend for 11 consecutive years.

- The average dividend yield over the past 10 years has been 1.06%. Therefore, today’s investor will purchase a cash flow stream 59% more valuable than the long-term average.

- I typically aim for a 15% Chowder Ratio with new stock purchases. DPZ has an excellent Chowder Ratio of 19.04%!

Investment Performance:
- An investor who bought $10,000 worth of DPZ 10 years ago and reinvested all dividends would have experienced total returns of 344.56% with a current value of $44,456. This performance defeated broad market indexes (like the S&P 500), although this performance may not continue into the future.

- The 2015 investor initially bought the stock at a yield of 1.14%, expecting $1.24 per share in their first year of ownership. Today, that same investor is set to earn $6.96 per share, resulting in a yield on cost of 6.42%. As with all of my Stock of the Month selections, patience has paid off for long-term investors!

Future Outlook:
- While the future is always uncertain, investing in Domino’s comes with several potential rewards, including annual dividend increases, price improvements, and high likelihood for ongoing dividends. 

- The company’s annual dividend is typically announced early each year.  The dividend increase in 2025 was an excellent 15.2% and has been double digits over each of the last 10 years!

- The company’s dividend payout ratio is 40%, a healthy ratio which would allow dividends to double over the next 5 years (14% CAGR) without requiring any earnings growth.

- There is also an opportunity for price improvement. Assuming a steady dividend growth rate of 15% until 2030, and a return to the average dividend yield of 1.06%, today’s investor might have stock worth $1,301.89 (205% price return) and earn a yield on cost of 3.23%.
 
Conclusion:
-  For the above reasons, DPZ is my choice for Stock of the Month and is well-positioned to continue its long-term creation of shareholder wealth. 

Portfolio Performance:
The Stock of the Month portfolio (nine months so far), is up 10.8% in price and has earned 1.26% in dividends for a total return (dividends not reinvested) of 12.1%. This is favorable to SCHD’s 4.02% total return over the same time period.

If you automatically reinvest dividends, what happens if the dividends are not enough to cover the purchase of a single share? Do they accrue over time until they reach the sum that can cover the purchase of a holding? 

For example, each share of VOO costs $615.17

Let's suppose I buy 5 of them and set to automatically reinvest the dividends. The dividends that 5 shares of VOO pay are not sufficient to buy another single share of VOO. So, what happens in that case? In my opinion, the most logical explanation is that the dividends accrue until they reach $615.17 and that is when the automatic purchase is made.

1nxvxu3,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 10:47:36,A tech stock with 2% yield just beat every utility in our dividend rankings.,"Our systematic dividend framework ranked QUALCOMM #1 in October. Not a utility. Not a REIT. A semiconductor company yielding 2.09%.

If that surprises you, your screening process might be filtering out quality before you ever evaluate it.

**What happened:**  
We score every S&P 500 dividend payer monthly using identical criteria: sustainability (30%), growth (25%), yield quality (25%), and consistency (20%). See further details in this post:   
  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1mpx2n6/why\_we\_stopped\_chasing\_high\_yields\_and\_built\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1mpx2n6/why_we_stopped_chasing_high_yields_and_built_this/)  


QUALCOMM scored 7.9/10 with near-perfect sustainability metrics:

* 32% payout ratio (paying less than 1/3 of earnings)
* \>9 consecutive years of 7% dividend growth
* Perfect free cash flow coverage
* A balance sheet that can weather severe downturns

**Why this matters:**  
Most dividend investors start by filtering sectors: Utilities + REITs + Consumer Staples only. Then sort by yield, highest first.

That approach eliminates QUALCOMM before you ever look at the fundamentals. Wrong sector. Low yield. Never considered.

We picked it in August at $150.58. By October, it hit $166.36 (+10.5% dividend-adjusted). Three months is obviously too short to validate any methodology, but it demonstrates the concept: we identified sustainable quality before price reflected it, not by predicting movement but by evaluating fundamentals systematically.

**The challenge to conventional wisdom:**  
Traditional dividend screening assumes quality lives in specific sectors. But business models evolved. Technology companies with licensing revenue now generate more stable cash than many cyclical industrials or retailers. A 2% yield backed by a 32% payout ratio will compound for decades. A 6% yield at 80% payout has nowhere to go but down.

We weight sustainability heaviest (30% of score) for one reason: dividend cuts destroy you twice. Capital loss + income loss. Finding companies that won't cut matters more than finding companies yielding 6% today.

Is anyone else here evaluating dividends without sector filters? Or do you think we're crazy for ranking a semiconductor over utilities and REITs?

This ARR is based on consensus revenue estimates and regression analysis of median-reverting metrics like EV/Revenue and Price-to-Book ratios, essentially projecting where the stock should trade as valuations normalize.

As far as quality:

**Gross Margins at 83.9%** is outstanding. For context, pharma companies typically run 60-80% gross margins, so NVO is at the upper end. The chart shows remarkable stability around 80-85% over the past decade, indicating strong pricing power and efficient manufacturing.

**Operating Margins of 45.8%** demonstrates excellent operational efficiency. While pharma can range from 20-50%, NVO's consistent 40%+ shows they're converting those high gross margins into actual operating profit effectively.

**Interest Coverage at 16.9x** means the company earns nearly 17 times what it needs to service debt. Anything above 5x is considered safe; this is fortress-level financial stability.

The one yellow flag is the **Cash Conversion at 55.8%**, which is below the ideal 80-100% range, suggesting some gap between reported earnings and actual cash generation. Worth monitoring.

With the GLP-1 market exploding and NVO dominating the space, do you all view this valuation gap as a genuine opportunity or are there demand sustainability concerns I'm missing?",43,22,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nxs9jj,new,Due Diligence,0.88
1nxrqqp,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 07:42:11,Dividend Strategy - Ireland,"I (32m) really like the idea of dividend investing - I'm really drawn to the idea of semi-stable monthly/quarterly income generated from the money I've earned through work. 

That being said, I'm in the younger side and the prevailing wisdom is growth over dividend until much later in life.

So at the start of this year, after some research, I decided to invest monthly in three etfs - iShares core world IWDA (growth), Vanguard S&P 500 VUSA (growth) and JPM global premium equity JEPG (dividend). With some heavy investing and some restrictions on cost/qualiry of living (not monk level, minor stuff)

My ultimate goal, like many, is to get to a point where my baseline costs of living is covered if/when something happens to my full time job. 

I had a 33.33% DCA split for the first few months but then I got a bit impatient, sold my positions in IWDA and VUSA and concentrated on getting JEPG to a significant point. 

Now, we're coming toward the end of the year. My JEPG position is ~4000 shares (~€92k) and the dividend has been significantly lower than i had modeled (~.15 per share monthly compared to ~.2 modelled) and due to the weak dollar I'm down overall. 

I'm kind of ok with this position, it earns me gross ~€500 euro a month, maybe more, maybe less, and will build. But I expected to be closer to net €500 a month by the end of the year. 

I suppose the question is, is this the best thing to do with your investing capital? Are there better ways to use my money to generate a secondary income? I also really hate the high tax on this in Ireland so any suggestions on how to minimise the tax drag would be amazing. 

Any general critiques of this approach or suggestions on better approaches specific to Irish investors would be great!

There is the option of the 4% withdrawal rate per year of investments at retirement with the goal of not outliving your investments. I believe this method relies on investment in growth funds at retirement. 

Would there be dividend investments that could potentially also satisfy this option?  Obviously would be less growth and or less dividend payouts. Just throwing this out to people that are smarter than me (which is most)

**Dividend Coverage Ratio:** Like 50%. Unlike some companies (glares at $UPS), they didn't raise their dividend during the ephemeral demand boom during COVID. Based capital management.

**Dividend growth prospects:** Estimating an average of 8% dividend growth per year, for the next 12 years. That will take it from 5.12% current yield, to 12.92% in 2037. If I'm within 4% of that goal, I'll be happy.

But this eerily resembles the madness around covid time when QYLD suddenly shot out into the daylight. Every other post either demonized it or praised it as if this was the messiah that would help dividend lovers retire. Every tom dick and harry was writing about it, on blogs/you tube/reddit. 

Have a look at the chart below. Although it was well know that QYLD suffered from NAV erosion, it actually did well for 8 years or so by recovering to its inception price of 25 bucks - twice. In other words, it did rise when markets kept rising. Not bad if something delivers 10% and has a modest NAV erosion. BUT then some thing happened right around Feb 2020  - It just started nose diving and has not been able to rise again even though markets have far surpassed the ATH of Feb 2020.

I don't know what exactly changed in 2020. But i worry that similar fate may be in store for cc etfs that are being touted today by rainy season frogs. Although the initial performance of these is quite good but so was QYLD for  god damn 8 years.

1nwnzek,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 23:02:20,Mortgage payoff vs dividend investing,"TL;DR - Pay off mortgage = true wealth long term. Not pay off mortgage but invest = more $ up front if we have a prolonged bull market and asset prices keep going up.

\---------  
Hi All. I get see a lot of posts, and I get asked often ""is it better to pay off my house with a lump sum, then invest that mortgage amount each month, or to invest in dividends and use those payments to help pay off the house"".

I ran the financials on a few scenarios and the general consensus is this:

In terms of raw, wealth creation paying off the mortgage and investing the mortgage amount each month creates a higher number. Ie you have more positive NET WORTH and you have more true ""money/wealth"". However, the net-present-value of your networth takes a hit. This is because money now is worth much more than money in the future.

**Take away;  if you want future value, and strong real wealth, pay off your mortgage and invest.**

In terms of present value of your money, and your view of the future in terms of real estate prices, stock market prices, inflation etc, then NOT paying off your mortgage and investing the money provides more value right here right now, and LESS real wealth over time. Over the same period of time you have a lower net worth and are much more sensitive to changes in the market/prices/rates/etc.

**Take away: if you believe in ""up only"" for the duration of your mortgage then do not pay off your mortgage but invest the money.**

The ""right"" decision is one has to make for themselves and there are many ethereal factors, such as risk appetite, known-unknowns, unknown-unknowns, ""what happens if I lose my job"", sickness, un-forseen life changes etc. 

The route I advise and the route I personally took, is to pay off the debt, and I use that monthly amount to invest into my dividend portfolio. I am pretty risk averse, and my plan is to leave everything to my children for generational wealth.

1nwm5ni,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 21:32:31,Investment Advice,"Sorry for the length but Pretty much the title.
Recently my grandfather passed. It’s been really hard. My grandma just mailed me a check from money that was left from the fund he was using to go on trips with her the past decade. It’s several thousand. I’m in my mid 20s and have never been able to save for shit. I’ve never possessed more than several hundred maybe a thousand at any moment except for the stimulus check. That’s the most I’ve ever had. And I splurged it on dumb shit since it hit my bank account while I was on a cross country road trip vacation with a friend since I went on the trip only having like $500 and it was pretty rough haha. 

Anyways, if left to my own devices it’ll slowly widdle away over the next few months between bills and small shit that adds up. Note, I never make big purchases even when it saves money long term due to feeling anxiety about spendigg by money. So, for example, I’ll end up spending $5 here and $10 there until it ends up being several hundred over the course of a month. I’ve been needing to get stuff for the past year. I’ve wanted to get a new microphone and headphones and audio interface for my studio (I make music on the side, but it’s not a necessity which is why I haven’t been able to save for it) and I haven’t been able to save up enough to take a trip to see my friends since I moved almost 4 years ago, and it’s been lonely not having any friends here. I wasn’t able to see them last year. So I want to do that this month when everyone gets together for the Halloween party.
 
So to put it frankly I want to learn how to invest my money in a way that will earn money quickly. I don’t want to use any of it. So I don’t mind putting like $2k in some long term fund. But I know with stocks you put in $500 and after 5 years you have $550, and even tho it is assured profit I don’t want to waste it sitting around for years just to make 5% interest. I want to invest it wisely in ways that can make money fast. Double in in a few months kinda fast. Turn $5000 into $6000 within a month so I can see my friends speed. 

I know there’s no real get rich quick scheme, and Ik there’s no easy money methods. But I do know there are ways to make money fast IF you already have a sizeable chunk of money to work with. Which I previously didn’t have. It’s hard to start investing when $10 invests to $15 over a few days or whatever. But if you do the same with $1000 that’s $1500. $5000 that’s $7500. 

I just don’t know where to start or what to do. I don’t want to fuck this up like everything else I do. I want to use this to change my future. 
 
If I can turn $5000 into $10000 that’s not just getting my wants. That also can pay the few thousand it costs to go back to college and get my pre-reqs to get into my local technical colleges surgical tech program to start earning my degree for a good paying job. I know I can do it. I just need help. Please. 🙏🏻 
Thank you so much. Hell if any of you have a sure fire method I’d even pay you commission on my first profits if it works LOL.

\--------------------------------------------  
  
Kraft Heinz announced on September 2, 2025, that it will split into two separate publicly traded companies by the second half of **2026**. 

* One company, temporarily named **Global Taste Elevation Co.**, will focus on sauces, spreads, and shelf-stable meals, including brands like Heinz, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, and Kraft Mac & Cheese.
* The other company, temporarily named **North American Grocery Co.**, will focus on grocery staples, including brands like Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables.

\--------------------------------------------

<snippet from Forbes article, linked>

While the market sees potential for significant value creation if Kraft Heinz’s North American division achieves a meaningful turnaround, the current low single-digit growth expectations suggest it may not justify the approximately $20 billion valuation being attributed to it. However, RemainCo could benefit from a valuation uplift, given its portfolio of high-growth businesses.

Kraft Heinz’s restructuring mirrors a broader industry shift, similar to Kellogg’s 2023 split into Kellanova and WK Kellogg, which helped both companies grow independently. Since then, Kellanova’s stock rose 50.7%, WK Kellogg gained 72.1%, while Kraft Heinz’s shares dropped by 17.5% during the same period. Kraft Heinz has already demonstrated a willingness to pare down its portfolio through the divestment of non-core units, such as its Italian infant nutrition division, signalling that the potential spin-off is part of a larger recalibration of its brand ecosystem. With both Berkshire Hathaway stepping back from board involvement and 3G Capital having exited its stake by the end of 2023, it becomes easier for Kraft Heinz to take a bold step, such as a spin-off.",7,10,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joecornell/2025/09/08/kraft-heinz-to-split-into-two-companies/,new,Discussion,0.77

When a company pays out a dividend, something interesting happens to its stock price—it should fall by about the same amount as the dividend itself.

At least that’s how things normally work but in my opinion this logic does not apply to **beaten down stocks** that pay out a nice dividend. It’s my experience that these types of stocks do not fall by about the same amount of the dividend itself because they are considered cheap due to an underlying risk that usually relate to a lot of recent or current headwinds.

Yes, there is a lot of overlap and this is all equities. I think it'll perform roughly 12-13% returns over 35 years. I may adjust it to include REIT and/or Bond exposure later in life.

I use the dividends and distributions to either buy more shares or pay off debt. The traditional dividends can pay for more options shares and vice versa. The options section helps pay for my taxes, increases my shares for dividends, and gives me a little flexibility. I am aware of NAV risk and have invested in these for a while.

I’m starting investing from scratch again. I’m 38 and We have a 2 year old now and I realize now that time is such a valuable and limited resource. I make a livable wage with pretty high living expenses but over the past couple months I have been able to squirrel about $5k into a portfolio mostly in growth ETFs and some cash sitting in SGOV. 

For more context, I work in a government job and the benefits are great. I’ll have a pension, health savings account, and also a deferred compensation account that I’m putting a little money into every paycheck when I decide to retire.

My main question to you is about strategy. Would it be wise to grow my portfolio to a greater amount before changing my strategy to a dividend focus? Or is $5k enough to get started?

1nvagmv,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 10:56:28,200%+ dividend: ETCO,"This is Grayscale's new Ethereum covered call ETF. It makes sense that if BTCI and BITO are capturing Bitcoin volatility to pay out dividends, then Ethereum-based strategies would produce higher div, based on the much higher vol.

I doubt it will continue at this pace, but it's totally possible. And, speculating here, but I think there is a good chance ETH runs to $6k or even $8k by EOY / Q1 2026. Which could give a strong NAV boost and prevent decay for that much longer.

Yeah, it's probably equally as risky as yieldmax funds, but if you agree with the potential eth gains, it could be a money machine for a while. There's even an outside chance that eth and crypto have a multi year rally, which could really make this a cash cow. I guess worst case scenario is like 50% downside in the near term. But practically unlimited money if everything goes right. Or somewhere in between. That is all, best of luck to everyone.

1nva0ve,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 10:39:54,JEPI vs SPYI: Which Do You Like?,"Been comparing JEPI and SPYI lately since they both show up a lot when people talk about income ETFs. On the surface they look similar (covered call strategies with big yields) but the numbers and portfolios tell a different story from my analysis.

I created a hypothetical portfolio on Dividend Watch with $10k invested in both to get a sense of total returns, and other details my broker lacks for these securities.

[$10k comparison, including annual income differences](https://preview.redd.it/9bwoykqxhisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=50788313ebc101ae492cbadb2765eb6cfb9e044a)

If you had put $10K into each a year ago, the results aren’t the same. JEPI would have thrown off about $812 in income with an 8.4% yield, while SPYI would’ve paid closer to $1,200 with an 11.7% yield. Total return was also stronger for SPYI over that stretch.

Looking at dividends, JEPI’s story hasn’t been great. Payouts dropped from $6.36/share in 2022 to about $3.21 this year. That’s a downward trend that makes me cautious. SPYI, on the other hand, is newer but has been ramping up. It paid $1.89 in 2022, jumped to $5.79 in 2023, hit $6.12 in 2024, and even though 2025 is tracking lower at $4.04, the overall trajectory is still more encouraging than JEPI’s slide.

The holdings explain a lot. JEPI spreads things out — tech is its biggest sector but only around 20%, with healthcare, financials, and industrials right behind. SPYI leans more heavily into growth names: tech is over a third of the fund (34%), and then financials, consumer cyclical, and comm services make up most of the rest. It’s more tilted toward the S&P’s heavyweights.

[SPYI breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/ex8u2sr0iisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bd03a41f4bd3dcddbd969615cb16c6130c382c0)

[SPYI dividends](https://preview.redd.it/nhkhktr0iisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=215955f04f63c47077fb5269e4a2efc625291e8d)

[JEPI breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/35ufctr0iisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=65c196905bc91a6058b620e0bd8fa8eaf6e3cbc5)

So the trade-off looks something like this:

* JEPI is the more established, diversified option, but its shrinking payouts are a red flag.
* SPYI is newer and a bit more aggressive, with higher yield and stronger recent results, though its dividend history isn’t as long and the 2025 dip shows it won’t always be smooth sailing.

Curious where people here land... would you rather stick with JEPI’s track record, or take the higher yield and growth from SPYI even if it’s less tested?",49,49,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nva0ve/jepi_vs_spyi_which_do_you_like/,new,Discussion,0.88

Today closely checked BIZD holdings because PBDC is like actively managed and has more or less good BDCs with distributions in 5-10% range. So I've checked BIZD. And what the trick with bond allocation? 25%??? Is it normal for this fund? Does someone remember? I've tried to use Wayback Machine and see that few months ago it was more or less similar. Why they are doing this? At first i thought they raised cash to buy smth cheaper but it's passive fund, even active manage PBDC not doing this. I thought maybe it's to reduce volatility but it fell more than PBDC that don't have bonds at all (0.5 to 5%). So again why they are doing this? If they would convert this cash to every other BDC except of arcc and obdc as they already have giant position there they probably even get more yield (every bdc yields more than 4% tBill). So either I am missing smth very obvious like novices confuse \~14% expense ratio or it's just bad etf. Because I can buy on my own arcc+obdc+main+tBill. So anyone has some ideas? Thanks

I see lots of discussion around these relatively new income ETFs and have started looking into them more.  However, I came across some talk about how not all these ETFs use the same types of options.  Exchange traded options would be the safest, but there are also OTC options, ELNs, and swaps that are often used as well.  These are only as good as the counterparty to the contract. My understanding is that some of the ETFs have grown so large, that they wouldn't be able to get all the options needed through exchanges.  Or, in some cases, the premiums are too low on exchange options, so they seek out these other arrangements.

As we are currently in a bull market, everything has been humming along fine.  The risk is that if we have an event were there is another financial crisis or shock to the system, some of these counterparties could blow up.

1nsmj8i,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 08:00:06,ChatGPT is too generic for investment analysis,"I've been trying to use ChatGPT for investment research but keep hitting the same wall - it gives balanced, generic responses instead of how real investors actually think, plus it doesn't have access to current financial data.

For example, if I ask about Tesla:

  \- ChatGPT: ""Here are pros and cons to consider..."" (using outdated info)

  \- What Charlie Munger would probably say: ""Multiple kill-switches triggered - current debt ratio 2.1x, ROE dropped to 8.2%, avoid immediately""

The problem is ChatGPT is trained to be helpful and neutral, but legendary investors have strong opinions and specific methodologies. Plus it can't access real-time financials or recent news.

So I had this idea: what if someone built AI specifically trained on individual investors with live data integration? Like you could actually chat with:

  \- ""AI Charlie Munger"" using his kill-switch framework + current financials

  \- ""AI Warren Buffett"" applying his moat analysis + recent earnings

  \- ""AI Peter Lynch"" with his growth methodology + latest news

Even better - imagine a ""board meeting"" feature where all three analyze the same stock using current data and you see where they agree vs. disagree.

Key features I'm thinking:

  \- Real-time financial data (earnings, ratios, cash flow)

  \- Recent news integration and sentiment analysis

  \- Opinionated takes based on actual methodologies

  \- Multiple investor perspectives on same stock

  \- Portfolio upload for personalized analysis

I'd honestly pay $25-30/month for something like this vs. fighting with ChatGPT's outdated, generic responses.

Questions:

  1. Would real-time data integration make this significantly more valuable?

  2. What would you pay for specialized AI with live financial data vs. generic tools?

  3. Which legendary investors would you most want to ""chat"" with about current market conditions?

  4. Would you upload your portfolio for multi-investor analysis?

Anyone else frustrated with ChatGPT's limitations for current investment analysis?

Edit: For those asking about feasibility - the AI technology exists, and financial APIs are available. It's about combining them properly with authentic investor methodologies.",67,74,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nsmj8i/chatgpt_is_too_generic_for_investment_analysis/,new,Seeking Advice,0.8
1nskvny,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 06:24:58,Dividend investor in Europe: keep Realty Income ($O) or switch to EURO iSTOXX High Dividend Low Volatility 50 ETF?,"I’ve been dividend-investing for a bit and have held Realty Income ($O) for over a year. After digging into the tax side, I realized that in my country (Europe) dividends end up taxed at roughly \~42.5% even though the W-8BEN limits U.S. withholding to 15%.

Given that drag, I’m considering switching the position into an EU-domiciled ETF that tracks the **EURO iSTOXX® High Dividend Low Volatility 50** index to avoid the U.S. withholding and simplify taxes.

**ETF I’m looking at (example):**

* **Invesco EURO STOXX High Dividend Low Volatility UCITS ETF**
   * **Index:** EURO iSTOXX High Dividend Low Volatility 50
   * **ISIN:** IE00BZ4BMM98 — **Ticker:** EHDV (various exchanges)
   * **Structure:** UCITS, Ireland-domiciled, **distributing quarterly**
   * **Replication:** Physical, holds 50 stocks
   * **TER:** **0.30% p.a.**
   * **Fund size:** \~€202m
   * **Current dividend yield:** **\~5.2%**, last 12 months paid \~€1.57 per share (figures per justETF; date on their page Sept 2025)
   * Source: justETF profile; STOXX index page/factsheet. ([justETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BZ4BMM98))



1. For those in Europe facing high effective taxes on U.S. dividends: have you found **EU-domiciled UCITS dividend ETFs** (ideally **“reporting funds”** in your country) that deliver a **higher net-of-tax yield** than EHDV? Any favorites to compare?
2. My understanding is that **$O is a U.S. REIT/stock and not an Austrian-style “reporting fund (Meldefonds).”** If you’re in the EU/Austria, does moving from a U.S. single stock like $O to an **EU-domiciled UCITS reporting fund** materially improve your **after-tax** income?
3. Are there **better products for pure income** (e.g., other EURO STOXX/Europe high-dividend strategies, or even all-Europe high-dividend low-volatility variants) that historically offer a **higher distribution yield** than EHDV without taking on excessive risk?
4. Anything I’m missing re: **withholding tax, tax credits, or broker handling** that would change the O vs. EU-dividend-ETF calculus?

I been thinking about my financial situation.

No credit cards anymore.  19,000 invested making 120 monthly income 73,000 in student loans 30K of that is at 6.8% and the rest are MUCH lower rates around 3-4%

My plan WAS to just grow my monthly income to help cover income based payment.  I make about 45K a year and save EVERYTHING.  Rent is about 800, I own my own old Honda so its reliable with some typical repairs nothing to major.

However I have been thinking about switching my plan.  I have been investing about 800-1200 each month now as that 19K invested started the year around 4 so most of it is VERY recent growth.

Would investing in QQQI and SPYI covered calls ETF's be a win in my situation? 60 cents of monthly income on a 53 buck investment.  I was thinking next two years If I can pump 50,000 into them  THEN I will have a $600 revenue stream that I can then focus on buying SCHD 600 dollars worth every month and then turn my focus to paying down that 30K at 6.8% intrest.

What would you do in my situation.  I have great job but the pay is rather low but I live in a low cost area so it works fine for me. is covered calls ETF's to good to be true? I'm 39 now about to be 40 so I got a good 20 years before I start to retire by going part time. likely will always keep working to some extent cause getting paid to move my body is a good thing I'd say.. even if it's part time in my 70's if I live that long I still want to be bringing in income but I don't want to wait until im 55 to start investing.. idk.. am I doing it wrong? Can't change the past and not get this scam of a degree but what is done is done..

  
EDIT im current in the save plan so don't have to make a payment until 2028 but might start paying the interest on those 30K of the 73K loan amount. ",5,6,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nrjckj/what_would_you_do/,new,Discussion,0.86

1nrfd7k,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 18:49:06,Advice for 20yr old college student investing with the intent of paying off school,"I’m a 20 (21 soon) year old year sophomore in college who’s gaining monthly income from government benefits. Very fresh and green into investing but I’ve been trying to learn as much as I can recently.

The benefits have been very useful to have during school since I can’t fit in a job without sacrificing a lot of time. However these benefits are only active during the school year. I want to start investing as early as possible to help build long term wealth, but my primary goal is to help pay off school loans. Those loans being priced around $60k not taking into account interest, which fortunately is low. I’m graduating June of 2028. I’m going to school for art , my current career trajectory is looking like becoming a freelancer in editorial and children’s books.

I thought about dividends mostly for the fact that they’d be able to help during times I’m not receiving income during summer (family reasons), which would allow me to DRIP during that time so I’m at least putting in something rather than nothing.

With that being said, I’d be able to invest $200 a month during the school year... September through December, and January through end of April. I’ve been thinking about putting $100 into VOO as a solid foundation for long term sake starting with a growth ETF, then $50 into SCHD to dip my toes in but I’ve heard people on this subreddit saying that’s better for retirement. With the last $50 I thought about putting it into a company stock, maybe holding a slice of Costco.

Would dividends make sense for my personal circumstances or should I focus on a different build?I’m sorry for the noob questions but I’m at the point where I’m trying to think about my future and how rough the job market is and how that would impact me paying off my loans.

Any help, honest critique and feedback would be very beneficial. Thank u",1,1,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nrfd7k/advice_for_20yr_old_college_student_investing/,new,Seeking Advice,1.0

It seems like a good middle ground between maximizing growth, total returns and generating retirement income. Also I believe its income is more stable than the income from CC ETFs. If we look through the dividend history of SPY since inception, the dividends decreased in only 3 out of 31 years (09 being the worst at -20%, 05 -2.2%, 01 -5.5%). I assume that QDPL’s dividends (which are supposed to be 4x of S&P 500) would behave same way though I don’t fully understand future contracts to be 100% confident about that. What would be the risk in a retirement strategy with QDPL as the core holding?  
For example: 90% QDPL, 10% Bonds / Cash for those occasional ~1/10 years when dividends decrease. The high/ish expense ratio could be offset by reduced bond  exposure. No need to sell any shares but occasionally when market does really well, you could rebalance or sell some shares to get back to 90/10 (or other desired allocation).

I currently have some IVV, VDHG, FANG+ & IEU. These all pay a small dividend but not a lot.

My question is basically, what is everyone's opinions on the below funds. The top 3 are the funds I'm leaning towards for real dividend gains.

SCHD - US Stocks
VAS - AUS share index
ZYAU - S&P/ASX 200 Dividend ETF

SCHY

My monthly salary is RM1,800. I can allocate RM1,000 for investments. Since I live with my parents, I don't have to pay for rent. I rarely go out with friends ( don't have any friends🥲) I don't drink, or waste some money. My favorite is Gaming, so if I got day off I just stay at home and play some games.

Here the catch my budget=

-RM1,000 for investments
-RM300 for myself (subscriptions, cravings, leisure)
-RM200 for household bills (electricity, water, food)
-RM200 for my parents (filial piety)
-RM100 for an emergency fund

1npkv65,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 15:01:57,When should I change my strategy from growth to dividends,"Hey there, straight to the point but I am not the type of person willing to invest in dividend stocks his entire life for some reasons that I'll explain so I would like to know if there's an ""optimal age"" to change strategies. Let me explain my reasoning.

Okay dividend stocks are safer because they are usually more stable companies (longer track record of being profitable, dividend kings are not a thing for no reason I guess). But they offer less growth opportunity, so my current plan is going all in on growth stocks until the age of 40 something then progressively transfer my portfolio to dividend stocks but I would like to get your reasoning because I did some calculations and I don't understand dividend-only people's reasoning (not to criticize, maybe I am the one who's wrong) as the average growth promoted by growth-investors is 10%/year but dividends people tend more to talk about a realistic 6% growth per year + 2% dividends on their side.

So my calculations started there, suppose I invest 100$ a month during 7 years only, the difference is already big:

\- 100$ in growth stocks at 10% yearly growth: [Calculation for growth portfolio](https://www.dunefolio.com/calculator?starting_capital=10000&growth_rate=10&dividends_rate=0&duration=84&monthly_investment=100&yearly_investment=0)

\- 100$ in dividend stocks at 6% yearly growth + 2% dividends: [Calculations for dividends portfolio](https://www.dunefolio.com/calculator?starting_capital=10000&growth_rate=6&dividends_rate=2&duration=84&monthly_investment=100&yearly_investment=0)

Which ends up with 25,000$ for the dividends portfolio and 28,000$ for the growth one.

And I mean you don't even need advanced math, the yearly return is just 10% vs. 8%, the calculation only highlights the gap.

Indeed my point is I don't get it, what is the ultimate advantage to being 'dividend only'.

To further clarify, I am a long-term investor (am yet to sell a single share of a single stock) and view these investment accounts as my retirement fund (40ish years down the road).

After doing some more research into the tax benefits of a ROTH IRA I am now faced with this question: should I group all of dividend paying stocks (with DRIP investing) into my ROTH IRA - as I will not be taxed on any dividend payments over the next 40ish years (assuming I do not sell anything in this account till I turn 64 or whatever age the tax-break rule is amended to by then)? 

Then I would group the majority of my growth stocks into my personal investment account (no dividends = no yearly dividend taxes) - that way the only taxes I would pay in this account would be the capital gains taxes when I decide to sell a couple decades down the road?

Or does the real value of a ROTH IRA lay in the fact that capital gains aren’t taxed either (if I pick a stock that goes 50x over the next 40 years in my ROTH, I would not be taxed on any of those gains)?

Coupling dividends with modest growth has been such a solid strategy for me to keep consistent with investing. I do not panic sell and I do not look at my portfolio everyday to see what the market is doing. 

My biggest positions are the SP500, NASDAQ100 and TSX60 with a few individual companies and covered call ETFs. All positions are attached. 

My goal for now is honestly maintaining a 2.5% yield and getting out of individual companies slowly. Yeah sure its high risk high reward, but I have realized I suck at stock picking and a 80% ETF portfolio would be great. Also getting the covered call ETF portion of my portfolio to 10% would be great. Currently its at \~12%.

Chart go up or chart go down, I buy. Dividends take the stress out and let me focus on other things like how to generate more money to invest etc.

I’ve been hearing so many things about benefits vs downsides of SPYI/QQQI, XYLG/QYLG, and GPIX/GPIQ. And it’s all scattered across the internet I’ve yet to find anything that breaks down the pros and cons with any sort of logic/thought train. I know they’re all high yielders but what is the “best” combo for a taxable brokerage used to supplement income?

I like the Global X funds (XLYG/QYLG) but I think just because of the title “Covered Call & Growth”, implying that besides a hefty payout the funds itself appreciate in NAV. Then the QQQI/SPYI seems to have at least some of the distributions treated as ROC instead of dividends (which would be better in a non-retirement brokerage account). Then GPI Q/X just seem like copy cats of all the same covered call strategies. Ideally I’d like growth and income (wouldn’t we all) but wondering if the naming convention on the Global X funds is misleading me... 

These are just 6 examples of hundreds, I know. Because there’s also JEPQ/JEPI… 🤦🏻‍♂️ they seem to have a longer history and decent stability…. HELP.

My questions is, would you consider both of these falling under a yield trap?  Or do they hold up as viable long-term cash-flow plays for someone bullish on Bitcoin?

My thinking is that even if the capital erodes, as long as the cash flow is strong, I can ride it out.

I am a young investor (29) and am also a high income healthcare worker that earns over $300K per year combined with my wife. We are trying to create reliable passive income streams to replace our income over time without worrying about market value, 4% rule, etc. 

I understand that many investors do not like CEFs from a tax perspective, as these funds are required to pay out 95% of earnings as taxable dividends to shareholders. As a result, the market value/appreciation may be flat for a very long time. There is also leverage and fees to be aware of. 

However, I also understand that if passive income is the goal, these investments would help meet that goal as opposed to the Bogleheads “VOO and chill” approach that many financial planners recommend. 

On another note, I follow some knowledgeable investors in the CEF space like Steven Bavaria and Steve Selengut, who make the comparison to a “department store”, where you can buy CEFs at a discount and sell them for profit later on to capture some gains. This creates an additional income stream on top of the regular dividend distributions.

IRA

* $2604 SWTSX
* $576 SWISX
* $535 SFENX

TSP - Approximately $10,000 all in the C fund (like the S&P 500)

Taxable Brokerage - $500 with some higher conviction individual stock picks.

Have a HYSA with $500 contributing $1000 a month to establish an emergency fund and earmarked for whenever my car eventually craps the bed. Also Have another $1000 in SPAXX money market account that I am not sure how to utilize.

1nnz87l,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 17:30:58,Research For Success,"I mean no disrespect to anyone, but I'm amazed at how many people ask ""what should I do"" in regards to their portfolios or what they should buy or sell. 

Do the research, learn how the markets work, learn the indicators to help you make a decision, and go forward.

When I first started seriously investing for retirement when I was in my early 30s, I had no clue how the markets worked. So I started reading & learning...and this was before internet resources were available. I had our funds at a brokerage where an agent made the buying & selling decisions for us. Soon learned that the vast majority of investors made the decisions over what to buy and sell even using a firm, and I recognized I had started doing that too.

So I cancelled the managed account and transferred holdings to a discount brokerage, E-Trade. I later left E-Trade and now have been with Schwab for over 30 years, and they are great.

I haven't asked anyone for advice for over 35 years now and rely on my own knowledge, experience, and confidence on buying & selling.

When I was 36 & wife was 34, we had $5,000 to our name and were about $18,000 in debt. We are now 70 & 68 and own our home ($650k) debt free with about $1.4M in retirement accounts with $400,000 in Roths. No other debt at all.

While we both did have a 401k with our respective employers, they were immediately rolled to Schwab IRAs when we retired. We started the Roths separately.

I've made mistakes in the past and will likely make mistakes in the future, but mistakes are what you learn from and help make future success.

I implore everyone to start studying finance and investing and have the confidence in your decisions. Most of the folks posts I read in r/dividends give a lot of advice, but are wrong in the comments they make. Not everyone, as some commenters are very aware and knowledgeable, but a larger percentage are clueless.

After I left the managed brokerage, I've never listened to anyone who said...you should buy this...or...you own that!!?!...you should sell. Conversely, I've never recommended to anyone else what they should buy, even when they asked my advice. Instead, I tried to give them the tools to make those decisions themselves. 

The only advice I gave to a friend was back in 2007/8 when markets were getting ready to tank and the real estate bubble burst. I told him I sold everything and saved several $100,000 in losses. He said.. ""why didn't you tell me?"" I said, ""I did, you chose to ignore me.""  The market indicators just worried me then and I luckily made the decision to get out. It didn't take long before I did some bottom feeding and got back in. 

Once again, learn how the system works and be confident in your decisions. Don't rely on another person to qualify your decisions...be confident!!

1nnyxwd,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 17:19:19,New dividend investor - Are O and PFLT good dividend stocks?,"Hello, I have been an investor for about 10 years. Making good money in tech stocks. 

I am looking to move a portion of my portfolio into dividend stocks but I have no idea how to evaluate these companies. It is very different to evaluating companies in the tech sector. 

After talking with the AI it has recommended me O (Realty Income Corp) and PFLT (Pennantpark Floating Rate Capital Ltd). 

My current criteria for evaluating dividend stocks are low fluctuation in stock price, never or rarely decreasing a dividend (preferably increasing the dividend), not cutting dividend during bear markets. 

What else should I be looking for when looking into dividend stocks? 

Any specific stock recommendations?

* **Monthly Income (Funds that pay the same every month) - includes -15% withholding tax on U.S. funds:**
   * $PREF.TO (Preferred Split Corp. Fund of Funds) - 6.49% yield
   * $HDIF (Harvest Fund of Funds) - 10% yield
   * $PDIV (Non-Leverage, Dividend + option) - 12% yield
   * $PDI (Global Debt/Loans) - 11% yield
   * $YYY (Multiple Income Fund of Funds (mostly Blackrock)) - 10% yield



* **Quarterly Hikers (dividend growth companies) includes -15% withholding tax on U.S. stocks:**
   * $OZK (Financial | hikes: 1,4,7,10) - 2.8% yield (each hike: +2%)
   * $HESM (Midstream | hikes: 2,5,8,11) - 7% yield (each hike: +1-4%)
   * $EQB.TO (Financial | hikes: 3,6,9,12) - 2.3% yield(each hike: +3-5%)

Honestly, I just like these, but the increase in every payout is nice to see as well.

I want to set and forget it forever like a trust fund.,"TLDR: Didn’t like how much I still had to manage with the traditional FIRE portfolio. Want my income to truly be passive. Dumped VTI/VEU for SCHD/SCHY. (Both US and Int’l index fund pairs). Will instruct my brokerage to disallow access to my portfolio.

—

Long story long, I was realizing that for the last six years, I was stressing myself out doing research on withdrawal methods, withdrawal rates, how to adjust withdrawals in an up market and the down market and learning about all of those methodologies, asset, allocation, bonds, sequence of withdrawal risk, etc. Every time I did research, I wanted to tinker and adjust my portfolio based on a new philosophy, and I’m getting really tired of it.

I have to open my portfolio every time I want to sell my stocks to make a withdrawal and that just encourages me to tinker. It’s just my personality. I can’t do anything about it. This also encouraged me to react to the market because I could see my entire network going up and down every time I open my portfolio.

A few days ago I literally just dumped my entire portfolio into two dividend ETFs because I am realizing how much I value simplicity and I want to set up my investments like basically a set it and forget it trustfund that pays me every month. I will also be instructing my brokerage to not allow me to have online access unless I go into a physical brokerage to make it harder for me to trade. Especially seeing as I live outside of the United States and I would have to take a flight back to place a trade or adjust my portfolio.

I’m sort of looking at this like a trust fund that is being managed by the corporations who choose to pay me dividends and they adjust how much they pay me in the markets and the markets based on the health of their companies and the economy.

I wanted a simple US dividend fund and a simple international dividend fund. I tried to wait the allocation roughly with the weight of VT (total world market fund) so it’s about 60/40.

Thoughts? Knowing I want to keep things simple and tinker free. Anything inherently wrong with this? I know I could probably diversify into different sectors and this and that but again I really don’t want to do any more research. 

I just want my money to work for me and give me passive income. It’s the whole reason I wanted to save money so I never have to think about it again. 

Portfolio size is….substantial. Schwab investment income puts it at roughly $27,000/ month (before tax) and I would be okay with dividends getting cut in half for a bit so long as I know I won’t go to zero and that the income will eventually recover. Im not adding this to brag but to give context. I probably spend like $10k/month on myself. The rest goes into savings for fun spending. So in down years I would just cut down on some of the fun and luxury.

[https://snowball-analytics.com/](https://snowball-analytics.com/) \- 8/10 - Really good if you want more in depth analytics on your computer, but the mobile version isn't my favorite and their premium version feels a little overpriced.

DivTracker (the palm tree one) - 7/10 - I like this one because its free and pretty generous, but its the only one with ads which you can pay to have removed. It has all the analytics and features you'd expect and feels good on the phone. Link: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dividend-tracker-stock-market/id1564179613](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dividend-tracker-stock-market/id1564179613)

[https://thedividendtracker.com/](https://thedividendtracker.com/) \- 0/10 - I downloaded the mobile version and could not figure out for the life of me how to add stocks to the portfolio, you might need to do it on the web version, idk

[https://divtracker.app/](https://divtracker.app/) \- 7/10 - This one is just a super solid and robust choice, they don't have anything fancy, but it does what it does super well and the premium version is a good deal.

[https://stockevents.app/](https://stockevents.app/) \- 9/10 - This has been a long time favorite of mine. I really like how they did their mobile app, it feels very polished and high quality. I also like their web version a ton. Great app especially if you want to track all the different dividend events (such as earnings, ex dates, and more). The only thing holding it back is there was no brokerage linking for the paid version and you could only set one goal at a time.

[https://plainzer.com/](https://plainzer.com/) \- 7/10 - There is no IOS version of the app that I could find and the android version felt a bit basic, but the web version was very clean and had all the features you'd expect from a good dividend tracking tool.

[https://trackyourdividends.com/](https://trackyourdividends.com/) \- 6/10 - No mobile version at all and the web version is pretty basic, not that being super basic is bad, it does have a very clean and minimalistic view that feels nice to look at.

[https://delta.app/en](https://delta.app/en) \- 7/10 - I have only tried their mobile app and thought it was really good, it is more of a general portfolio tracker, less focused on dividends but still really solid choice.

[https://divstash.app/](https://divstash.app/) \- 10/10 - This app is newer, but this is my new favorite tracking app. It feels a lot like Stock Events, but the premium version comes with brokerage linking. Also because I am a super goal oriented investor I really enjoy how they let you create multiple super customized goals for your portfolio. Its also run by just one guy so its really impressive what he has done. (They also just added it to Android)

There were other options that I also tried out but none of them were really good enough to be added to the list.

TL;DR Same result as last time: [https://divstash.app/](https://divstash.app/) and [https://stockevents.app/](https://stockevents.app/) are my personal favorite apps with DivStash being better for me because of highly customizable goals and automatic portfolio tracking, the only reason I would go with another option would be if you want super in depth portfolio analytics on the web version then I would go with [https://snowball-analytics.com/](https://snowball-analytics.com/)

(All the apps are free too)

Again these are all just my opinions after trying each app.

So [https://divstash.app/](https://divstash.app/) is my winner, but I am curious what you guys think.",68,43,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nl4p4v/dividend_tracking_apps_ranked_updated/,new,Opinion,0.93

Initially, my UNH weighting was lower (I began DCA when it was around $270), but its weighting has increased recently due to gains.

I have enough cash now to pay off the heloc but I can't help but wonder if it would be better to just put this cash in QQQI and use the dividends to make the payments on the heloc.  Right now it's just in a MMF earning 4% which is about 450 a month.

At 100k into qqqi it would generate roughly 14k a year in dividends. I'd like to preserve capital as much as possible if I did need to sell shares for cash to pay off the heloc.  It's also possible I may sell my house in the future in which case the heloc would get paid off anyway.

Curious if anyone has any thoughts on this or has done something similar.  If I didn't need the cash at all I would just stick it in an index fund and call it a day but I'm just trying to find a way to make the payments to free up cash for other wants/needs. 

I guess the other argument would be to pay off the heloc and if I needed cash I could always just borrow from the heloc.  It's nice having the cash in my account though. ",3,20,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nkvvgg/heloc_and_qqqi/,new,Discussion,0.6

1nkch3r,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 12:08:41,JEPI vs JEPQ Detailed Breakdown,"Been digging into JEPI and JEPQ the past few days since they’re some of the most talked about covered call ETFs right now. Both kick out high yields, but once looking closer, they’re built pretty differently.

I built a hypothetical portfolio in Dividend Watch to run some numbers that my broker doesn't really provide, and there are some interesting takes.

On yield alone, JEPQ looks like the winner. It’s paying around 10.7% right now ($6.08/share annually), compared to JEPI at about 8.4% ($4.78/share). But the payout history flips the story a bit. JEPI’s income has been trending down. It was paying $6.36 back in 2022 and it’s tracking closer to $3.21 so far this year. JEPQ’s gone the other direction, climbing from $3.85 in 2022 to a little over $6 annually today. So JEPI feels like it’s slipping, while JEPQ’s been showing some growth.

The portfolios explain a lot of the difference. JEPI spreads things out: tech is the biggest slice at about 20%, but healthcare, financials, and industrials are all in that same ballpark. It feels more balanced, like a fund designed not to swing too wildly if one sector struggles. JEPQ is basically a concentrated Nasdaq income play. Over half of it is tech, and then another 30% is tied up in communication services and consumer cyclical. If tech’s hot, you’re golden. If not, you’re going to feel it.

So the trade-off seems pretty clear:

* JEPI = diversified and steadier, but the shrinking payouts raise questions.
* JEPQ = higher yield and actual dividend growth, but it’s a much bigger bet on tech.

I can see the case for holding both, but personally I’m leaning toward JEPQ if I’m chasing income and JEPI if I want something a little less tied to Nasdaq performance.

1nk4xlt,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 06:47:19,Dividend Growth vs High Yield — Are We Underestimating the Long-Term Power of Yield on Cost?,"Lately, I've been running long-term projections comparing dividend growth strategies with high-yield income plays, and I keep hitting an interesting paradox. Most people warn against chasing high yields, saying it's better to focus on companies with lower current yields but strong dividend growth.

But when I model this using yield on cost  and reinvested dividends, compounding from even modest growth rates completely flips the script over multi-decade timeframes.

Here's what I keep seeing:

\-High-growth dividend stocks (7–10% CAGR) usually start at 1–2% yield and trade at rich multiples.

\-High-yield stocks (6–9%) usually have flat or zero growth, but give me immediate cash to reinvest elsewhere.

\-Assuming full reinvestment, the closest point in my models between these two strategies is often around years 12–15.

So my core question is:

Are we underestimating the long-term power of YOC and dividend growth compounding, or overestimating the risk of high-yield sustainability?

I’d love to hear from other dividend-focused investors:

\-How do you model this trade-off between current yield and future dividend growth?

\-Does anyone currently run long-term (20+ years) backtests comparing DGI vs high yield portfolios?

I-s a “hybrid” portfolio (3–4% initial yield + 5–6% growth) the sweet spot, or just a compromise that underperforms both?

Dividends etfs have quality holdings, but all have poor yeilds (IDVO and DIVO mix are the highest yeild that pay monthly, yet they are still very low considering 30% tax on the dividends for people in my situation).

Thus, I present the below allocation as this etf allocation, in my view, is the safest, provides the highest monthly yeild, and with limited to no NAV erosion:

- HIGH 50% (80% of NAV is in treasury bills, the strategy uses options to increase the yeild) - yeild is around 7%
- SBAR 25% (barrier strategy, set at 30% below the market price on the put option date, the risk of breaking the barrier is 6% as per Simply, which is low) - yeild is around 10% 
- SPYI 12.5% (covered calls on S&P, it performed very well since Inception and expected to sustain its NAV long term) - yeild is around 11.7%
- XV 12.5% (similar strategy to SBAR, but the target yeild is 15% which is the fixed part of the equation while the barrier level is the variable, risker but worth the risk) - yeild is around 15%

The weighted average yeild is 9.3%. Even after interest rates drop to normal levels, the yeild would not be lower than 8% while half of the portfolio is in treasuries, 25% has a deep spot rate that makes it very low risk, and the rest (25%) is linked to S&P and broad market indexes (NASDAQ, S&P, and Russle 1000).

These etfs are very recently established, and we do not know how will they perform long term. 

Testfol.io gave me 0.68 beta which is very low and close to an all weather fund like AOA.

Am I doing this correctly?,"Im trying to build dividend income and im focused on the monthly projected income.  I do use the yearly divd income /12.  Invested about 18K and now have a projected income of 115! I been investing a lot recently so actual gains are much lower given recent investments.

My goal is to have 50 positions all with 2%  however REITS and ETF's are already diversified so likely will progress towards a 50-60 in ETF's and REITS while the rest in individual stocks each with around 2%.

TGT I thought was a great value under 100 so I loaded up higher and I really love SPG busniness which is why I went heavy with them..

It's a newer account so im not to worried about being exactly balanced, but as I build it to 100K I want to get closer and closer to it being well balance and at the correct percentages.

Recently unloaded PSEC and HRZN will be deleting them off the list for 2026 and reorganzing it better as well. Lots of additions this year so it does look a bit messy. Percentages are listed on the left side.

I am 40 so I plan on building it over the next 20 years and in that time will consider going down in hours to 32 hours and after 60 might see about even fewer hours and more PTO and days off.

Plan is to go for high divd return with SOME divd growth stocks but overall will plan on taking out max of 80% divid income and keep reinvesting 20% to keep the income growing to keep up with rising costs. but yea.

Good holdings? Bad positions? idk.. what yall think?

1nisaxv,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 16:09:31,Top 3 dividend/growth plays from my portfolio (+ 1 joker pick),"I would love to hear everybody else's answers to the 2 questions below which are two of the most common questions I get as a value/dividend investor.

1. Which are your best dividend stocks right now when you look at total growth (dividends + dividend growth + stock price appreciation)?
2. Do you DRIP?

 Here are my own answers:

The quick answer to question no. 2 is: No, I don’t DRIP. In this post I’ll focus on question no. 1, but I’ve also shared a link to an older post here where I go into detail about my dividend strategy and why I don’t DRIP.

Getting back to question no. 1: The enclosed screenshot is a snapshot from my IBKR (Interactive Brokers) account showing some of my dividend positions and how they’ve done over the past 4–5 years:

**Important note:**

1. The performance of the tickers below only reflects unrealised gains and does not include the dividends I’ve received along the way, so the actual total return is higher.
2. I have owned several of these stocks on and off during the past 24 years. The positions mentioned below have alI been initiated within the past 3-5 years, with the exception of HSBC which I have only owned since April '25. I have been adding to most of the positions below during corrections — latest in April ’25.

The following 3 have been some of my favourite Total Growth dividend stocks:

**UNM: +185% (6.5% YOC)**  
Boring old insurer, very under the radar, but valuation was low and returns have been excellent.

**ABBV: +169% (8.1% YOC)**  
Big pharma cash flow machine. Humira decline was a concern but the pipeline and new drugs have carried growth.

**SPG: +130% (8.1% YOC)**  
Class-A malls and outlets. They bounced back strong after COVID and have kept raising the dividend.

And then a joker pick outside the screenshot is **RITM**, yielding 8.0% right now. I owned it pre-pandemic and took a loss, but post-pandemic it might actually be my best performer. I re-entered at $4.33 in April ’20, and most recently added 4,000 shares at $9.77 in April ’25. The quarterly dividends are remarkable and add a lot of dry powder every three months.

RITM is a mREIT with a broad engine (MSRs, credit, servicing). It can be volatile, but the dividend has held up well. I also expect a dividend increase and/or a potential spinoff of the NewRez division, which could unlock further value for investors in 2026. RITM has also structured and hedged its business intelligently, making it less sensitive to interest rate changes.

Another great dividend-paying stock which has been winning my heart lately is HSBC. I had wanted to own it for quite a while and finally bought in on April 7th during the tariff scare at $48.36 (2.2% YOC). Since then it has gone up 43%.

**HSBC** is one of the world’s largest banks with a strong footprint in Asia, the UK, and global wealth management. Rising rates and cost discipline have boosted earnings, and capital returns have improved with consistent dividend hikes and buybacks. For me it’s a solid play with global diversification, and I see further upside as they keep simplifying the business and focusing on higher-return markets.

That’s my take. I do own several other great dividend-paying value stocks, REITs and BDCs, but that’s another story.

**I would love to hear how others here would answer those two questions:**

1. **Which dividend stocks have given you the best total growth the past few years?**
2. **And do you DRIP, or not — and why?**

Here is the link to my previous post which also includes my views on DRIP, and my dividend and reinvestment strategy:

Lately, I keep seeing AI investing tools claiming crazy stuff like 30% annual returns with zero effort.

Honestly, I haven’t tried any of them, because they feel more like marketing than actual investing.

I know AI can be powerful at analyzing trends better than humans, but I don’t think it’s there yet.

I like the idea behind magnifi.com what they do is speed up your research on stocks.

It won’t decide for you, but it helps you dig into information on the internet quickly and saves you time.

Other than this, I don’t trust AI to fully manage my hard-earned money.

But I also wonder: why would I pay for subscriptions when there are tons of free newsletters like Morning Brew (their investing edition)

which can give me timely analysis and cut down the time and effort I’d spend?

Personally, I like [Thevale ](https://linkly.link/2F5HO) because their analysis is 60% visual, so it’s easier for me to grasp the idea.

Let’s be honest we won’t invest in every analysis we read. That’s why I prefer their visual-first content: if I’m interested, I’ll dig deeper.

I’m curious to know how you guys feel about the future of AI, and especially how it’s being marketed.

1ni79i5,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 23:53:30,"You have $2,500 what to buy that will pay that back in dividends the shortest time?"," Curious on your take…

Here’s Grok’s answer:

To recover your $2,500 investment through dividends in the shortest time, prioritize investments with the highest dividend yields, as the payback period is calculated as 1 divided by the yield (expressed as a decimal), assuming dividends remain constant. This ignores factors like taxes, reinvestment, or changes in dividend payments.

Based on recent data, business development companies (BDCs) and REITs offer some of the highest yields. The top option is Prospect Capital Corp. (PSEC), with a trailing dividend yield of 20.36% as of September 6, 2025. 44 This corresponds to an annualized dividend of $0.72 per share (paid monthly at $0.06 per share). To arrive at the payback period: convert the yield to a decimal (0.2036), then divide 1 by 0.2036, resulting in approximately 4.91 years.
With $2,500, you could purchase around 920 shares at the recent price of about $2.72 per share (prices fluctuate, so confirm current pricing). Annual dividend income would be roughly $509 ($2,500 × 0.2036), recovering the principal in under 5 years if dividends hold steady.

Other high-yield alternatives include:
	•	ARMOUR Residential REIT Inc. (ARR): Yield of 19.22% as of mid-September 2025. 54 Payback period: 1 / 0.1922 ≈ 5.20 years.
	•	Horizon Technology Finance Corp. (HRZN): Yield of 19.27% as of mid-September 2025. 40 Payback period: 1 / 0.1927 ≈ 5.19 years.
	•	Oxford Square Capital Corp. (OXSQ): Yield of 19.27% as of mid-September 2025. 29 Payback period: 1 / 0.1927 ≈ 5.19 years.

For a more diversified option, consider the Invesco KBW Premium Yield Equity REIT ETF (KBWY) with a yield of 9.28% as of September 2, 2025. 11 Payback period: 1 / 0.0928 ≈ 10.78 years. This is longer but may carry lower company-specific risk.

Yields can change, and ultra-high yields often reflect higher volatility or potential dividend cuts—review the latest financials before investing.

**Scenario:** My wife and I are both over 65, with her drawing SSI and work retirement, and me still working, which I will likely do until 70 and then take full SSI. We have approximately $750k in retirement funds, plus real estate and other investments. This question is solely about risk/reward and income from the retirement pool of funds.

**Big question**: Among various options like annuities, I have looked at placing a lump sum of \~$550k in PDI, the leveraged fixed income Closed End Fund from PIMCO, the Dynamic Income Fund, that yields, based on current price, 13.3% and pays monthly and has paid a similar dividend without interruption since 2012.

**Desired Outcome:** This would give us income of \~$6k per month, which meets the threshold of income we need to be able to save almost all of my earnings. Not concerned about total return, just the steady income.

1nhzad1,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 17:50:54,"First $100k, 5 years in","36yom investing seriously for 5 years in a Roth IRA and Roth 457b

I’ve had my 457b for 10 years, but I was only throwing nickels and dimes at it. I had $7,000 in it 5 years ago when I began taking my retirement seriously. 

My Roth IRA is roughly: 25% QQQ, 25% VTI, 25% VIG, 22% SCHD, less than 2% MSFT & DGRO

My Roth 457b is roughly: 53% SV-COM (state street S&P 500), 22% V0128A (MFS International blend), 8% DFFVX, 6% LMOIX, 4% ANCFX, 3% VERIX, 1% BAGSX, BGRFX, NVLIX, and PORT (empower guaranteed portfolio)

I’ve self invested my Roth IRA, and my Roth 456b is robo invested through empower. The 457b is purely growth, they don’t offer any dividend plays. My IRA I’m balancing both growth (QQQ) and dividends (the rest). I had been running a 25/25/25/25 with QQQ, VTI, VIG, and SCHD for awhile. I bought MSFT with Schwab slices to make sure I was as close to 100% invested as I could be (you can’t buy dividends on stock slices). Lately I’ve been slightly less pleased with how SCHD has been performing and have begun adding DGRO. 

In the last 5 years I’ve also been able to buy a home, travel, eat out, etc. I’ve done all of this while pulling in roughly $100k a year. 

My plan is to retire at 60 and turn my IRA into a full dividend account and never touch the nest egg as I draw down my 457b and collect my pension. My pension is small, but I don’t have to fund it at all. It should be roughly mid $30k a year based on what I make now. 

I see a ton of people posting on here with million dollar accounts and for regular people I think it’s hard to relate. I wanted to show even working class people who are consistent can live good, and make investment gains. They say your first $100k takes the longest, here’s hoping to get another $100k in less than 5.

1nhm7fz,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 09:42:36,Looking to Diversify My VOO-SCHD Portfolio with Some International Flavor,"I’ve been rocking a 50/50 split between VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF) and SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF) for a while, and it’s been pretty solid. VOO gives me exposure to the big U.S. market for growth, and SCHD brings in steady dividends from companies with strong fundamentals, like solid payout ratios and consistent earnings. It’s been a nice balance for making money and keeping some income flowing, even when the market gets wild.

But lately, I’m feeling like my portfolio’s too focused on the U.S. With inflation sticking around, global politics getting messy, and U.S. stocks looking a bit pricey, I’m thinking about diversifying to spread out my risk and maybe boost my returns. I’m looking at international ETFs like VEU (Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US) or IDEV (iShares Core MSCI International Developed Markets) to add some global flavor while still keeping dividends coming in. I’d love to keep my overall yield above 2.5% after any changes.

I’m considering moving 20-30% of my money into something like VWO (Vanguard Emerging Markets) for a shot at higher growth, but I’m a bit worried about currency swings, so maybe a hedged option makes sense. From some quick math, this kind of shift could help my portfolio take less of a hit during rough patches, which sounds pretty good.
So, what do you all think? Any international dividend ETFs you’ve been liking lately? Got any favorites in developed or emerging markets? Are you doing anything specific, like focusing on high-quality or less volatile stocks, to manage risk? And how do you balance going global versus sticking with the U.S. market’s strength?

I’m a European investor (using Interactive Brokers) and I’m trying to build a simple dividend-focused ETF portfolio for cash flow. I’d especially love to hear from other **European dividend investors** since UCITS funds and tax treatment can be quite different from the U.S. market.

I’ve been looking at these three UCITS ETFs:

* **TDIV UCITS** – VanEck Morningstar Developed Markets Dividend Leaders
* **IDVY UCITS** – iShares Euro Dividend
* **SPYD UCITS** – SPDR S&P U.S. Dividend Aristocrats

All three ETFs are UCITS, which is important for EU investors, and together they give me exposure across global, European, and U.S. markets. They also pay dividends quarterly, and when combined, they provide income in six different months of the year: March, April, June, July, September, and October (with all three paying in December).

My goal is to build a portfolio that provides reliable cash flow without heavy NAV erosion, while maintaining diversification across regions and keeping things simple with just three funds.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on whether this 3-ETF combo makes sense for a dividend-focused EU investor, and if there are better UCITS dividend ETFs I should be considering.

1ng6f4z,2025-09-13,2025-09-13 15:26:45,Living off dividends was my dream… but as a Polish investor I just discovered the 40% U.S. estate pay trap,"Hey everyone,

For years my dream was simple: to save enough so that I could live off dividends. I finally reached that point – I’ve been investing through Tastytrade into U.S. ETFs (mainly SCHD and some VGT), and I’ve built up a serious portfolio.

I’m 27, married, with a little daughter. I always imagined dividends as the foundation of financial security for my family – stability during my life, and something I could eventually pass down.

I also considered real estate, but honestly? It’s not as attractive anymore. ROI is low, demographics in Poland are bad, and I don’t believe property prices will keep growing like they did in the past. That’s why I went all-in on stocks and dividends.

And then I discovered the U.S. estate tax rules. Here’s the painful part:

* As a non-U.S. resident, if I hold more than **$60,000 in U.S. assets (stocks/ETFs)**, my heirs could face up to **40% estate tax** when I die.
* It doesn’t matter that I live in Poland and already pay taxes here – the U.S. only cares that the securities are listed in America, so they treat them as “U.S. assets” and apply estate tax.
* With my current portfolio, I already fall into the **highest bracket: 40% estate tax**.
* And Poland has **no estate tax treaty with the U.S.**, so I’m fully exposed.

This hit me very hard. My biggest fear is that if something happens to me, my wife and daughter won’t just lose me – they could also lose almost half of what I’ve been building for years. It feels like they’d be robbed of the very security I wanted to leave them.

People often suggest UCITS ETFs in Europe as an alternative. But let me be blunt: **UCITS ETFs are terrible compared to the U.S. ones – much more expensive, worse in performance, and with far fewer choices.** For someone who spent years building a strategy around SCHD and similar funds, switching to UCITS feels like a huge downgrade.

I know there are ways around this (family foundations, trusts, private banking), but honestly? It hurts that my dream of living off dividends turned out to be so complicated.

👉 I’d especially like to hear from people who have actually dealt with this issue in real life – how did you solve it? Did you set up a trust, a foundation, or just accept the risk? I don't know.. maybe I should just sell everything and transfer money to European broker and buy nasdaq etf and wait, or maybe buy some real estate. Ehh.

If I buy 50k of ULTY, the yield rate is 134%. This means that I will be making 67k per year only in dividends. Now I consider the HIGHEST possible tax bracket which is 37%. 67,000 x 0.37 = $24,790



So, I will be getting ($67,000 - $24,790) = $42,210 in dividends per year, AFTER taxes.



Let's suppose 4 years from now, ULTY goes to zero and stops paying the dividends. I would have accumulated $42,210 x 4 = $168,840



If the ULTY dividends go to zero, become shit, become unsellable, I will still have a net profit of $168,840 - $50,000 = $118,840



That is a HUGE improvement. So what am I missing? And with the dividends I'm getting paid from ULTY, I would buy less risky stuff like QQQI, SPY, and BTC.",0,17,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nffbb4/a_possible_scenario_when_buying_ulty/,new,Brokerage,0.48

But please accept the premise and consider an answer. I.e. this is not asking whether there is a real estate bubble, and nor is it about to burst; it's about understanding REIT risk).

REITs pay very nice dividends/distributions, largely as required by law (some percentage of revenue has to be paid out in order to be a REIT with all of those benefits). When interest rates decline, dividend/income paying stocks should increase in value. 

But what if in addition to interest rates declining (and the reason for the decline), the real estate bubble bursts because of overpriced real estate, or a deep recession, business failures and defaults (commercial real estate), homeowners default because of unemployment, homeowners default because they really couldn't afford their mortgage in the first place (a la 2008), etc.

I am seeing may posts about making significant amount of money from dividends. As I understand dividend (qualified or not) is income. Being an income, even if you have reinvested it, won't you have pay income tax on it? Federal and may be state income tax. If you are in higher tax bracket, you may have to pay a significant amount as taxes. And this will repeat every year. Is my understanding correct? If so, won't it be better to invest in growth stocks and let that grow tax free till you sell it during your retirement when you may be on lower tax bracket?

Background: 33M in MCOL city. I have a wife and a 5 and 2 year old. Wife makes 80K a year in a steady corporate job. Has about 60k in a 401K

I’ve been in the same Real Estate job for the last ten years and am reaching my breaking point. Very stressful and my boss (owner of the company) just simply isn’t a good person.  

I have about 120K in mutual funds but no 401K since my company is a small family run business. I’m about to quit my job and go get my Broker’s license and go out on my own in Real Estate. 

My wife is receiving a 400K inheritance at the end of this month. Income is our primary focus currently while I start my Brokerage. We need income to pay the bills until I get the Brokerage up and running. 

We own two single family homes that we rent out. One is paid in full and the other has a 140K mortgage on it and is worth about 205K. Both are rented with good long-term tenants. After all expenses (taxes, insurance, the mortgage on the one, etc) we cash-flow about 1,300 a month combined. But of course we’ve had some unexpected expensive Cap-Ex hit us recently so this can’t be relied upon. 

We sold another rental about 4 months ago and turned it into 100K in SPYI, 100K in QQQI, 10K in MSTY, and 10K in ULTY. That alone brings in about $3,600 a month at a 25% yield.

I know a 25% yield isn’t sustainable and want to bring it down closer to 10-12%. I’m okay with a little risk and not capitalizing on growth as income is currently our focus. 

We will have about 380K after taxes to invest and am considering the follow allocation: 

Realty Income (O): 100K (Feel strongly upcoming tax cuts while really help them)
AMLP: 50K
PBDC: 50K
UTG: 50K
JBB: 25K
GPIQ: 25K
GPIX: 25K
QDVO: 15K
IDVO: 15K
ARCC: 15K
EPD: 10K

Am I missing anything here? Any blind spots or sectors that I need to include to feel diversified? Appreciate your input!

I hear a lot of ""Dividends don't matter"" and ""You are excluding a large part of the market...blah, blah.

What I do know is that given my portfolio I'm able to utilize dividends to not only sustain my lifestyle but also Dollar Cost Average.  So when the market tanks, and it will tank,  my portfolio will drop less than the market and to be honest I hope it drops as I'll be picking up shares on the cheap and adding to my dividend payments which will increase my take home pay and my dollar cost averaging even further.  So the reduced drawdown percentage in a downturn coupled with the Dollar Cost Averaging makes way more sense to me than just about any other approach.

1neajyj,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 10:37:34,BITO Chat GBT vs GROK,"
I see that these 2 AI models have different views about what happens to BITO dividend if bitcoin doubles in price. Chat gbt originally claimed that even though BITO price could double the dividend dollar amount would be the same (so the percentage yield would drop to say 25%). GROK disagreed and expected the dividend amount to increase substantially even by 100%. So I put GROK into Chat GBT to see what it had to say to defend itself with the result below. My takeaway is if you believe the rosy scenarios painted for bitcoin it’s better to stock up now to capture the maximum $ dividend amounts rather than buying progressively as the prices rise. 


⸻

✅ Interpretation
	•	Now: With BITO at ~$20 and annual dividends around $10.60, the yield looks huge (~53%).
	•	Future A (Favorable): If Bitcoin doubles and BITO’s dividends scale proportionally, both price and payout double → yield stays the same (~53%).
	•	Future B (Less favorable): If roll costs or falling interest rates cap dividend growth, the payout rises only ~25% → yield drops (~33%).

So the key takeaway:
	•	If Grok’s view holds (Scenario A), your per-share dividend does double with Bitcoin.
	•	If my more cautious view (Scenario B) holds, distributions increase but more slowly, and yield % falls.

👉 Would you like me to extend this with a sensitivity table (showing multiple Bitcoin price increases, not just a doubling) so you can see how dividends might behave across a range of outcomes?",0,4,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1neajyj/bito_chat_gbt_vs_grok/,new,Discussion,0.4

They are fundamentally not dividends.  They are options premiums that are paid out.  The same way bond yields are not dividends.

Sure these each provide income, but they all have entirely different return sources and risk profiles.

My point is nothing against these products, the discussion just has no place here, and muddies the waters.

P. S. 
I do have something against these products and the people who invest in them.  They offer high “guaranteed” returns on paper which lure people in, while eating into NAV where a percentage of distributions are usually just returning your own money to you.  They slowly eat themselves into inexistence while taking fees.  Then because they are short volatility, they blow up at the worst time possible.

1ndsj8j,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 18:41:03,How Northwest Healthcare's Dividend Slash Is Hitting Retail Investors Hard,"Hey r/dividends,

The recent dividend cut by Northwest Healthcare Properties REIT (NWH.UN) from $0.06667 to $0.03 per unit monthly has sent shockwaves through the investor community, especially for those relying on its income stream. With a hefty $3.65 billion debt load and rising interest rates squeezing their finances, NWH's move to slash dividends has left many retail investors frustrated and rethinking their positions.

From what I've seen on Reddit and other forums, the sentiment is pretty sour—some are disappointed about losing reliable passive income, while others are questioning the REIT's long-term stability, especially after its stock has tanked nearly 50% over the past decade. The sale of their UK portfolio and other assets raises more questions about future cash flow and whether the dividend will ever recover.

For those holding NWH.UN or eyeing healthcare REITs, what’s your take? Are you sticking it out, or is this a sign to pivot to other income-focused investments? How are you navigating REITs in this high-interest-rate environment?

Can’t you buy let’s say 50k worth of ULTY and, instead of reinvesting the dividends in ULTY, use those dividends to buy different stocks? Wouldn’t that situation be advantageous? And when ULTY is about to go down, you resell it? 



Can’t you just hold on the ULTY shares for a couple of years, until you get money to buy other stabler stocks, and then resell them? 



There’s a piece I’m missing because I’m reading and studying and I’m completely ignorant on the dividends topics, but what is the worst that can happen with ULTY if you use their dividends to buy other stocks and you resell the ULTY holdings when they are about to go down?

I'm 38 years old and have generally constructed my portfolios with a focus on growth.  However, I love the concept of dividends and recently have been putting money in QQQI specifically.  I gave thought to selling that position today and putting the money in some combination of QQQM and VOO (already hold both, VOO position being twice as heavy).  I then considered the option of maintaining my QQQI position, turning off DRIP, and investing those dividends into some combination of QQQM/VOO.  My thought process there is that QQQI under-performs both QQQM and VOO but not by a ton.  Maintaining QQQI would provide some growth AND 'free money' that I would put into more traditional growth funds.  Would love this group's thoughts on those two possible plans.

1ndl3kk,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 13:45:05,Dividend income and total return are NOT always interchangeable,"I keep trying to have a useful discussion about dividend income during retirement, and every time, across multiple subs, it’s derailed by people saying to ignore dividends and focus on total return, because they’re effectively the same. This has even happened on this sub, where I wrongly assumed people would see through such a misunderstanding.

Either these people are wrong, or I’m misunderstanding something very fundamental. So, let’s have it out. I’ll make my argument, and people can tell me where I’m wrong, and I’ll either walk away having learned my lesson, or finally conclude that most people are just confused on this issue.

First, I want to acknowledge where I think people who make this argument are coming from and agree that they have a point in certain scenarios.

Let’s say I have two stocks, KO and Example Corp. (EXAM). KO pays a reliable dividend and EXAM doesn’t pay a dividend. Assume I’m in a tax-advantaged account, and nearing retirement but not actually in it, so we’ll ignore the tax implications for now. If EXAM and KO (including DRIP) both gain 25% in one year, it’s true that in many ways the dividend doesn’t matter. I’m still 25% richer from either one, and I can sell either stock just as easily. As I understand it, this is the point people are making when they say total return and dividends are interchangeable, so just focus on total return. In this scenario, I agree that they are interchangeable.

However, there are many scenarios where dividend income and total return have extremely different properties, and this matters a lot, and *that is the entire point of dividends*.

A personal finance example illustrates the point. Imagine you got hired for a job, and they agreed to pay you $100,000 a year. You eagerly await your first paycheck, and it never arrives. You complain to HR, and they explain, “Oh, at this company, we don’t pay in a consistent, predictable way like other companies. We pay you in random amounts at unexpected intervals. Some days you may receive a check for $4.63, some days you get a check for $7080.21, and some days you get nothing. But, we promise, by the end of the year, you’ll receive a total of $100,000.”

Very few people would continue working at such a place, because *consistency and predictability of cash flow is extremely important*. Many people couldn’t pay their bills that situation.

When you retire, your portfolio becomes your paycheck, so the cash flow you draw from it matters. Yes, there are many strategies for making the income smooth and predictable, and dividend payments are only one strategy. However, dividends, at least from reliable companies, have a different risk profile than other strategies, and this gives them different advantages and disadvantages.

Among highly reliable companies (say, the Dividend Aristocrats or Dividend Kings), the following is true:

1. It has never happened that half the companies in these lists suddenly quit paying dividends. Some do quit paying dividends, but it’s on the order of 1-2% on any given year.
2. It has never happened that the majority of the companies in these lists reduce their dividends dramatically in a short period of time. In fact, all of them have increased their dividends for 25 years straight, including through the 2008 recession.
3. Even if the market value of the companies gets cut in half, you still get your full dividends.
4. Over the long term, both the dividend payouts and the market value of the companies tends to grow at a rate that exceeds inflation. Therefore, if you never sell any shares, it is extremely unlikely your portfolio value will ever fall to $0.

In other words, the risk that my dividend income will go away or dramatically shrink is very low. This has been true over many decades and though many recessions.

In contrast, the following is true of the stock market in general:

1. It may dramatically (25-50%) drop in value at any time and take years to recover.
2. You may have to sell stocks while the market is down, compounding your losses.
3. If you miscalculate your safe withdrawal rate (SWR), perhaps because of a bad market early on in your retirement, you may go broke before you die.

I understand that there are ways to mitigate risk on the total return side (e.g., mixing in bonds). I agree that they are pretty good and I plan to also use them during retirement. However, they have a different risk profile. I work in risk management, and have a master’s in the subject, and different risk profiles matter, a lot.

Put simply, with dividend paying companies, your primary risk is mismanagement by leadership. With total return, your primary risk is market timing. These are not the same.

While dividend income can always be treated as total returns, total returns cannot always be treated as income without potentially locking in big losses. In other words, the interchangeability only reliably goes one way.

Large companies understand this, and that’s why they pay dividends despite the tax disadvantages. Institutional investors understand this, and that’s why they demand dividends despite the tax disadvantages. Every investor should understand this, so they can make an informed decision about which risks they are most comfortable taking.

Ok fair warning this post might be a little long but that’s only because I’m telling you my current situation and I’ll do my best to keep it in order. So I’m 33 years old, I work part time for a physical therapy office as an aide. I also go to school part time finishing my associates degree in liberal arts but plan on going into the radiology technologist program after i graduate. The program itself is full time only 8am-4pm and 2 years long. Meaning while I’m in the program I can’t really work while in the program other than working the 5 hour Saturday shift my job has. 

 I have a savings account that I don’t have access to until my mom passes on that has $40k in it. This is my emergency savings account that I got when I was a minor thinking that I’d have access to the money when I came of age turns out that’s not the case. So that’s in the background for later on in life.

Now onto the money. I’ve been working at my job for 6 years, I have a 403b plan with employer matching, as of last year I started putting the money in the Roth 403b (same account just now it’s being taxed). I also switched it over a little over a month ago from the target date fund, to the s&p500 fund for better gains but sadly my 403b doesn’t earn any dividends. I have 10% being taken out per check going to this. In total my 403b is worth $44,014 as of the time of this post. 

Last year I opened up my Roth IRA in mid July 2024, and started putting $120/ check into it. I have my Roth with vanguard. My primary focus, given that Vanguard doesn’t offer fractional shares other than with Vanguard products, is that I would put as much of the $120 into SCHD that I could buy and then any money that’s leftover I put into VOO. Currently I have been able to consistently buy 4 shares of SCHD and about 0.01/0.02 shares of VOO. I have just recently sporadically been buying shares of SCHG here and there. Currently I have:

SCHD shares 156.424 ($4,292.27)
VOO shares 2.422 ($1,444.72)
SCHG shares 20.004 ($619.92)

For a total of $6,357.32

My goal is to buy and hold forever and live off of the dividends, hense SCHD being my primary focus. But this is my dilemma, lately I’ve been reading peoples posts on here about focusing on growth and then transfer to dividends later. My position in SCHD has finally gotten to the point where the quarterly dividends are large enough that it can buy 1 full share of the ETF when I get them. I don’t know if I should continue to invest primarily in SCHD as my focus since once i eventually get into the radiology program (which should hopefully be next year) I won’t be working as much and if I should focus on getting those dividends as large as possible to carry the weight for when I have to stop contributing for 2 years. Or should I switch over to SCHG as my focus and have the leftovers go into VOO since I’ll be missing out on growth and I can switch it over to SCHD later on in life? My ideal goal would be to life off of $100,000 in annual dividends, but I know I’d need like $2.5M in SCHD to get even close to that. 

So I’m hoping that by the time I retire, with the money in my 403b, the savings account I don’t have access to yet, social security, and my Roth IRA that all of that combined will be enough that I can retire comfortably even if it’s not $100,000 in annual dividends. 

What are your guys thoughts on my current situation? What would you do if you were put in my situation? Should I continue DCA in SCHD with leftovers into VOO or should I switch my focus to SCHG? Also keep in mind that once i eventually become a radiology technologist I’ll be making more money and I can afford to contribute more later on, hopefully enough to make up for the 2 year gap that I missed out on.

What are some investments that I could add that are not strongly correlated to what I already have ? I was thinking about gold but that doesn’t pay a dividend (unless using a CC fund). Also considering CEFS (the etf) and FSCO ? Or other safer ways to invest in credit? I would love to hear some feedback.

1ncmd84,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 11:41:59,Correct my train of thought - using qqqi to park cash instead of a 4% money market for higher yield,"Background - all set on other investments, no debt, etc etc.

Have $70k sitting in a cash account making 4%.  This isn't earmarked for emergency or retirement. Maybe something in the middle - if I casually come across a piece of property or want a shiny new toy

Came across qqqi and thought it might be a good alternative.  The idea is that the principal could still be liquidated for a larger purchase, but in the meantime have it cashflow a few more bucks to enjoy guilt free hobbies/weekend getaways.

I 100% get the price of qqqi falling so I'd be exposed to that - but rationally I just wouldn't sell at that time ( maybe buy more?)

My napkin math says it should pay 3x what I'm making on the cash account after taxes and fees.

So first - is the math correct?

Am I correct in saying if I paid $53/share and a year later I sell at $53 a share - thats a wash ( no tax implications) and really no different that pulling out my principal, just like I would on the money market account?

Am I missing anything ( like is the tax situation better or worse than what I'm thinking?

Better alternatives?

napkin math on $70k

|Investment|Gross Monthly|After-Tax Monthly (est.)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Money Market (4%)|$233|**$177**|
|QQQI ETF (\~14% yield)|$817|**$590**|

Edit : Re-highlighting this cash isn't set aside for emergencies - I have a separate account with 2 years expenses already filled for that.  I guess if there was an emergency with a greater need, I'd probably be tapping in to more buckets than just this one.

  
Edit 2: Decided on putting $25k in to QQI - figured that can get me close to the current dividends of the entire $70k the money market ( about $200 /month) , and will look in to some of the other suggestions to place the remaining $45k :-) I agree with spreading it out a bit or even holding it in cash longer for a deal to come up.

1ncljm0,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 11:10:38,JEPI vs GPIX maybe SPYI,"I’ve been following this thread for a while, and the more I learn, the more I realize how much I don’t know.

First: I’ve noticed a big divide when it comes to MSTY. Some people point out the steady NAV decline, while others don’t seem to care as long as their dividend income outweighs their initial cash outlay.

Second: A lot of people here seem to like JEPI. I was considering it for a portfolio I’m building, but when I looked at the NAV chart, it honestly left me a little discouraged.

Third: I recently came across GPIX. It looks like it has a lower expense ratio and a different mix of assets compared to JEPI. It seems like GPIX is at least trying to preserve NAV, though maybe it’s not as defensive. SPYI might be another option too.

What do you all think? 
Maybe if you’re in this position, share your portfolio design? This person has income from residential real estate, so I wasn’t planning any REITs.  These investments would be in an IRA for a 72yr old facing RMDs soon. He doesn’t really need the income (gets nervous if net worth declines), but I was hoping the RMDs would encourage him to start living a more plentiful life. I.e. a new truck, a vacation, or maybe even a steak that’s not from the expired section of the cooler!



EDIT: this is the portfolio design I was thinking. 
15% SCHD or VTV
10% EXG
20% JEPI or SPYI
5% VPU  or XLU
15% PFF or FPE
15% BND or AGG
10% SCHP
5% XLE or DBC
5% SHV or SWVXX

This hasn’t been a very loved named, and has historically traded at a discount to the HPC peers. It’s a target of a few activist fights, and management is relatively green. Back to this newer news, doesn’t a ~15% move downward seem like a lot for a brand that makes up only about 10% of revenue. And that’s for the entire population that regularly uses it, not just pregnant women. 

It doesn’t help that the science is shoddy and apparently there is no consensus among the scientific community that acetaminophen taken during pregnancy has any impact on pregnancy. Even if it does have grounding, what kind of liability would this even present?

I feel like it’s de-risked enough to be worth a lick at these levels. A lot of research reports have been published reiterating buys, with maybe slight downside to price target. It’s a leading HPC with $36B in cap, $15B in revenue, and they essentially have a top brand in every category they’re in (skincare, mouthwash, bandage, nicotine patch).

To preface, I have a portfolio with about 30 stocks in it. Most are stable div stocks, some are volatile growth, and a few are terrible no good YM stocks. Today I would like to talk about those few...

I have around 10k sitting in this account. Around 2k sits in YM stocks. From that, about $600ish is in ulty.

We've been around for a while, we have seen that ulty drops constantly, however I am a dog and I want the weekly(incredibly volatile) div. My only problem is the constant loss. I don't mind a loss, but I feel like there is a better way to manage it. That brings me to my next part.

Why not just buy some shares before the ex div date, drip the div, and sell afterwards, holding whatever amount of shares afterwards. My very own modification of the dividend capture strategy. That way I can miss out on some of the weekly decline.

I understand that dividend capture is quite risky so I want to find other strategies or experienced opinions before I try it.

I want people to tell me it's bad, or good(not). But I also want to hear you opinion on WHY its bad or good. I also want to know what I should be doing instead.

Post note: Yes I fully understand that YM etfs are not sustainable. No, I don't plan on keeping them long term.

1nbbgbj,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 22:02:13,Pay Yourself in STOCKS instead of JUST a Paycheck!,"I came up with this awesome way to get me motivated to go into work and to invest! 

  
Each day I go into work I track my days and then I invest one share of a dividend income stock.  Right now it costs about 27 bucks for the share, it pays quarterly, however  I track it via monthly income so 8.5 cents it pays.  So for 5 days I build 42.5 cents of income that is monthly going to come back to me every single month in the future! 

  
Also I go to the gym 4 days a week typically.  So long as  go each visit I allow myself 1/2 share of stock as well so that is another 2 shares of stock so another 17 cents. So that is 59.5 cents each week I am building in endless income! 

  
52x59.5 thats 3,094 pennies or 30.94 x 10 years thats 309.4 or 618.8 for 20 years! 

  
Yes, im turning 40 this year and had I been doing this I would have been making... lets say 600 bucks ( accounting for days  I didn't work or what)  by now doing that alone!!!! I wish I understood this when I was 20 years old just starting! If you are in your 20's consider somthing like this that motivates you to keep going and building your wealth.  

  
I mean 600 bucks isn't tons to retire on but if I was in between jobs  and had 600 monthly income going 2 months without work wouldn't be a sweat at all provided I still have a nest egg of an emergency fund but yea.. 

I am also planning buying another stock one per day that costs around 5 buck but pays out 4 cents in monthly income.  If I don't buy anything for lunch and instead pack a lunch which is cheaper than buying stuff at work then I can buy another ONE share per week.  so that would help me stay motivated to eat cheaper lunches and invest another 20 cents  a week as well. 

I still do invest all my left over monthly cash into stocks to build that divd income but for those two stocks I am not going to invest in and the only way I can get more is by ""earning them"" from these rules. 

  
May seem unnessary but it is a great way to motivate me and keep me on track at work, gym, and on lunch!  Thought it be good to share as it might help others become motivated as well and change it as they like...

  
Happy investing everyone.  I just wish I beeen doing this all along! ugh.. We really need to be telling people JUST starting out how to REALLY build wealth like this and with such simple easy steps it can be life changing I mean if I was doing this at age 20 I would have stayed on track with my diet, health and work balance and mindset so much better.. but hey, at least im starting now.

1nb2uw9,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 15:47:11,Good references for Dividend Investing.,"I think I understand dividend investing, both for income and for dividend appreciation, but maybe not. E.g. some people advise APPL with a 0.43% dividend yield for dividend appreciation (I think it has 14 years of increasing dividend). But as an investor interested in dividends, I wouldn't buy APPL now for dividend appreciation; nice adder but not the specific factor for me to buy it now. FDVV has NVDA as its top holding (with 0.02% yield) as well as sub 1% yields for 4 of its top 5 holdings - juicing or specifically good dividend picks? (and yes, I understand div reinvestment keeps accumulating more shares, more dividends). 

As one commenter said on one of my posts: ""I suggest spending some time to understand what dividend investing really means. Buying some dividend investments doesn't automatically make you a dividend investor."" 

So, I would appreciate some references? What's the one book, the bible, for dividend investing that's relevant today?

The same could be said for several other covered call ETFs that pay extraordinarily high div rates, such as MSTY. If you are looking at taking a crazy 50% or higher dividend in cash and *also* expecting the NAV to keep up with the underlying or stay flat - you need to consider reinvesting the div or just avoid these types of ETFs altogether. I personally don't own ULTY so I don't have a dog in the fight. Just check out the performance with and without div reinvestment compared to the SP500 with div reinvestment below.

1nasxhg,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 09:16:37,Dividend Portfolio 2025 – Should I stay with income focus or switch to growth?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve recently started building a dividend-focused portfolio and I’d love to get some feedback.

# My Goals

* Preserve and grow capital (I don’t want erosion)
* Generate consistent monthly income (like a “salary”)
* Reinvest all dividends until mid-2026
* Long-term wealth growth, but I’m not sure if my allocation is right

Current portfolio (about 21K ):

* SCHD – 162.99 shares (\~$4,505)
* JEPI – 74.63 shares (\~$4,237)
* JEPQ – 20.26 shares (\~$1,130)
* SPYI – 42.88 shares (\~$2,214)
* QQQI – 44.36 shares (\~$2,359)
* IYRI – 35.37 shares (\~$1,799)
* O – 28.21 shares (\~$1,666)
* STAG – 41.93 shares (\~$1,551)
* LTC – 43.50 shares (\~$1,593)

💵 Current dividends: about **$110-130/month**  
💵 Plan: I’m adding **$6K per month until May 2026** (around $54K more).

# My Dilemma

* Should I keep this income-heavy allocation?
* Or move towards more **growth exposure (maybe 60% covered call, 40% growth)?**
   * For growth I’m considering **Microsoft, Google, Meta**.
* My worry: am I **missing the train** if I stay too dividend-focused?
* Is it smarter to just go full growth now and switch to dividends later?

I’m still learning and don’t feel I have enough knowledge yet, so your thoughts would mean a lot 🙏

Thanks in advance!

1nasiyw,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 08:57:53,Low Volatility Distribution Sample,"I’ve seen alot of posts about chasing 15% distributions while avoiding too much instability. 

As a result, I’d like to share my sample portfolio. 

1. No Nasdaq related funds. It’s great for returns but the goal is minimal volatility. No bitcoin either. 

2. derivatives funds only being used. Obviously this alone makes it risky, but this is a narrow concept sample. I’d personally never have this portfolio as I love traditional ETFs too much 



A. DIVO - 25%

- this is the safest derivative ETF with the best all time charts. Consistent growth. Consistent distributions. It has gone through many many years of market movements. 

It has a fantastic selection criteria for its underlying stocks. And their precise and particular options writing focuses on best opportunities at the present and not a blanket approach. 

B. JEPI - 20%

- The largest AUM of all derivatives ETFs. JEPI has a strict selection of low volatility strong financials, usually holding around 100-120 underlying stocks. The downside is the growth on recoveries can be tough, but as shown during COVID, it weathers downturns amazingly. 

I love this once again due to the underlying selection process. Strong financials, blue chips. 

C. GPIX - 15%

- Holds the SP500 giving broader market exposure. Helps diversify your overall holdings. However this fund purposely tries to leave room for growth and not chase high distributions. This makes it excellent for long term holding into old age because of the growth it gives room for. 

I think this fund is fantastic. It delivers between 8-9% but still has every chart green. Sleeper etf. Should be bigger than it is. 

D. IDVO - 15%

- see DIVO above. Shorter history but similar fundamentals while holding international underlying strong stocks. Helps to further diversify. 

E. SPYI - 12.5%

- see GPIX, but focuses more on distribution total versus growth. This one is not going to give you much NAV at all. Its focus is on pay outs. As we are all hoping for income, this helps to amplify our total in the short term. It’s my dopamine hit. 

F. WTPI - 12.5%

- Cash Collateral and Puts on SPY (SP500). This one holds US treasury bills while doing short puts on SPY. 

This is actually one of my favorite investment products overall. Super low volatility with strong distribution percentages. It’s up 32% since 2017, so it has growth, even if minimal, NAV growth is so important for financial freedom. 


——

There you have it. This is my version of “safe” (it’s not that safe. Covered calls are inherently riskier than traditional dividend paying ETFs). 

I have purposely left JEPQ, GPIQ, and QQQI out (I hold these in my actual portfolio but they’re riskier and tied more volatility). 

Feel free to comment, leave criticism, ignore completely or roll your eyes. 

If there are any other safe derivative ETFs please feel free to share. 

Note that I thing green NAV is the most important part of these. So if you show me something that has great distributions but -25% in its lifetime, I will roll my eyes at you.

I have find these companies that have worldwide presence: mcd, nke, sbux, ko, pep, pg, cl, mkc, jnj, abt, abbv, mdt, novob, novn, azn, rog, msft, aapl, v, ma, orcl, blk, acn, cat, etn, emr, cvx, xom, adm, de, nesn, una, or, sie, sap, muv2, tte, hen, dge, bn(danone), txn.

For a short-term horizon (about 15 weeks until Christmas), what would be the smartest split between the two? Should I go 50/50, lean heavier on TSYY since it has better liquidity and higher yield or just stick the one, or spread it over more granite and round hill shares.

Would it make sense to take that and draw upon it to my max tax bracket, i.e., 22%. I would deposit the proceeds into my taxable account and purchase SPYI. I estimate it would take me up to 5 years to fully draw the lump sum out of my pension plan at the 22% tax bracket.

The monthly dividend income from SPYI is obviously more than what the Pension Plan would pay out. I'm still quite some ways out of retirement, so I am able to see SPYI performance going forward for a couple of years before pulling the trigger.

I could do Roth conversions instead, but it means waiting for five years in order to receive monthly benefits... So, I think it's not an option.

Or is that too risky? Should stick to the Pension Plan monthly payments instead? They're bond-like, almost guaranteed, and SPYI is not.",4,34,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nafbgz/convert_pension_plan_lump_sum_to_spyi/,new,Discussion,0.7

And now that it’s September and we r getting into autumn and winter it’s time to hit the gym and bulk up with some good protein. I’m thinking of getting some HRL at the current $25 level. Here’s the elevator pitch……
1.) it’s a dividend king (50+ years of increasing dividends, it has paid an uninterrupted dividend since 1928)
2.) 4.5% dividend yield that is securely covered by earnings and FCF that should continue to grow annually
3.) SPAM has a large established global presence is growing in several key Asian countries. 
4.) Last quarters results I believe was a “kitchen sink” quarter given by the former and current interim CEO. They will put in modest price increases (that I think they can pass thru to consumers) to protect margins. Thus, I believe earnings will be better than the companies guide. 
5.) As mentioned earlier…. Cutting season is over because pool/beach season is over. It’s time to lift weight and get swole brah. So lift heavy and feed those working muscles with delicious applegate meats, hormel Mac and cheese, hormel meats, planters peanuts, Spam and others!
6.) So in conclusion…buy HRL at $25 and less. Collect rising dividends, use dividends to buy hormel proteins, lift weights, eat hormel proteins which makes muscles grow and repeat until desired bulk. BOOM that’s some DD!!!

Ohh and I don’t know if I have to say this legally but disclaimer: I am an investing enthusiast but I am not a financial nor investing professional. Do ur own DD.

I’m looking for some help on how to allocate my 401k. Right now, everything is sitting in **American Funds 2060 Target Date Fund (R6)**, but I want to make sure I’m not just defaulting to that without considering other options.

Here are the funds available to me:

**Bonds**

* Prudential Stable Value Fund
* JPMorgan Core Plus Bond R6
* PIMCO Income Instl
* Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Adm

**Large-Cap Stocks**

* ClearBridge Large Cap Value I
* Vanguard Institutional Index I
* AB US Large Cap Growth L

**Mid/Small-Cap Stocks**

* Wilmington Trust MFS Mid Cap Value Class 2W
* Principal Mid Cap Equity Tier IV
* Vanguard Mid Cap Index I
* Wilmington Trust Franklin Small Cap Value Class R
* Fidelity Small Cap Index
* Invesco Discovery R6
* Cohen & Steers Real Estate Securities Z

**International Stocks**

* Fidelity International Index
* MFS International Diversification R6
* Vanguard International Value Inv

**Other / Balanced / Target Date**

* Janus Henderson Balanced T
* American Funds Target Date series (2010–2065)

**Current balance:** $3,763 (100% in American Funds 2060 R6)

**About me:**

* Age: 30
* Time horizon: I plan to retire around 2060–2065, so I’ve got a long runway.

**Question:**  
Given the fund lineup, should I just stay in the 2060 Target Date fund, or would it make more sense to build my own allocation using the Vanguard Institutional Index (S&P 500), Fidelity Small Cap Index, Vanguard International Index, and maybe the Vanguard Bond Index?

Basically – would a DIY 3-fund or 4-fund portfolio be smarter here, or are the target date funds “good enough”?

Why would I invest in SCHD vs just increasing VYM? (This is largely to help me understand fund and dividend investing. I'm looking at other dividend funds too) 

VYM appears to have done better than SCHD this year and over the last 10 years, and it was much better (much less bad) in 2022, although VYM was killed in 2008 (before schd I think). 

VYM is heavy into financials, which bothers me at the moment, but schd is heavy into energy which really bothers me at the moment (downturn/recession, geopolitical eg opec+, Russia potentially flooding market, US production, EU and others with renewables). I do like schd with a good position in consumer defensive. 

Looking at risk, I think VYM is better (less risky) and alpha is much better (but I don't yet have a good handle on some of the risk measures)

1mpzdzh,2025-08-14,2025-08-14 08:34:11,I hit over 8K dividends per year at 23y😃,"I have been investing in stocks for over 4 years and have learned from books by Peter Lynch, Charlie Munger, André Kostolany, and other investors. I have found that the dividend strategy suits me best.

I prefer to buy dividend kings and dividend aristocrats- companies that have always been strong in the market, have a solid presence, and deliver good financial results. I also diversify across sectors, but most of my investments are in consumer goods, finance, and healthcare, followed by industry, communications, and so on.

My portfolio currently has a dividend yield of just over 5%. On average, the companies in my portfolio increase their dividends by around 8% per year. Annual dividend growth is especially important to me, as it increases the compounding effect in my portfolio.

I reinvest almost all dividends, except in rare cases. By now, I am mostly accumulating, watching the market daily, and trying to pick up companies during drawdowns at an attractive dividend-to-price ratio (of course, only if they match my criteria).

I’m excited to share ideas with you.

1irqkpz,2025-02-17,2025-02-17 13:16:59,Warren Buffett received a $740 million dividend payment from Coca-Cola (KO),"I recently came across a tweet highlighting Warren Buffett’s $740 million dividend income from Coca-Cola (KO). This sparked my curiosity: **What if Buffett had invested the same amount in the S&P 500 (SPY) instead?**

So, I created a comparison table based on his KO investment and a hypothetical SPY investment. Since I couldn’t find the exact purchase dates, I used quarter-end dates for my calculations.

The results are eye-opening:

* **Even after including dividends, SPY ($67.01B) outperformed KO ($38.17B) by approximately 75.6%.**
* Despite KO’s impressive dividend stream, SPY delivered far stronger total returns, highlighting the power of broad-market index investing over time.

I found it fascinating to see how Buffett’s legendary investment compares with the index, especially considering his recent sale of all SPY and VOO holdings.

I feel completely defeated.,"I've been building my dividend portfolio for years, aiming to reach financial independence one day. Every deposit was a small step toward a dream: a peaceful life, funded by passive income, no stress, no 9-to-5.

I chose what I thought were the best: SCHD, DGRO JEPQ, QQQI — solid US-based ETFs with great yield and growth potential. I had a plan, I was sticking to it. Then… comes Section 899.

For those who don't know: it's a proposed US tax law that could increase the withholding tax on dividends to 15% or even 30% for investors from countries deemed to have ""discriminatory"" tax systems toward the US. And guess what? My country (Poland) is very likely to be on that blacklist.

If the tax treaty is terminated (which is already being discussed), it means 30% goes to the US, and then Poland may charge another 19%. That’s nearly half the dividend gone. Just like that.

It feels like everything I’ve worked toward is falling apart. Switching to European dividend ETFs? Sure, but they have lower quality, less growth, and are not the same in terms of long-term compounding. It feels like being forced to start over — with worse tools.

Honestly, I’m gutted. Years of planning, DCA, building my ideal long-term strategy… and then politics slams the door in my face. I feel defeated. I had such a great plan and I was already so close :/ I wanted to hold SCHD and DGRO for decades and eventually pass them on to my kids.

1jxqcdg,2025-04-12,2025-04-12 16:16:26,Finally reached 1M!! 4k/m income (Update On The Story - Questions Answered),"Many of you have seen the [post from a week ago ](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1jpybyr/finally_reached_1m_4km_income_my_story/)where I said that I reached 1M from compound interest (4k a month now). I will do a follow up, answering most asked questions, because I couldn’t answer them all, nor edit the post to do so there at the time, so I’m making a new post now.

  
I will list most questions asked in random order.

  
**Can you share the portfolio? Sure, why not. Its in the** **attached images**

  
**How old are you and how long were you investing**

I’m almost 40 and i started at 20 but at the time I never took it seriously and just putting in like 20-50$ a month. I “seriously” started at around 23-24 when I was putting in approx, 300$ on average (that was a huge for me back then), and now averaging at around 2-2.5k per month. I’ve had a few good months in the meantime which allowed me to put more in the portfolio.

  
**How much you spend so you are able to invest that amount**

  
Not much at all. Never been a big spender. Approx 350€ a month myself (i share expenses with my significant other), with a total cost of 700€ a month (on average per month through the year). I live in a europe in a country where cost of living is not that high.

Other than that we have two old cars (20 and 15 years) - included in above expenses. We don’t wear fancy clothes or spend money on impressing others (this can cost you a fortune).

  
**Are you afraid of current market state (Tarrifs, Trump, potential recession)**

Yes and no. It’s hard to see portfolio plummeting, but i then remember myself I’m playing a long game. I’m not in a hurry, administration will change, markets will become green eventually. They did in the past, every single time. But again watching the portfolio now is not a pleasant feeling.

  
**What apps / tools are you using**

  
This one does not have unified answer. I started with simple excel (i’m still using it tho when i export the data from the app i use), I changed many sites in the past 20 years, then after apps and portfolio trackers became popular I’ve started using them too. 

I started with with an app that I don’t remember right now, then Stock Events app , then in mid 2023 migrated to the Inveester - https://inveester.com. And that’s because it gives everything I need and it has the cheapest sub model (my mindset is that any money that is not spent is re-invested). In the end I never settle and always looking for good alternatives.  

  
**Do you coach, .. suggest what to buy,.. etc**

No. And that’s because I’m not an expert in general sense. The money that is there mostly came from initial investment + observation.. and then repeating the cycle and then time made everything work together with compound interest. 

  
My suggestion is that you start as early as you can, but never is too late.

My Roth IRA is roughly: 25% QQQ, 25% VTI, 25% VIG, 22% SCHD, less than 2% MSFT & DGRO

My Roth 457b is roughly: 53% SV-COM (state street S&P 500), 22% V0128A (MFS International blend), 8% DFFVX, 6% LMOIX, 4% ANCFX, 3% VERIX, 1% BAGSX, BGRFX, NVLIX, and PORT (empower guaranteed portfolio)

I’ve self invested my Roth IRA, and my Roth 456b is robo invested through empower. The 457b is purely growth, they don’t offer any dividend plays. My IRA I’m balancing both growth (QQQ) and dividends (the rest). I had been running a 25/25/25/25 with QQQ, VTI, VIG, and SCHD for awhile. I bought MSFT with Schwab slices to make sure I was as close to 100% invested as I could be (you can’t buy dividends on stock slices). Lately I’ve been slightly less pleased with how SCHD has been performing and have begun adding DGRO. 

In the last 5 years I’ve also been able to buy a home, travel, eat out, etc. I’ve done all of this while pulling in roughly $100k a year. 

My plan is to retire at 60 and turn my IRA into a full dividend account and never touch the nest egg as I draw down my 457b and collect my pension. My pension is small, but I don’t have to fund it at all. It should be roughly mid $30k a year based on what I make now. 

I see a ton of people posting on here with million dollar accounts and for regular people I think it’s hard to relate. I wanted to show even working class people who are consistent can live good, and make investment gains. They say your first $100k takes the longest, here’s hoping to get another $100k in less than 5.

Today we own the same two: 19,739 shares of FCO and 6,015 shares of PDI. This month we collected $1,381.78 from FCO and $1,326.31 from PDI (both are paid monthly).  Today total value is approx. $234k.   We also own 1,818 shares of TQQQ valued today at $130k (+81.8% ytd). I am using TQQQ for capital gains and the others for living.  I reinvest a portion of my dividends each month.

I understand my situation is different and there is a lot to be said about closed end funds and what is right and what is not. This setup has worked for me and may not work for you.

1mp5le3,2025-08-13,2025-08-13 10:12:20,"Just $1,000/year in dividends.","After 4 years of investing on/off I hit my latest goal of $1,000 annual dividends this morning; a modest achievement compared to others, but it’s been very rewarding seeing my portfolio grow and I’m proud of my efforts in adding a lot disposable income to my investments. My yield is pretty low as I’m prioritizing growth — 401k streams directly into the S&P, for example — but lately I’ve been adding some more dividend players because it’s been fun seeing the annual div amount grow. I’ve also been accumulating SCHD for the last 3 years or so. Most of my purchases are ETFs or large/reputable companies that I expect to be around in 10+ years.

For added context/info, I’m 28. I know dividend stocks aren’t totally advisable for someone my age, but increasing my overall earnings keeps me motivated and keeps me investing more consistently; it almost gamifies investing. The way I see it, nothing we do is perfectly optimized. Sure, we could all just put our money into VOO and not ever think about it. We could also eat nothing but steak and salads and rice every day. But we’re all imperfect and personally I enjoy a nice piece of cake and for me dividend stocks/ETFs are just that. Even if it’s not absolutely optimal, these purchases make investing fun and I hope to own enough via accumulation of shares/DRIP to have a steady income stream one day that could cover most/all of my expenses.

I also like the idea of being rewarded for owning a stock, realizing gains without needing to sell shares. Most (maybe 70%) of my dividend stocks/ETFs are in my Roth IRA so my tax drag is low.

Just wanted to share my portfolio/milestone hit. I’m not trying to actively “beat the market”, but I want to enjoy investing and love to see my dividend yield grow every month. I’ll be adding a few more dividend stocks over the remainder of the year — I just bought two shares of PG, one share of ABBV, and two shares of KO this morning, for example. $1,000/month next!

I’ve been so disciplined about reinvesting my distributions every month that it became an essential “expense” like my condo fee or power bill. It never crossed my mind to simply collect them for a few weeks and use them for something else.

I know that sounds silly and that a lot of people pay other expenses with dividends, but for me this is when it really hit me. For the first time I felt a hint of that financial independence and security that I’ve been working toward. I booked my trip and all it is costing me is the few shares that I otherwise would have bought, and I’m okay with that. This is why I invest. This is why dividends add value to my life.

1inaaat,2025-02-11,2025-02-11 16:41:39,$0 to $140/month in dividend income - A regular person's 5-year journey,"https://preview.redd.it/aw8mbjpevkie1.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e5fae49214e26361b2afa8839d333e4c2fecdb6

Hit my first dividend milestone today; $140/month in passive income after 5 years. Here's my journey (nothing crazy, just consistency).

Started this journey back in January 2020 with $500 monthly contributions. Just a regular person aiming to build some passive income. Finally hit $140/month in dividends and wanted to share since this sub helped a lot.

Quick stats:

* Started: January 2020
* Monthly investment: $500
* Total invested: $30,000 ($500 × 60 months)
* Current portfolio value: Approximately $42,000
* Monthly dividend income: $140
* Yield on cost: Approximately 5.6%

The journey:

* 2020: Started with basic ETFs like SCHD and JEPI.
* 2021: Added some blue chips—JNJ, PG, KO.
* 2022: Bear market hit; kept buying and actually increased positions.
* 2023: Started adding some energy stocks—XOM, CVX.
* 2024: Focused on dividend growth stocks.

Biggest lessons:

* Consistency beats timing.
* DRIP is your best friend.
* Track everything.
* Don't chase yield.
* Bear markets are dividend shopping seasons.
* Dividend raises feel like free money.

Nothing spectacular or get-rich-quick here. Just steady contributions and compound interest doing its thing.

Monthly $500 felt like a lot at first, but now it's just part of the budget. Kind of addicting watching those dividend payments grow every quarter.

Next goal is $500/month. Ambitious, but hey, dream big, right?

1nlpty5,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 01:28:52,Retired. Tired of the 4% rule. I just dumped my entire portfolio into 60% SCHD 40% SCHY. I want to set and forget it forever like a trust fund.,"TLDR: Didn’t like how much I still had to manage with the traditional FIRE portfolio. Want my income to truly be passive. Dumped VTI/VEU for SCHD/SCHY. (Both US and Int’l index fund pairs). Will instruct my brokerage to disallow access to my portfolio.

—

Long story long, I was realizing that for the last six years, I was stressing myself out doing research on withdrawal methods, withdrawal rates, how to adjust withdrawals in an up market and the down market and learning about all of those methodologies, asset, allocation, bonds, sequence of withdrawal risk, etc. Every time I did research, I wanted to tinker and adjust my portfolio based on a new philosophy, and I’m getting really tired of it.

I have to open my portfolio every time I want to sell my stocks to make a withdrawal and that just encourages me to tinker. It’s just my personality. I can’t do anything about it. This also encouraged me to react to the market because I could see my entire network going up and down every time I open my portfolio.

A few days ago I literally just dumped my entire portfolio into two dividend ETFs because I am realizing how much I value simplicity and I want to set up my investments like basically a set it and forget it trustfund that pays me every month. I will also be instructing my brokerage to not allow me to have online access unless I go into a physical brokerage to make it harder for me to trade. Especially seeing as I live outside of the United States and I would have to take a flight back to place a trade or adjust my portfolio.

I’m sort of looking at this like a trust fund that is being managed by the corporations who choose to pay me dividends and they adjust how much they pay me in the markets and the markets based on the health of their companies and the economy.

I wanted a simple US dividend fund and a simple international dividend fund. I tried to wait the allocation roughly with the weight of VT (total world market fund) so it’s about 60/40.

Thoughts? Knowing I want to keep things simple and tinker free. Anything inherently wrong with this? I know I could probably diversify into different sectors and this and that but again I really don’t want to do any more research. 

I just want my money to work for me and give me passive income. It’s the whole reason I wanted to save money so I never have to think about it again. 

Portfolio size is….substantial. Schwab investment income puts it at roughly $27,000/ month (before tax) and I would be okay with dividends getting cut in half for a bit so long as I know I won’t go to zero and that the income will eventually recover. Im not adding this to brag but to give context. I probably spend like $10k/month on myself. The rest goes into savings for fun spending. So in down years I would just cut down on some of the fun and luxury.

The initial capital was less than $10,000. The goal was simple: to create a passive cash flow that could grow continuously.

The strategy I follow is very simple: Only buy companies with stable fundamentals and a history of Dividend distribution (such as Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings). Give priority to the dividend growth rate rather than simply high returns. Increase positions when the market declines, especially for high-quality companies. Reinvest all dividend income to maintain compound growth and do not focus on stock prices. Only focus on the growth trend of forward dividend income

Each day I go into work I track my days and then I invest one share of a dividend income stock.  Right now it costs about 27 bucks for the share, it pays quarterly, however  I track it via monthly income so 8.5 cents it pays.  So for 5 days I build 42.5 cents of income that is monthly going to come back to me every single month in the future! 

  
Also I go to the gym 4 days a week typically.  So long as  go each visit I allow myself 1/2 share of stock as well so that is another 2 shares of stock so another 17 cents. So that is 59.5 cents each week I am building in endless income! 

  
52x59.5 thats 3,094 pennies or 30.94 x 10 years thats 309.4 or 618.8 for 20 years! 

  
Yes, im turning 40 this year and had I been doing this I would have been making... lets say 600 bucks ( accounting for days  I didn't work or what)  by now doing that alone!!!! I wish I understood this when I was 20 years old just starting! If you are in your 20's consider somthing like this that motivates you to keep going and building your wealth.  

  
I mean 600 bucks isn't tons to retire on but if I was in between jobs  and had 600 monthly income going 2 months without work wouldn't be a sweat at all provided I still have a nest egg of an emergency fund but yea.. 

I am also planning buying another stock one per day that costs around 5 buck but pays out 4 cents in monthly income.  If I don't buy anything for lunch and instead pack a lunch which is cheaper than buying stuff at work then I can buy another ONE share per week.  so that would help me stay motivated to eat cheaper lunches and invest another 20 cents  a week as well. 

I still do invest all my left over monthly cash into stocks to build that divd income but for those two stocks I am not going to invest in and the only way I can get more is by ""earning them"" from these rules. 

  
May seem unnessary but it is a great way to motivate me and keep me on track at work, gym, and on lunch!  Thought it be good to share as it might help others become motivated as well and change it as they like...

1m46x5w,2025-07-19,2025-07-19 17:00:25,Did I join an S&P 500 cult by mistake?,"Is it just me, or has dividend investing basically disappeared from most investing discussions?

Everywhere I look, it’s either:

“Just buy VOO or SPY and never think again.”

or worse:

“I DCA into VTI and reinvest dividends bro, you’re doing it wrong if you’re picking stocks.”

Don't get me wrong. I appreciate simplicity and passive investing. It works, especially for beginners. But this ETF only mindset feels like it’s become a religion, not a strategy.

Seems like people don't even understand what's in these funds, let alone the overlap, weightings, or sector risk. Just blind obedience to a ticker.


What happened to actual investing?
Dividend Growth Investing (DGI) used to be respected:

Reliable income

Long-term compounding

Mental ownership of businesses

A real focus on cash flow, not stock price only

Now? You bring up dividends and get dogpiled by what I can only call the Growth Cult Gestapo - ready to correct your ""ignorance"" with the holy trinity of:
“Total return!”
“Yield is a trap!”
“Just buy the index!”

I came for investing. I found an ETF fan club.
Ask about $HD or $O → “Just buy VOO”
Mention yield or cash flow → “That’s boomer talk”
Say you like dividends → “You’re doing it wrong”

Seriously… did I stumble into a forum about investing, or just an ETF subreddit in disguise?

Can we please have both?
Why has it become taboo to even talk about dividends? How did it turn into growth vs. income instead of a balanced strategy discussion?

Can we normalize the idea that:

Dividend investing isn't outdated

Income-focused portfolios make sense for many goals

ETFs are great - but not sacred

Risk-adjusted yield matters

Just finished reading it and it brought me SO much comfort in designing my portfolio, and the fears of how market allocation and downturns can go. 

I find a lot of people in the subreddit ask the same questions, or have really chaotic portfolios and this book gave me model portfolios, and 3 types of dividend portfolios that are exactly what we as dividend income investors, or dividend growth investors are looking for. 

Whether you're a purely dividend *only* investor and share price is irrelevant, Or a dividend growth investor and share price and dividend are important this book has good info for you. 

My favorite take away was ""as the market declines your income goes up"" and a very good and healthy understanding of what ""return of capital"" is. 

It's also got me considering investing in CLOs. 
The model portfolios range depending on what kind of 'income factory' or 'income factory light' you want to pursue. Turns out my plan and current portfolio (before reading this book) was income factory light.

1ng6f4z,2025-09-13,2025-09-13 15:26:45,Living off dividends was my dream… but as a Polish investor I just discovered the 40% U.S. estate pay trap,"Hey everyone,

For years my dream was simple: to save enough so that I could live off dividends. I finally reached that point – I’ve been investing through Tastytrade into U.S. ETFs (mainly SCHD and some VGT), and I’ve built up a serious portfolio.

I’m 27, married, with a little daughter. I always imagined dividends as the foundation of financial security for my family – stability during my life, and something I could eventually pass down.

I also considered real estate, but honestly? It’s not as attractive anymore. ROI is low, demographics in Poland are bad, and I don’t believe property prices will keep growing like they did in the past. That’s why I went all-in on stocks and dividends.

And then I discovered the U.S. estate tax rules. Here’s the painful part:

* As a non-U.S. resident, if I hold more than **$60,000 in U.S. assets (stocks/ETFs)**, my heirs could face up to **40% estate tax** when I die.
* It doesn’t matter that I live in Poland and already pay taxes here – the U.S. only cares that the securities are listed in America, so they treat them as “U.S. assets” and apply estate tax.
* With my current portfolio, I already fall into the **highest bracket: 40% estate tax**.
* And Poland has **no estate tax treaty with the U.S.**, so I’m fully exposed.

This hit me very hard. My biggest fear is that if something happens to me, my wife and daughter won’t just lose me – they could also lose almost half of what I’ve been building for years. It feels like they’d be robbed of the very security I wanted to leave them.

People often suggest UCITS ETFs in Europe as an alternative. But let me be blunt: **UCITS ETFs are terrible compared to the U.S. ones – much more expensive, worse in performance, and with far fewer choices.** For someone who spent years building a strategy around SCHD and similar funds, switching to UCITS feels like a huge downgrade.

I know there are ways around this (family foundations, trusts, private banking), but honestly? It hurts that my dream of living off dividends turned out to be so complicated.

👉 I’d especially like to hear from people who have actually dealt with this issue in real life – how did you solve it? Did you set up a trust, a foundation, or just accept the risk? I don't know.. maybe I should just sell everything and transfer money to European broker and buy nasdaq etf and wait, or maybe buy some real estate. Ehh.

(PS: I used ChatGPT to help me phrase this better in English, since I’m Polish and wanted to make sure I expressed it clearly.)",397,222,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1ng6f4z/living_off_dividends_was_my_dream_but_as_a_polish/,year,Discussion,0.9

Although I am a young investor, my advice may seem outdated. But this is what helped me
1. When choosing dividends, do not immediately rush to the dividend yield, especially the high one (I was sinned by this). First, evaluate the payment history (frequency and amount) and the dividend growth
2. Diversify, distribute your investments by sectors. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, don't take risks (and don't invest a lot of money at once, it's risky too)
3. Reinvest the dividends to achieve more growth
4. Decide on the goal and its amount. At the moment, my minimum goal is 8k per year, but I want to create a source of passive income that will eventually be able to cover my basic expenses and ensure a “comfortable” future
5. Read the literature, watch YouTube, use services for analysis. This is the most obvious advice that will help you figure it all out more

7% dividend yield at this level. They have a pipeline of potential oncology and hematology drugs that could start to move the needle in the next few years. 

From a TA perspective, It’s trading in the middle of its Bollinger band and far below both the 50-day and 200-day average, but if it breaks through $24, it could go to $25-27 in the near future. If not, it could drop back into the $22 range. Either way, if you are a dividend investor, this might be a time to consider PFE.

1lmljff,2025-06-28,2025-06-28 08:22:36,Many of you would have sold KO in 2003,"On January 30, 2003 stock of The Coca-Cola Company fell under $20 for the first time since early 1996, approaching what would become a 7-year low for this iconic brand. It fell even further over the next month, even as the company announced another dividend increase of 10%.

If this subreddit existed in 2003, the discussion would have been extremely negative towards KO. It would have been called a loser stock spending all of its money on dividends at the expense of growth. There would have been many questions about better investment choices, perhaps beaten down technology stocks or the industrial sector. Some of you would have (correctly) suggested that housing would heat up in the coming years. The health food trend was beginning and sugary drinks and unhealthy snacks will be left behind, is how every discussion would begin and end. Coca-Cola was going to slowly fade away into the corporate graveyard where so many other great brands have ended up.

Over 20 years later, KO has instead more than tripled in stock price and generated an annual return of 8.8% with dividends reinvested. You all now call it a great company with a superior product. 

But mark my words, this cycle will happen again for KO and nearly EVERY great company. The market has periods of wild exuberance and horrible despondency. Companies miss guidance and fall 10% overnight. Great investors must find those great businesses and buy more when these opportunities arise. 

Before I end this post, I hope you all see the parallels to the current status of PEP, SBUX, NKE, BBY, UPS, and many other iconic brands. At or near 5 year lows, these companies are being heavily discounted by the market. (Disclosure: I own PEP, SBUX, and UPS)

1ny9jmn,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 20:00:27,PizzaTrader Stock of the Month: October 2025,"Those of you who have followed along with my posts have hopefully learned that market pessimism towards high quality companies presents opportunity. At this moment, restaurants and companies supporting the restaurant industry are slightly beaten down. This will allow us to grab future cash flows at a discount and improve our chances for price gains over the long term.

This month’s featured stock is Domino’s Pizza (DPZ).
Disclosure: I own a position and presently intend to hold into the future. 
Disclaimer: For educational purposes only, not investment advice.

Business Model:
DPZ earns income from royalties and franchise fees from over 20,000 retail pizza stores, as well as the sale of ingredients and supplies to those franchisees.

Dividend Highlights:
- The current dividend is $6.96 annually, translating to a yield of 1.63% at the current stock price of $426.71.

- DPZ has increased its dividend for 11 consecutive years.

- The average dividend yield over the past 10 years has been 1.06%. Therefore, today’s investor will purchase a cash flow stream 59% more valuable than the long-term average.

- I typically aim for a 15% Chowder Ratio with new stock purchases. DPZ has an excellent Chowder Ratio of 19.04%!

Investment Performance:
- An investor who bought $10,000 worth of DPZ 10 years ago and reinvested all dividends would have experienced total returns of 344.56% with a current value of $44,456. This performance defeated broad market indexes (like the S&P 500), although this performance may not continue into the future.

- The 2015 investor initially bought the stock at a yield of 1.14%, expecting $1.24 per share in their first year of ownership. Today, that same investor is set to earn $6.96 per share, resulting in a yield on cost of 6.42%. As with all of my Stock of the Month selections, patience has paid off for long-term investors!

Future Outlook:
- While the future is always uncertain, investing in Domino’s comes with several potential rewards, including annual dividend increases, price improvements, and high likelihood for ongoing dividends. 

- The company’s annual dividend is typically announced early each year.  The dividend increase in 2025 was an excellent 15.2% and has been double digits over each of the last 10 years!

- The company’s dividend payout ratio is 40%, a healthy ratio which would allow dividends to double over the next 5 years (14% CAGR) without requiring any earnings growth.

- There is also an opportunity for price improvement. Assuming a steady dividend growth rate of 15% until 2030, and a return to the average dividend yield of 1.06%, today’s investor might have stock worth $1,301.89 (205% price return) and earn a yield on cost of 3.23%.
 
Conclusion:
-  For the above reasons, DPZ is my choice for Stock of the Month and is well-positioned to continue its long-term creation of shareholder wealth. 

Portfolio Performance:
The Stock of the Month portfolio (nine months so far), is up 10.8% in price and has earned 1.26% in dividends for a total return (dividends not reinvested) of 12.1%. This is favorable to SCHD’s 4.02% total return over the same time period.

If you automatically reinvest dividends, what happens if the dividends are not enough to cover the purchase of a single share? Do they accrue over time until they reach the sum that can cover the purchase of a holding? 

For example, each share of VOO costs $615.17

Let's suppose I buy 5 of them and set to automatically reinvest the dividends. The dividends that 5 shares of VOO pay are not sufficient to buy another single share of VOO. So, what happens in that case? In my opinion, the most logical explanation is that the dividends accrue until they reach $615.17 and that is when the automatic purchase is made.

1nxvxu3,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 10:47:36,A tech stock with 2% yield just beat every utility in our dividend rankings.,"Our systematic dividend framework ranked QUALCOMM #1 in October. Not a utility. Not a REIT. A semiconductor company yielding 2.09%.

If that surprises you, your screening process might be filtering out quality before you ever evaluate it.

**What happened:**  
We score every S&P 500 dividend payer monthly using identical criteria: sustainability (30%), growth (25%), yield quality (25%), and consistency (20%). See further details in this post:   
  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1mpx2n6/why\_we\_stopped\_chasing\_high\_yields\_and\_built\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1mpx2n6/why_we_stopped_chasing_high_yields_and_built_this/)  


QUALCOMM scored 7.9/10 with near-perfect sustainability metrics:

* 32% payout ratio (paying less than 1/3 of earnings)
* \>9 consecutive years of 7% dividend growth
* Perfect free cash flow coverage
* A balance sheet that can weather severe downturns

**Why this matters:**  
Most dividend investors start by filtering sectors: Utilities + REITs + Consumer Staples only. Then sort by yield, highest first.

That approach eliminates QUALCOMM before you ever look at the fundamentals. Wrong sector. Low yield. Never considered.

We picked it in August at $150.58. By October, it hit $166.36 (+10.5% dividend-adjusted). Three months is obviously too short to validate any methodology, but it demonstrates the concept: we identified sustainable quality before price reflected it, not by predicting movement but by evaluating fundamentals systematically.

**The challenge to conventional wisdom:**  
Traditional dividend screening assumes quality lives in specific sectors. But business models evolved. Technology companies with licensing revenue now generate more stable cash than many cyclical industrials or retailers. A 2% yield backed by a 32% payout ratio will compound for decades. A 6% yield at 80% payout has nowhere to go but down.

We weight sustainability heaviest (30% of score) for one reason: dividend cuts destroy you twice. Capital loss + income loss. Finding companies that won't cut matters more than finding companies yielding 6% today.

1nxs9jj,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 08:09:04,Novo Nordisk (NVO): A 46.5% ARR Opportunity and a 2.9% Starting Yield,"NVO is currently trading at $59.63 against my calculated fair value of $88, suggesting a potential **46.5% anticipated annual rate of return** (ARR) over the next 3 years. This ARR is based on consensus revenue estimates and regression analysis of median-reverting metrics like EV/Revenue and Price-to-Book ratios, essentially projecting where the stock should trade as valuations normalize.

As far as quality:

**Gross Margins at 83.9%** is outstanding. For context, pharma companies typically run 60-80% gross margins, so NVO is at the upper end. The chart shows remarkable stability around 80-85% over the past decade, indicating strong pricing power and efficient manufacturing.

**Operating Margins of 45.8%** demonstrates excellent operational efficiency. While pharma can range from 20-50%, NVO's consistent 40%+ shows they're converting those high gross margins into actual operating profit effectively.

**Interest Coverage at 16.9x** means the company earns nearly 17 times what it needs to service debt. Anything above 5x is considered safe; this is fortress-level financial stability.

The one yellow flag is the **Cash Conversion at 55.8%**, which is below the ideal 80-100% range, suggesting some gap between reported earnings and actual cash generation. Worth monitoring.

With the GLP-1 market exploding and NVO dominating the space, do you all view this valuation gap as a genuine opportunity or are there demand sustainability concerns I'm missing?",36,22,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nxs9jj,new,Due Diligence,0.85
1nxrqqp,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 07:42:11,Dividend Strategy - Ireland,"I (32m) really like the idea of dividend investing - I'm really drawn to the idea of semi-stable monthly/quarterly income generated from the money I've earned through work. 

That being said, I'm in the younger side and the prevailing wisdom is growth over dividend until much later in life.

So at the start of this year, after some research, I decided to invest monthly in three etfs - iShares core world IWDA (growth), Vanguard S&P 500 VUSA (growth) and JPM global premium equity JEPG (dividend). With some heavy investing and some restrictions on cost/qualiry of living (not monk level, minor stuff)

My ultimate goal, like many, is to get to a point where my baseline costs of living is covered if/when something happens to my full time job. 

I had a 33.33% DCA split for the first few months but then I got a bit impatient, sold my positions in IWDA and VUSA and concentrated on getting JEPG to a significant point. 

Now, we're coming toward the end of the year. My JEPG position is ~4000 shares (~€92k) and the dividend has been significantly lower than i had modeled (~.15 per share monthly compared to ~.2 modelled) and due to the weak dollar I'm down overall. 

I'm kind of ok with this position, it earns me gross ~€500 euro a month, maybe more, maybe less, and will build. But I expected to be closer to net €500 a month by the end of the year. 

I suppose the question is, is this the best thing to do with your investing capital? Are there better ways to use my money to generate a secondary income? I also really hate the high tax on this in Ireland so any suggestions on how to minimise the tax drag would be amazing. 

Any general critiques of this approach or suggestions on better approaches specific to Irish investors would be great!

**Valuation:** Low teens P/E. Close (enough) to historically low Price-to-Gross-Profit Ratio.

**Dividend Coverage Ratio:** Like 50%. Unlike some companies (glares at $UPS), they didn't raise their dividend during the ephemeral demand boom during COVID. Based capital management.

**Dividend growth prospects:** Estimating an average of 8% dividend growth per year, for the next 12 years. That will take it from 5.12% current yield, to 12.92% in 2037. If I'm within 4% of that goal, I'll be happy.

But this eerily resembles the madness around covid time when QYLD suddenly shot out into the daylight. Every other post either demonized it or praised it as if this was the messiah that would help dividend lovers retire. Every tom dick and harry was writing about it, on blogs/you tube/reddit. 

Have a look at the chart below. Although it was well know that QYLD suffered from NAV erosion, it actually did well for 8 years or so by recovering to its inception price of 25 bucks - twice. In other words, it did rise when markets kept rising. Not bad if something delivers 10% and has a modest NAV erosion. BUT then some thing happened right around Feb 2020  - It just started nose diving and has not been able to rise again even though markets have far surpassed the ATH of Feb 2020.

I don't know what exactly changed in 2020. But i worry that similar fate may be in store for cc etfs that are being touted today by rainy season frogs. Although the initial performance of these is quite good but so was QYLD for  god damn 8 years.

1nwnzek,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 23:02:20,Mortgage payoff vs dividend investing,"TL;DR - Pay off mortgage = true wealth long term. Not pay off mortgage but invest = more $ up front if we have a prolonged bull market and asset prices keep going up.

\---------  
Hi All. I get see a lot of posts, and I get asked often ""is it better to pay off my house with a lump sum, then invest that mortgage amount each month, or to invest in dividends and use those payments to help pay off the house"".

I ran the financials on a few scenarios and the general consensus is this:

In terms of raw, wealth creation paying off the mortgage and investing the mortgage amount each month creates a higher number. Ie you have more positive NET WORTH and you have more true ""money/wealth"". However, the net-present-value of your networth takes a hit. This is because money now is worth much more than money in the future.

**Take away;  if you want future value, and strong real wealth, pay off your mortgage and invest.**

In terms of present value of your money, and your view of the future in terms of real estate prices, stock market prices, inflation etc, then NOT paying off your mortgage and investing the money provides more value right here right now, and LESS real wealth over time. Over the same period of time you have a lower net worth and are much more sensitive to changes in the market/prices/rates/etc.

**Take away: if you believe in ""up only"" for the duration of your mortgage then do not pay off your mortgage but invest the money.**

The ""right"" decision is one has to make for themselves and there are many ethereal factors, such as risk appetite, known-unknowns, unknown-unknowns, ""what happens if I lose my job"", sickness, un-forseen life changes etc. 

The route I advise and the route I personally took, is to pay off the debt, and I use that monthly amount to invest into my dividend portfolio. I am pretty risk averse, and my plan is to leave everything to my children for generational wealth.

1nwm5ni,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 21:32:31,Investment Advice,"Sorry for the length but Pretty much the title.
Recently my grandfather passed. It’s been really hard. My grandma just mailed me a check from money that was left from the fund he was using to go on trips with her the past decade. It’s several thousand. I’m in my mid 20s and have never been able to save for shit. I’ve never possessed more than several hundred maybe a thousand at any moment except for the stimulus check. That’s the most I’ve ever had. And I splurged it on dumb shit since it hit my bank account while I was on a cross country road trip vacation with a friend since I went on the trip only having like $500 and it was pretty rough haha. 

Anyways, if left to my own devices it’ll slowly widdle away over the next few months between bills and small shit that adds up. Note, I never make big purchases even when it saves money long term due to feeling anxiety about spendigg by money. So, for example, I’ll end up spending $5 here and $10 there until it ends up being several hundred over the course of a month. I’ve been needing to get stuff for the past year. I’ve wanted to get a new microphone and headphones and audio interface for my studio (I make music on the side, but it’s not a necessity which is why I haven’t been able to save for it) and I haven’t been able to save up enough to take a trip to see my friends since I moved almost 4 years ago, and it’s been lonely not having any friends here. I wasn’t able to see them last year. So I want to do that this month when everyone gets together for the Halloween party.
 
So to put it frankly I want to learn how to invest my money in a way that will earn money quickly. I don’t want to use any of it. So I don’t mind putting like $2k in some long term fund. But I know with stocks you put in $500 and after 5 years you have $550, and even tho it is assured profit I don’t want to waste it sitting around for years just to make 5% interest. I want to invest it wisely in ways that can make money fast. Double in in a few months kinda fast. Turn $5000 into $6000 within a month so I can see my friends speed. 

I know there’s no real get rich quick scheme, and Ik there’s no easy money methods. But I do know there are ways to make money fast IF you already have a sizeable chunk of money to work with. Which I previously didn’t have. It’s hard to start investing when $10 invests to $15 over a few days or whatever. But if you do the same with $1000 that’s $1500. $5000 that’s $7500. 

I just don’t know where to start or what to do. I don’t want to fuck this up like everything else I do. I want to use this to change my future. 
 
If I can turn $5000 into $10000 that’s not just getting my wants. That also can pay the few thousand it costs to go back to college and get my pre-reqs to get into my local technical colleges surgical tech program to start earning my degree for a good paying job. I know I can do it. I just need help. Please. 🙏🏻 
Thank you so much. Hell if any of you have a sure fire method I’d even pay you commission on my first profits if it works LOL.

Again, thank you for your time and help.",5,15,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nwm5ni/investment_advice/,new,Seeking Advice,1.0

\--------------------------------------------  
  
Kraft Heinz announced on September 2, 2025, that it will split into two separate publicly traded companies by the second half of **2026**. 

* One company, temporarily named **Global Taste Elevation Co.**, will focus on sauces, spreads, and shelf-stable meals, including brands like Heinz, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, and Kraft Mac & Cheese.
* The other company, temporarily named **North American Grocery Co.**, will focus on grocery staples, including brands like Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables.

\--------------------------------------------

<snippet from Forbes article, linked>

While the market sees potential for significant value creation if Kraft Heinz’s North American division achieves a meaningful turnaround, the current low single-digit growth expectations suggest it may not justify the approximately $20 billion valuation being attributed to it. However, RemainCo could benefit from a valuation uplift, given its portfolio of high-growth businesses.

Kraft Heinz’s restructuring mirrors a broader industry shift, similar to Kellogg’s 2023 split into Kellanova and WK Kellogg, which helped both companies grow independently. Since then, Kellanova’s stock rose 50.7%, WK Kellogg gained 72.1%, while Kraft Heinz’s shares dropped by 17.5% during the same period. Kraft Heinz has already demonstrated a willingness to pare down its portfolio through the divestment of non-core units, such as its Italian infant nutrition division, signalling that the potential spin-off is part of a larger recalibration of its brand ecosystem. With both Berkshire Hathaway stepping back from board involvement and 3G Capital having exited its stake by the end of 2023, it becomes easier for Kraft Heinz to take a bold step, such as a spin-off.",8,10,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joecornell/2025/09/08/kraft-heinz-to-split-into-two-companies/,new,Discussion,0.83

When a company pays out a dividend, something interesting happens to its stock price—it should fall by about the same amount as the dividend itself.

At least that’s how things normally work but in my opinion this logic does not apply to **beaten down stocks** that pay out a nice dividend. It’s my experience that these types of stocks do not fall by about the same amount of the dividend itself because they are considered cheap due to an underlying risk that usually relate to a lot of recent or current headwinds.

A dividend stock will pay you $X every scheduled or planned period (if the board is consistent).  An equity growth stock grows by valuation and not necessarily a cash flow.

If everything is equal, this is basically a glass half full vs a glass half empty analogy.  For example, if the value of a dividend stock is equal to the value of an growth oriented stock, there should be no major difference (assuming the dividend is reinvested so that in this hypothetical the book value of both types of stock are the same).

However, I feel I am missing some here beyond just the psychology of a dividend paying you (even if reinvested) compare to the growth stock.

I doubt it will continue at this pace, but it's totally possible. And, speculating here, but I think there is a good chance ETH runs to $6k or even $8k by EOY / Q1 2026. Which could give a strong NAV boost and prevent decay for that much longer.

Yeah, it's probably equally as risky as yieldmax funds, but if you agree with the potential eth gains, it could be a money machine for a while. There's even an outside chance that eth and crypto have a multi year rally, which could really make this a cash cow. I guess worst case scenario is like 50% downside in the near term. But practically unlimited money if everything goes right. Or somewhere in between. That is all, best of luck to everyone.

1nva0ve,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 10:39:54,JEPI vs SPYI: Which Do You Like?,"Been comparing JEPI and SPYI lately since they both show up a lot when people talk about income ETFs. On the surface they look similar (covered call strategies with big yields) but the numbers and portfolios tell a different story from my analysis.

I created a hypothetical portfolio on Dividend Watch with $10k invested in both to get a sense of total returns, and other details my broker lacks for these securities.

[$10k comparison, including annual income differences](https://preview.redd.it/9bwoykqxhisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=50788313ebc101ae492cbadb2765eb6cfb9e044a)

If you had put $10K into each a year ago, the results aren’t the same. JEPI would have thrown off about $812 in income with an 8.4% yield, while SPYI would’ve paid closer to $1,200 with an 11.7% yield. Total return was also stronger for SPYI over that stretch.

Looking at dividends, JEPI’s story hasn’t been great. Payouts dropped from $6.36/share in 2022 to about $3.21 this year. That’s a downward trend that makes me cautious. SPYI, on the other hand, is newer but has been ramping up. It paid $1.89 in 2022, jumped to $5.79 in 2023, hit $6.12 in 2024, and even though 2025 is tracking lower at $4.04, the overall trajectory is still more encouraging than JEPI’s slide.

The holdings explain a lot. JEPI spreads things out — tech is its biggest sector but only around 20%, with healthcare, financials, and industrials right behind. SPYI leans more heavily into growth names: tech is over a third of the fund (34%), and then financials, consumer cyclical, and comm services make up most of the rest. It’s more tilted toward the S&P’s heavyweights.

[SPYI breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/ex8u2sr0iisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bd03a41f4bd3dcddbd969615cb16c6130c382c0)

[SPYI dividends](https://preview.redd.it/nhkhktr0iisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=215955f04f63c47077fb5269e4a2efc625291e8d)

[JEPI breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/35ufctr0iisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=65c196905bc91a6058b620e0bd8fa8eaf6e3cbc5)

So the trade-off looks something like this:

* JEPI is the more established, diversified option, but its shrinking payouts are a red flag.
* SPYI is newer and a bit more aggressive, with higher yield and stronger recent results, though its dividend history isn’t as long and the 2025 dip shows it won’t always be smooth sailing.

Curious where people here land... would you rather stick with JEPI’s track record, or take the higher yield and growth from SPYI even if it’s less tested?",47,49,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nva0ve/jepi_vs_spyi_which_do_you_like/,new,Discussion,0.87

Apologies if I'm rule breaking, but I really want to get the perspective of folks in this community as I'm on the verge of doing a huge shift in my strategy after lurking on this board for the past several months.

I'm rolling a 401(k) into an IRA and have decided to go full dividend. I'm 48, financially stable and am not going back to work for at least a year (my wife is a high-earner and we've mapped out a plan). I'm looking to retire for real in about 20 years. We have significant cash liquidity, no debt (other than mortgage), and live comfortably.

The image is my strategy after a lot of research and back and forth. I have about 190k to roll and invest. I just want it to grow - all dividends would be reinvested. Any and all thoughts are welcome and appreciated. My thanks to the community.

Edit - I seem to be getting downvoted. I'm unsure of the purpose of this board if it's not this. If there's some etiquette I've egregiously violated, I'm open to civil feedback. ",11,21,0,dividends,reddit,https://i.redd.it/ib9h1n67gdsf1.png,new,Seeking Advice,0.77

Additional point regarding SCHD, the dow jones index is comprised of companies actually *making physical products*, meaning there is exposure to tariffs.

Today closely checked BIZD holdings because PBDC is like actively managed and has more or less good BDCs with distributions in 5-10% range. So I've checked BIZD. And what the trick with bond allocation? 25%??? Is it normal for this fund? Does someone remember? I've tried to use Wayback Machine and see that few months ago it was more or less similar. Why they are doing this? At first i thought they raised cash to buy smth cheaper but it's passive fund, even active manage PBDC not doing this. I thought maybe it's to reduce volatility but it fell more than PBDC that don't have bonds at all (0.5 to 5%). So again why they are doing this? If they would convert this cash to every other BDC except of arcc and obdc as they already have giant position there they probably even get more yield (every bdc yields more than 4% tBill). So either I am missing smth very obvious like novices confuse \~14% expense ratio or it's just bad etf. Because I can buy on my own arcc+obdc+main+tBill. So anyone has some ideas? Thanks

However, I came across some talk about how not all these ETFs use the same types of options.  Exchange traded options would be the safest, but there are also OTC options, ELNs, and swaps that are often used as well.  These are only as good as the counterparty to the contract. My understanding is that some of the ETFs have grown so large, that they wouldn't be able to get all the options needed through exchanges.  Or, in some cases, the premiums are too low on exchange options, so they seek out these other arrangements.

As we are currently in a bull market, everything has been humming along fine.

1nsmj8i,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 08:00:06,ChatGPT is too generic for investment analysis,"I've been trying to use ChatGPT for investment research but keep hitting the same wall - it gives balanced, generic responses instead of how real investors actually think, plus it doesn't have access to current financial data.

For example, if I ask about Tesla:

  \- ChatGPT: ""Here are pros and cons to consider..."" (using outdated info)

  \- What Charlie Munger would probably say: ""Multiple kill-switches triggered - current debt ratio 2.1x, ROE dropped to 8.2%, avoid immediately""

The problem is ChatGPT is trained to be helpful and neutral, but legendary investors have strong opinions and specific methodologies. Plus it can't access real-time financials or recent news.

So I had this idea: what if someone built AI specifically trained on individual investors with live data integration? Like you could actually chat with:

  \- ""AI Charlie Munger"" using his kill-switch framework + current financials

  \- ""AI Warren Buffett"" applying his moat analysis + recent earnings

  \- ""AI Peter Lynch"" with his growth methodology + latest news

Even better - imagine a ""board meeting"" feature where all three analyze the same stock using current data and you see where they agree vs. disagree.

Key features I'm thinking:

  \- Real-time financial data (earnings, ratios, cash flow)

  \- Recent news integration and sentiment analysis

  \- Opinionated takes based on actual methodologies

  \- Multiple investor perspectives on same stock

  \- Portfolio upload for personalized analysis

I'd honestly pay $25-30/month for something like this vs. fighting with ChatGPT's outdated, generic responses.

Questions:

  1. Would real-time data integration make this significantly more valuable?

  2. What would you pay for specialized AI with live financial data vs. generic tools?

  3. Which legendary investors would you most want to ""chat"" with about current market conditions?

  4. Would you upload your portfolio for multi-investor analysis?

Anyone else frustrated with ChatGPT's limitations for current investment analysis?

1nskvny,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 06:24:58,Dividend investor in Europe: keep Realty Income ($O) or switch to EURO iSTOXX High Dividend Low Volatility 50 ETF?,"I’ve been dividend-investing for a bit and have held Realty Income ($O) for over a year. After digging into the tax side, I realized that in my country (Europe) dividends end up taxed at roughly \~42.5% even though the W-8BEN limits U.S. withholding to 15%.

Given that drag, I’m considering switching the position into an EU-domiciled ETF that tracks the **EURO iSTOXX® High Dividend Low Volatility 50** index to avoid the U.S. withholding and simplify taxes.

**ETF I’m looking at (example):**

* **Invesco EURO STOXX High Dividend Low Volatility UCITS ETF**
   * **Index:** EURO iSTOXX High Dividend Low Volatility 50
   * **ISIN:** IE00BZ4BMM98 — **Ticker:** EHDV (various exchanges)
   * **Structure:** UCITS, Ireland-domiciled, **distributing quarterly**
   * **Replication:** Physical, holds 50 stocks
   * **TER:** **0.30% p.a.**
   * **Fund size:** \~€202m
   * **Current dividend yield:** **\~5.2%**, last 12 months paid \~€1.57 per share (figures per justETF; date on their page Sept 2025)
   * Source: justETF profile; STOXX index page/factsheet. ([justETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BZ4BMM98))



1. For those in Europe facing high effective taxes on U.S. dividends: have you found **EU-domiciled UCITS dividend ETFs** (ideally **“reporting funds”** in your country) that deliver a **higher net-of-tax yield** than EHDV? Any favorites to compare?
2. My understanding is that **$O is a U.S. REIT/stock and not an Austrian-style “reporting fund (Meldefonds).”** If you’re in the EU/Austria, does moving from a U.S. single stock like $O to an **EU-domiciled UCITS reporting fund** materially improve your **after-tax** income?
3. Are there **better products for pure income** (e.g., other EURO STOXX/Europe high-dividend strategies, or even all-Europe high-dividend low-volatility variants) that historically offer a **higher distribution yield** than EHDV without taking on excessive risk?
4. Anything I’m missing re: **withholding tax, tax credits, or broker handling** that would change the O vs. EU-dividend-ETF calculus?

I been thinking about my financial situation.

No credit cards anymore.  19,000 invested making 120 monthly income 73,000 in student loans 30K of that is at 6.8% and the rest are MUCH lower rates around 3-4%

My plan WAS to just grow my monthly income to help cover income based payment.  I make about 45K a year and save EVERYTHING.  Rent is about 800, I own my own old Honda so its reliable with some typical repairs nothing to major.

However I have been thinking about switching my plan.  I have been investing about 800-1200 each month now as that 19K invested started the year around 4 so most of it is VERY recent growth.

Would investing in QQQI and SPYI covered calls ETF's be a win in my situation? 60 cents of monthly income on a 53 buck investment.  I was thinking next two years If I can pump 50,000 into them  THEN I will have a $600 revenue stream that I can then focus on buying SCHD 600 dollars worth every month and then turn my focus to paying down that 30K at 6.8% intrest.

What would you do in my situation.  I have great job but the pay is rather low but I live in a low cost area so it works fine for me. is covered calls ETF's to good to be true? I'm 39 now about to be 40 so I got a good 20 years before I start to retire by going part time. likely will always keep working to some extent cause getting paid to move my body is a good thing I'd say.. even if it's part time in my 70's if I live that long I still want to be bringing in income but I don't want to wait until im 55 to start investing.. idk.. am I doing it wrong? Can't change the past and not get this scam of a degree but what is done is done..

1nrfd7k,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 18:49:06,Advice for 20yr old college student investing with the intent of paying off school,"I’m a 20 (21 soon) year old year sophomore in college who’s gaining monthly income from government benefits. Very fresh and green into investing but I’ve been trying to learn as much as I can recently.

The benefits have been very useful to have during school since I can’t fit in a job without sacrificing a lot of time. However these benefits are only active during the school year. I want to start investing as early as possible to help build long term wealth, but my primary goal is to help pay off school loans. Those loans being priced around $60k not taking into account interest, which fortunately is low. I’m graduating June of 2028. I’m going to school for art , my current career trajectory is looking like becoming a freelancer in editorial and children’s books.

I thought about dividends mostly for the fact that they’d be able to help during times I’m not receiving income during summer (family reasons), which would allow me to DRIP during that time so I’m at least putting in something rather than nothing.

With that being said, I’d be able to invest $200 a month during the school year... September through December, and January through end of April. I’ve been thinking about putting $100 into VOO as a solid foundation for long term sake starting with a growth ETF, then $50 into SCHD to dip my toes in but I’ve heard people on this subreddit saying that’s better for retirement. With the last $50 I thought about putting it into a company stock, maybe holding a slice of Costco.

Would dividends make sense for my personal circumstances or should I focus on a different build?I’m sorry for the noob questions but I’m at the point where I’m trying to think about my future and how rough the job market is and how that would impact me paying off my loans.

It seems like a good middle ground between maximizing growth, total returns and generating retirement income. Also I believe its income is more stable than the income from CC ETFs. If we look through the dividend history of SPY since inception, the dividends decreased in only 3 out of 31 years (09 being the worst at -20%, 05 -2.2%, 01 -5.5%). I assume that QDPL’s dividends (which are supposed to be 4x of S&P 500) would behave same way though I don’t fully understand future contracts to be 100% confident about that. What would be the risk in a retirement strategy with QDPL as the core holding?  
For example: 90% QDPL, 10% Bonds / Cash for those occasional ~1/10 years when dividends decrease. The high/ish expense ratio could be offset by reduced bond  exposure. No need to sell any shares but occasionally when market does really well, you could rebalance or sell some shares to get back to 90/10 (or other desired allocation).

-RM300 for myself (subscriptions, cravings, leisure)

Let me explain my reasoning.

Okay dividend stocks are safer because they are usually more stable companies (longer track record of being profitable, dividend kings are not a thing for no reason I guess). But they offer less growth opportunity, so my current plan is going all in on growth stocks until the age of 40 something then progressively transfer my portfolio to dividend stocks but I would like to get your reasoning because I did some calculations and I don't understand dividend-only people's reasoning (not to criticize, maybe I am the one who's wrong) as the average growth promoted by growth-investors is 10%/year but dividends people tend more to talk about a realistic 6% growth per year + 2% dividends on their side.

So my calculations started there, suppose I invest 100$ a month during 7 years only, the difference is already big:

\- 100$ in growth stocks at 10% yearly growth: [Calculation for growth portfolio](https://www.dunefolio.com/calculator?starting_capital=10000&growth_rate=10&dividends_rate=0&duration=84&monthly_investment=100&yearly_investment=0)

\- 100$ in dividend stocks at 6% yearly growth + 2% dividends: [Calculations for dividends portfolio](https://www.dunefolio.com/calculator?starting_capital=10000&growth_rate=6&dividends_rate=2&duration=84&monthly_investment=100&yearly_investment=0)

Which ends up with 25,000$ for the dividends portfolio and 28,000$ for the growth one.

And I mean you don't even need advanced math, the yearly return is just 10% vs. 8%, the calculation only highlights the gap.

Indeed my point is I don't get it, what is the ultimate advantage to being 'dividend only'.

I will try to get unemployment for a little while but once I have the surgery and am not physically able to work I believe that will disqualify me at that point.  I don’t have significant savings to fall back on but between a severance payment and some savings I will have about 40-50k.  I need something that is gonna generate enough passive income to at least help me get by I have some secondary income of 3-500 a month but that doesn’t even cover my housing expenses.  I figure I could make about 1500 a month work if I lived extremely frugally so I need that 40-50k to generate at least 1000 a month for a few months to a year.  I figure I should probably set aside 10k or so in savings/checking as liquid emergency funds but I don’t want to just drain away my savings over these next few months and have nothing left or almost nothing left when I’m able to work again.  I typically have money invested in standard large cap stocks and excluding when it was really bad during Covid they gained 10-15% yearly but I was only lightly invested in dividend yielding stocks so
I think I got like 100 dollars a year in dividend payments total from chevron and Altria.  

Would investing something like 30k in MSTY be smart at this point with its price steadily declining or is it smart while it’s this low to buy it since the crypto market fluctuates so much.

1npj6lr,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 13:58:51,ROTH IRA vs Personal Investment Account,"Hello all, I am relatively new to investing (within the last 5 years) and currently have two portfolios - a ROTH IRA and a personal investment account. To further clarify, I am a long-term investor (am yet to sell a single share of a single stock) and view these investment accounts as my retirement fund (40ish years down the road).

After doing some more research into the tax benefits of a ROTH IRA I am now faced with this question: should I group all of dividend paying stocks (with DRIP investing) into my ROTH IRA - as I will not be taxed on any dividend payments over the next 40ish years (assuming I do not sell anything in this account till I turn 64 or whatever age the tax-break rule is amended to by then)? 

Then I would group the majority of my growth stocks into my personal investment account (no dividends = no yearly dividend taxes) - that way the only taxes I would pay in this account would be the capital gains taxes when I decide to sell a couple decades down the road?

Or does the real value of a ROTH IRA lay in the fact that capital gains aren’t taxed either (if I pick a stock that goes 50x over the next 40 years in my ROTH, I would not be taxed on any of those gains)?

Curious what you all think, majority of dividend paying stocks in my ROTH IRA? Majority of growth stocks in my ROTH IRA?

Coupling dividends with modest growth has been such a solid strategy for me to keep consistent with investing. I do not panic sell and I do not look at my portfolio everyday to see what the market is doing. 

My biggest positions are the SP500, NASDAQ100 and TSX60 with a few individual companies and covered call ETFs. All positions are attached. 

My goal for now is honestly maintaining a 2.5% yield and getting out of individual companies slowly. Yeah sure its high risk high reward, but I have realized I suck at stock picking and a 80% ETF portfolio would be great. Also getting the covered call ETF portion of my portfolio to 10% would be great. Currently its at \~12%.

Chart go up or chart go down, I buy. Dividends take the stress out and let me focus on other things like how to generate more money to invest etc.

I’ve been hearing so many things about benefits vs downsides of SPYI/QQQI, XYLG/QYLG, and GPIX/GPIQ. And it’s all scattered across the internet I’ve yet to find anything that breaks down the pros and cons with any sort of logic/thought train. I know they’re all high yielders but what is the “best” combo for a taxable brokerage used to supplement income?

I like the Global X funds (XLYG/QYLG) but I think just because of the title “Covered Call & Growth”, implying that besides a hefty payout the funds itself appreciate in NAV. Then the QQQI/SPYI seems to have at least some of the distributions treated as ROC instead of dividends (which would be better in a non-retirement brokerage account). Then GPI Q/X just seem like copy cats of all the same covered call strategies. Ideally I’d like growth and income (wouldn’t we all) but wondering if the naming convention on the Global X funds is misleading me... 

These are just 6 examples of hundreds, I know. Because there’s also JEPQ/JEPI… 🤦🏻‍♂️ they seem to have a longer history and decent stability…. HELP.

I am a young investor (29) and am also a high income healthcare worker that earns over $300K per year combined with my wife. We are trying to create reliable passive income streams to replace our income over time without worrying about market value, 4% rule, etc. 

I understand that many investors do not like CEFs from a tax perspective, as these funds are required to pay out 95% of earnings as taxable dividends to shareholders. As a result, the market value/appreciation may be flat for a very long time. There is also leverage and fees to be aware of. 

However, I also understand that if passive income is the goal, these investments would help meet that goal as opposed to the Bogleheads “VOO and chill” approach that many financial planners recommend. 

On another note, I follow some knowledgeable investors in the CEF space like Steven Bavaria and Steve Selengut, who make the comparison to a “department store”, where you can buy CEFs at a discount and sell them for profit later on to capture some gains. This creates an additional income stream on top of the regular dividend distributions.

Individual picks were originally diversified as 2 tickers per industry/sector. I have slowly been eliminating low yield individual picks.

	1.	IWMI
	2.	IAUI
	3.	IYRI

These are iShares ETFs from BlackRock, and you’re looking for the closest Vanguard alternatives. Let’s break each one down and match them:

⸻

🔹 1. IWMI – iShares MSCI World Islamic UCITS ETF
   •   Focus: Tracks the MSCI World Islamic Index, which screens for Shariah-compliant global companies (removing those involved in alcohol, tobacco, financials, etc.).

✅ Vanguard Equivalent:
   •   No direct Vanguard Islamic ETF exists.
   •   Closest available:
      •   Vanguard FTSE Developed World UCITS ETF (VEVE) – Tracks developed markets globally.
      •   But not Shariah-compliant.

⚠️ Vanguard does not currently offer Shariah-compliant ETFs. You’d have to stick with iShares or other providers (e.g., HSBC, Wahed).

⸻

🔹 2. IAUI – iShares MSCI USA Islamic UCITS ETF
   •   Focus: Tracks MSCI USA Islamic Index (Shariah-compliant U.S. stocks).

✅ Vanguard Equivalent:
   •   Closest available:
      •   Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (VUSA) – Tracks top 500 U.S. companies.
      •   Vanguard U.S. Equity Index Fund – Broader U.S. exposure.
      •   But again, not Shariah-compliant.

⚠️ No Shariah-compliant U.S. ETF from Vanguard.

⸻

🔹 3. IYRI – iShares MSCI World Islamic UCITS ETF – Dist (distributing version)
   •   This is the distributing (dividend-paying) version of IWMI.

✅ Vanguard Equivalent:
   •   Same issue: No Shariah-compliant option.
   •   Closest would be:
      •   Vanguard FTSE Developed World UCITS ETF (VEVE) – Distributing version.

⸻

✅ Summary Table

iShares ETF (You Mentioned)	Focus	Vanguard Equivalent	Notes
IWMI	MSCI World Islamic	None (VEVE is closest)	Not Shariah-compliant
IAUI	MSCI USA Islamic	VUSA / U.S. Equity Index Fund	Not Shariah-compliant
IYRI	Same as IWMI (Distributing)	VEVE (distributing)	Not Shariah-compliant

1nnz87l,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 17:30:58,Research For Success,"I mean no disrespect to anyone, but I'm amazed at how many people ask ""what should I do"" in regards to their portfolios or what they should buy or sell. 

Do the research, learn how the markets work, learn the indicators to help you make a decision, and go forward.

When I first started seriously investing for retirement when I was in my early 30s, I had no clue how the markets worked. So I started reading & learning...and this was before internet resources were available. I had our funds at a brokerage where an agent made the buying & selling decisions for us. Soon learned that the vast majority of investors made the decisions over what to buy and sell even using a firm, and I recognized I had started doing that too.

So I cancelled the managed account and transferred holdings to a discount brokerage, E-Trade. I later left E-Trade and now have been with Schwab for over 30 years, and they are great.

I haven't asked anyone for advice for over 35 years now and rely on my own knowledge, experience, and confidence on buying & selling.

When I was 36 & wife was 34, we had $5,000 to our name and were about $18,000 in debt. We are now 70 & 68 and own our home ($650k) debt free with about $1.4M in retirement accounts with $400,000 in Roths. No other debt at all.

While we both did have a 401k with our respective employers, they were immediately rolled to Schwab IRAs when we retired. We started the Roths separately.

I've made mistakes in the past and will likely make mistakes in the future, but mistakes are what you learn from and help make future success.

I implore everyone to start studying finance and investing and have the confidence in your decisions. Most of the folks posts I read in r/dividends give a lot of advice, but are wrong in the comments they make. Not everyone, as some commenters are very aware and knowledgeable, but a larger percentage are clueless.

After I left the managed brokerage, I've never listened to anyone who said...you should buy this...or...you own that!!?!...you should sell. Conversely, I've never recommended to anyone else what they should buy, even when they asked my advice. Instead, I tried to give them the tools to make those decisions themselves. 

The only advice I gave to a friend was back in 2007/8 when markets were getting ready to tank and the real estate bubble burst. I told him I sold everything and saved several $100,000 in losses. He said.. ""why didn't you tell me?"" I said, ""I did, you chose to ignore me.""  The market indicators just worried me then and I luckily made the decision to get out. It didn't take long before I did some bottom feeding and got back in. 

Once again, learn how the system works and be confident in your decisions. Don't rely on another person to qualify your decisions...be confident!!

After talking with the AI it has recommended me O (Realty Income Corp) and PFLT (Pennantpark Floating Rate Capital Ltd). 

My current criteria for evaluating dividend stocks are low fluctuation in stock price, never or rarely decreasing a dividend (preferably increasing the dividend), not cutting dividend during bear markets. 

What else should I be looking for when looking into dividend stocks?

I get there would be a tax hit from reallocating depending on the account type, and I also understand it may be dependent on your time horizon, but if you're someone like me who doesn't intend on touching this money for another 30-40 years, I don't see how a portfolio of mature div stocks making a 2%-4% dividend yield with little growth potential is advantageous to compounding cap gains in the S&P.

I hit my goal of a large weekly income, so now I'm stumped on where to go, as I want to get away from weeklies, and start building a 'base' for the portfolio of steady monthly income payers, or dividend growth payers.

Basically from here where would you guys go, I'm deciding between the following:

* **Monthly Income (Funds that pay the same every month) - includes -15% withholding tax on U.S. funds:**
   * $PREF.TO (Preferred Split Corp. Fund of Funds) - 6.49% yield
   * $HDIF (Harvest Fund of Funds) - 10% yield
   * $PDIV (Non-Leverage, Dividend + option) - 12% yield
   * $PDI (Global Debt/Loans) - 11% yield
   * $YYY (Multiple Income Fund of Funds (mostly Blackrock)) - 10% yield



* **Quarterly Hikers (dividend growth companies) includes -15% withholding tax on U.S. stocks:**
   * $OZK (Financial | hikes: 1,4,7,10) - 2.8% yield (each hike: +2%)
   * $HESM (Midstream | hikes: 2,5,8,11) - 7% yield (each hike: +1-4%)
   * $EQB.TO (Financial | hikes: 3,6,9,12) - 2.3% yield(each hike: +3-5%)

Honestly, I just like these, but the increase in every payout is nice to see as well.

I want to set and forget it forever like a trust fund.,"TLDR: Didn’t like how much I still had to manage with the traditional FIRE portfolio. Want my income to truly be passive. Dumped VTI/VEU for SCHD/SCHY. (Both US and Int’l index fund pairs). Will instruct my brokerage to disallow access to my portfolio.

—

Long story long, I was realizing that for the last six years, I was stressing myself out doing research on withdrawal methods, withdrawal rates, how to adjust withdrawals in an up market and the down market and learning about all of those methodologies, asset, allocation, bonds, sequence of withdrawal risk, etc. Every time I did research, I wanted to tinker and adjust my portfolio based on a new philosophy, and I’m getting really tired of it.

I have to open my portfolio every time I want to sell my stocks to make a withdrawal and that just encourages me to tinker. It’s just my personality. I can’t do anything about it. This also encouraged me to react to the market because I could see my entire network going up and down every time I open my portfolio.

A few days ago I literally just dumped my entire portfolio into two dividend ETFs because I am realizing how much I value simplicity and I want to set up my investments like basically a set it and forget it trustfund that pays me every month. I will also be instructing my brokerage to not allow me to have online access unless I go into a physical brokerage to make it harder for me to trade. Especially seeing as I live outside of the United States and I would have to take a flight back to place a trade or adjust my portfolio.

I’m sort of looking at this like a trust fund that is being managed by the corporations who choose to pay me dividends and they adjust how much they pay me in the markets and the markets based on the health of their companies and the economy.

I wanted a simple US dividend fund and a simple international dividend fund. I tried to wait the allocation roughly with the weight of VT (total world market fund) so it’s about 60/40.

Thoughts? Knowing I want to keep things simple and tinker free. Anything inherently wrong with this? I know I could probably diversify into different sectors and this and that but again I really don’t want to do any more research. 

I just want my money to work for me and give me passive income. It’s the whole reason I wanted to save money so I never have to think about it again. 

Portfolio size is….substantial. Schwab investment income puts it at roughly $27,000/ month (before tax) and I would be okay with dividends getting cut in half for a bit so long as I know I won’t go to zero and that the income will eventually recover. Im not adding this to brag but to give context. I probably spend like $10k/month on myself. The rest goes into savings for fun spending. So in down years I would just cut down on some of the fun and luxury.

1nl4p4v,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 10:13:02,Dividend Tracking Apps Ranked [Updated],"I while back I made a post ranking all of my favorite dividend tracking apps and got tons of recommendations in the comments of amazing dividend tracking apps i've never tried before. So, I thought I would do a revisit to the list and update it after trying out all of the new apps I was recommended.

So here is my list of top dividend and portfolio tracking apps ranked...

[https://snowball-analytics.com/](https://snowball-analytics.com/) \- 8/10 - Really good if you want more in depth analytics on your computer, but the mobile version isn't my favorite and their premium version feels a little overpriced.

DivTracker (the palm tree one) - 7/10 - I like this one because its free and pretty generous, but its the only one with ads which you can pay to have removed. It has all the analytics and features you'd expect and feels good on the phone. Link: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dividend-tracker-stock-market/id1564179613](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dividend-tracker-stock-market/id1564179613)

[https://thedividendtracker.com/](https://thedividendtracker.com/) \- 0/10 - I downloaded the mobile version and could not figure out for the life of me how to add stocks to the portfolio, you might need to do it on the web version, idk

[https://divtracker.app/](https://divtracker.app/) \- 7/10 - This one is just a super solid and robust choice, they don't have anything fancy, but it does what it does super well and the premium version is a good deal.

[https://stockevents.app/](https://stockevents.app/) \- 9/10 - This has been a long time favorite of mine. I really like how they did their mobile app, it feels very polished and high quality. I also like their web version a ton. Great app especially if you want to track all the different dividend events (such as earnings, ex dates, and more). The only thing holding it back is there was no brokerage linking for the paid version and you could only set one goal at a time.

[https://plainzer.com/](https://plainzer.com/) \- 7/10 - There is no IOS version of the app that I could find and the android version felt a bit basic, but the web version was very clean and had all the features you'd expect from a good dividend tracking tool.

[https://trackyourdividends.com/](https://trackyourdividends.com/) \- 6/10 - No mobile version at all and the web version is pretty basic, not that being super basic is bad, it does have a very clean and minimalistic view that feels nice to look at.

[https://delta.app/en](https://delta.app/en) \- 7/10 - I have only tried their mobile app and thought it was really good, it is more of a general portfolio tracker, less focused on dividends but still really solid choice.

[https://divstash.app/](https://divstash.app/) \- 10/10 - This app is newer, but this is my new favorite tracking app. It feels a lot like Stock Events, but the premium version comes with brokerage linking. Also because I am a super goal oriented investor I really enjoy how they let you create multiple super customized goals for your portfolio. Its also run by just one guy so its really impressive what he has done. (They also just added it to Android)

There were other options that I also tried out but none of them were really good enough to be added to the list.

TL;DR Same result as last time: [https://divstash.app/](https://divstash.app/) and [https://stockevents.app/](https://stockevents.app/) are my personal favorite apps with DivStash being better for me because of highly customizable goals and automatic portfolio tracking, the only reason I would go with another option would be if you want super in depth portfolio analytics on the web version then I would go with [https://snowball-analytics.com/](https://snowball-analytics.com/)

(All the apps are free too)

Again these are all just my opinions after trying each app.

So [https://divstash.app/](https://divstash.app/) is my winner, but I am curious what you guys think.",72,43,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nl4p4v/dividend_tracking_apps_ranked_updated/,new,Opinion,0.93

Right now it's just in a MMF earning 4% which is about 450 a month.

At 100k into qqqi it would generate roughly 14k a year in dividends. I'd like to preserve capital as much as possible if I did need to sell shares for cash to pay off the heloc.  It's also possible I may sell my house in the future in which case the heloc would get paid off anyway.

Curious if anyone has any thoughts on this or has done something similar.  If I didn't need the cash at all I would just stick it in an index fund and call it a day but I'm just trying to find a way to make the payments to free up cash for other wants/needs. 

I guess the other argument would be to pay off the heloc and if I needed cash I could always just borrow from the heloc.  It's nice having the cash in my account though. ",4,20,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nkvvgg/heloc_and_qqqi/,new,Discussion,0.64

1nkch3r,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 12:08:41,JEPI vs JEPQ Detailed Breakdown,"Been digging into JEPI and JEPQ the past few days since they’re some of the most talked about covered call ETFs right now. Both kick out high yields, but once looking closer, they’re built pretty differently.

I built a hypothetical portfolio in Dividend Watch to run some numbers that my broker doesn't really provide, and there are some interesting takes.

On yield alone, JEPQ looks like the winner. It’s paying around 10.7% right now ($6.08/share annually), compared to JEPI at about 8.4% ($4.78/share). But the payout history flips the story a bit. JEPI’s income has been trending down. It was paying $6.36 back in 2022 and it’s tracking closer to $3.21 so far this year. JEPQ’s gone the other direction, climbing from $3.85 in 2022 to a little over $6 annually today. So JEPI feels like it’s slipping, while JEPQ’s been showing some growth.

The portfolios explain a lot of the difference. JEPI spreads things out: tech is the biggest slice at about 20%, but healthcare, financials, and industrials are all in that same ballpark. It feels more balanced, like a fund designed not to swing too wildly if one sector struggles. JEPQ is basically a concentrated Nasdaq income play. Over half of it is tech, and then another 30% is tied up in communication services and consumer cyclical. If tech’s hot, you’re golden. If not, you’re going to feel it.

So the trade-off seems pretty clear:

* JEPI = diversified and steadier, but the shrinking payouts raise questions.
* JEPQ = higher yield and actual dividend growth, but it’s a much bigger bet on tech.

I can see the case for holding both, but personally I’m leaning toward JEPQ if I’m chasing income and JEPI if I want something a little less tied to Nasdaq performance.

1nk4xlt,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 06:47:19,Dividend Growth vs High Yield — Are We Underestimating the Long-Term Power of Yield on Cost?,"Lately, I've been running long-term projections comparing dividend growth strategies with high-yield income plays, and I keep hitting an interesting paradox. Most people warn against chasing high yields, saying it's better to focus on companies with lower current yields but strong dividend growth.

But when I model this using yield on cost  and reinvested dividends, compounding from even modest growth rates completely flips the script over multi-decade timeframes.

Here's what I keep seeing:

\-High-growth dividend stocks (7–10% CAGR) usually start at 1–2% yield and trade at rich multiples.

\-High-yield stocks (6–9%) usually have flat or zero growth, but give me immediate cash to reinvest elsewhere.

\-Assuming full reinvestment, the closest point in my models between these two strategies is often around years 12–15.

So my core question is:

Are we underestimating the long-term power of YOC and dividend growth compounding, or overestimating the risk of high-yield sustainability?

I’d love to hear from other dividend-focused investors:

\-How do you model this trade-off between current yield and future dividend growth?

\-Does anyone currently run long-term (20+ years) backtests comparing DGI vs high yield portfolios?

I-s a “hybrid” portfolio (3–4% initial yield + 5–6% growth) the sweet spot, or just a compromise that underperforms both?

They have been paying these dividends for well over a decade with no lapses in payments. Consistent as a clock.

$50,000 in GUT would earn you roughly $500/month.

1njrc0k,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 18:29:32,"Is this etf allocation the safest, provides the highest monthly yeild, and with limited to no NAV erosion?","I will keep it brief. It is very hard to find the optimal etf mix that pays monthly dividends, limited to no NAV erosion, and pays a high yeild. 

By thier nature, covered call strategies lag the market in high volatility months, and that's what makes them lose their NAV value in the long term.

Dividends etfs have quality holdings, but all have poor yeilds (IDVO and DIVO mix are the highest yeild that pay monthly, yet they are still very low considering 30% tax on the dividends for people in my situation).

Thus, I present the below allocation as this etf allocation, in my view, is the safest, provides the highest monthly yeild, and with limited to no NAV erosion:

- HIGH 50% (80% of NAV is in treasury bills, the strategy uses options to increase the yeild) - yeild is around 7%
- SBAR 25% (barrier strategy, set at 30% below the market price on the put option date, the risk of breaking the barrier is 6% as per Simply, which is low) - yeild is around 10% 
- SPYI 12.5% (covered calls on S&P, it performed very well since Inception and expected to sustain its NAV long term) - yeild is around 11.7%
- XV 12.5% (similar strategy to SBAR, but the target yeild is 15% which is the fixed part of the equation while the barrier level is the variable, risker but worth the risk) - yeild is around 15%

The weighted average yeild is 9.3%. Even after interest rates drop to normal levels, the yeild would not be lower than 8% while half of the portfolio is in treasuries, 25% has a deep spot rate that makes it very low risk, and the rest (25%) is linked to S&P and broad market indexes (NASDAQ, S&P, and Russle 1000).

These etfs are very recently established, and we do not know how will they perform long term.

Invested about 18K and now have a projected income of 115! I been investing a lot recently so actual gains are much lower given recent investments.

My goal is to have 50 positions all with 2%  however REITS and ETF's are already diversified so likely will progress towards a 50-60 in ETF's and REITS while the rest in individual stocks each with around 2%.

TGT I thought was a great value under 100 so I loaded up higher and I really love SPG busniness which is why I went heavy with them..

It's a newer account so im not to worried about being exactly balanced, but as I build it to 100K I want to get closer and closer to it being well balance and at the correct percentages.

Recently unloaded PSEC and HRZN will be deleting them off the list for 2026 and reorganzing it better as well. Lots of additions this year so it does look a bit messy. Percentages are listed on the left side.

I am 40 so I plan on building it over the next 20 years and in that time will consider going down in hours to 32 hours and after 60 might see about even fewer hours and more PTO and days off.

Plan is to go for high divd return with SOME divd growth stocks but overall will plan on taking out max of 80% divid income and keep reinvesting 20% to keep the income growing to keep up with rising costs. but yea.

Good holdings? Bad positions? idk.. what yall think?

1nisaxv,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 16:09:31,Top 3 dividend/growth plays from my portfolio (+ 1 joker pick),"I would love to hear everybody else's answers to the 2 questions below which are two of the most common questions I get as a value/dividend investor.

1. Which are your best dividend stocks right now when you look at total growth (dividends + dividend growth + stock price appreciation)?
2. Do you DRIP?

 Here are my own answers:

The quick answer to question no. 2 is: No, I don’t DRIP. In this post I’ll focus on question no. 1, but I’ve also shared a link to an older post here where I go into detail about my dividend strategy and why I don’t DRIP.

Getting back to question no. 1: The enclosed screenshot is a snapshot from my IBKR (Interactive Brokers) account showing some of my dividend positions and how they’ve done over the past 4–5 years:

**Important note:**

1. The performance of the tickers below only reflects unrealised gains and does not include the dividends I’ve received along the way, so the actual total return is higher.
2. I have owned several of these stocks on and off during the past 24 years. The positions mentioned below have alI been initiated within the past 3-5 years, with the exception of HSBC which I have only owned since April '25. I have been adding to most of the positions below during corrections — latest in April ’25.

The following 3 have been some of my favourite Total Growth dividend stocks:

**UNM: +185% (6.5% YOC)**  
Boring old insurer, very under the radar, but valuation was low and returns have been excellent.

**ABBV: +169% (8.1% YOC)**  
Big pharma cash flow machine. Humira decline was a concern but the pipeline and new drugs have carried growth.

**SPG: +130% (8.1% YOC)**  
Class-A malls and outlets. They bounced back strong after COVID and have kept raising the dividend.

And then a joker pick outside the screenshot is **RITM**, yielding 8.0% right now. I owned it pre-pandemic and took a loss, but post-pandemic it might actually be my best performer. I re-entered at $4.33 in April ’20, and most recently added 4,000 shares at $9.77 in April ’25. The quarterly dividends are remarkable and add a lot of dry powder every three months.

RITM is a mREIT with a broad engine (MSRs, credit, servicing). It can be volatile, but the dividend has held up well. I also expect a dividend increase and/or a potential spinoff of the NewRez division, which could unlock further value for investors in 2026. RITM has also structured and hedged its business intelligently, making it less sensitive to interest rate changes.

Another great dividend-paying stock which has been winning my heart lately is HSBC. I had wanted to own it for quite a while and finally bought in on April 7th during the tariff scare at $48.36 (2.2% YOC). Since then it has gone up 43%.

**HSBC** is one of the world’s largest banks with a strong footprint in Asia, the UK, and global wealth management. Rising rates and cost discipline have boosted earnings, and capital returns have improved with consistent dividend hikes and buybacks. For me it’s a solid play with global diversification, and I see further upside as they keep simplifying the business and focusing on higher-return markets.

That’s my take. I do own several other great dividend-paying value stocks, REITs and BDCs, but that’s another story.

**I would love to hear how others here would answer those two questions:**

1. **Which dividend stocks have given you the best total growth the past few years?**
2. **And do you DRIP, or not — and why?**

Here is the link to my previous post which also includes my views on DRIP, and my dividend and reinvestment strategy:

I was looking at different bonds/funds and, among others, found this fund, so I wonder if any of you have invested into it, or how does it look to you.

***What I'm looking for***: an investment returning at least 5%. If it's a fund, it has do be distributing dividends, not accumulating them. I already have high-yield funds, so I wish to deleverage the risk a little bit.

***What I like***: they have a mix of fixed-income (~50%), stocks (~25%) and convertibles (~25%). They also have a mix between AA bonds (~25%), BBB (~20%), BB (~25%), B (~15%)

***What I don't like***: they pay a dividend and it's yielding around 8%. It seems too good to be true, as some high-yields I've seen yield around there and don't even have AA bonds. What's the catch?

Lately, I keep seeing AI investing tools claiming crazy stuff like 30% annual returns with zero effort.

Honestly, I haven’t tried any of them, because they feel more like marketing than actual investing.

I know AI can be powerful at analyzing trends better than humans, but I don’t think it’s there yet.

I like the idea behind magnifi.com what they do is speed up your research on stocks.

It won’t decide for you, but it helps you dig into information on the internet quickly and saves you time.

Other than this, I don’t trust AI to fully manage my hard-earned money.

But I also wonder: why would I pay for subscriptions when there are tons of free newsletters like Morning Brew (their investing edition)

which can give me timely analysis and cut down the time and effort I’d spend?

Personally, I like [Thevale ](https://linkly.link/2F5HO) because their analysis is 60% visual, so it’s easier for me to grasp the idea.

Let’s be honest we won’t invest in every analysis we read. That’s why I prefer their visual-first content: if I’m interested, I’ll dig deeper.

I’m curious to know how you guys feel about the future of AI, and especially how it’s being marketed.

Do you believe or trust AI to research, plan, and manage your money right now or at some point in the near future?

Or are you like me, and won’t trust it for the next few years?",0,21,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nig4bt/do_you_trust_ai_with_your_money_completely_with/,new,Discussion,0.41

1ni79i5,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 23:53:30,"You have $2,500 what to buy that will pay that back in dividends the shortest time?"," Curious on your take…

Here’s Grok’s answer:

To recover your $2,500 investment through dividends in the shortest time, prioritize investments with the highest dividend yields, as the payback period is calculated as 1 divided by the yield (expressed as a decimal), assuming dividends remain constant. This ignores factors like taxes, reinvestment, or changes in dividend payments.

Based on recent data, business development companies (BDCs) and REITs offer some of the highest yields. The top option is Prospect Capital Corp. (PSEC), with a trailing dividend yield of 20.36% as of September 6, 2025. 44 This corresponds to an annualized dividend of $0.72 per share (paid monthly at $0.06 per share). To arrive at the payback period: convert the yield to a decimal (0.2036), then divide 1 by 0.2036, resulting in approximately 4.91 years.
With $2,500, you could purchase around 920 shares at the recent price of about $2.72 per share (prices fluctuate, so confirm current pricing). Annual dividend income would be roughly $509 ($2,500 × 0.2036), recovering the principal in under 5 years if dividends hold steady.

Other high-yield alternatives include:
	•	ARMOUR Residential REIT Inc. (ARR): Yield of 19.22% as of mid-September 2025. 54 Payback period: 1 / 0.1922 ≈ 5.20 years.
	•	Horizon Technology Finance Corp. (HRZN): Yield of 19.27% as of mid-September 2025. 40 Payback period: 1 / 0.1927 ≈ 5.19 years.
	•	Oxford Square Capital Corp. (OXSQ): Yield of 19.27% as of mid-September 2025. 29 Payback period: 1 / 0.1927 ≈ 5.19 years.

For a more diversified option, consider the Invesco KBW Premium Yield Equity REIT ETF (KBWY) with a yield of 9.28% as of September 2, 2025. 11 Payback period: 1 / 0.0928 ≈ 10.78 years. This is longer but may carry lower company-specific risk.

Yields can change, and ultra-high yields often reflect higher volatility or potential dividend cuts—review the latest financials before investing.

**Big question**: Among various options like annuities, I have looked at placing a lump sum of \~$550k in PDI, the leveraged fixed income Closed End Fund from PIMCO, the Dynamic Income Fund, that yields, based on current price, 13.3% and pays monthly and has paid a similar dividend without interruption since 2012.

**Desired Outcome:** This would give us income of \~$6k per month, which meets the threshold of income we need to be able to save almost all of my earnings. Not concerned about total return, just the steady income.

I’ve had my 457b for 10 years, but I was only throwing nickels and dimes at it. I had $7,000 in it 5 years ago when I began taking my retirement seriously. 

My Roth IRA is roughly: 25% QQQ, 25% VTI, 25% VIG, 22% SCHD, less than 2% MSFT & DGRO

My Roth 457b is roughly: 53% SV-COM (state street S&P 500), 22% V0128A (MFS International blend), 8% DFFVX, 6% LMOIX, 4% ANCFX, 3% VERIX, 1% BAGSX, BGRFX, NVLIX, and PORT (empower guaranteed portfolio)

I’ve self invested my Roth IRA, and my Roth 456b is robo invested through empower. The 457b is purely growth, they don’t offer any dividend plays. My IRA I’m balancing both growth (QQQ) and dividends (the rest). I had been running a 25/25/25/25 with QQQ, VTI, VIG, and SCHD for awhile. I bought MSFT with Schwab slices to make sure I was as close to 100% invested as I could be (you can’t buy dividends on stock slices). Lately I’ve been slightly less pleased with how SCHD has been performing and have begun adding DGRO. 

In the last 5 years I’ve also been able to buy a home, travel, eat out, etc. I’ve done all of this while pulling in roughly $100k a year. 

My plan is to retire at 60 and turn my IRA into a full dividend account and never touch the nest egg as I draw down my 457b and collect my pension. My pension is small, but I don’t have to fund it at all. It should be roughly mid $30k a year based on what I make now. 

I see a ton of people posting on here with million dollar accounts and for regular people I think it’s hard to relate. I wanted to show even working class people who are consistent can live good, and make investment gains. They say your first $100k takes the longest, here’s hoping to get another $100k in less than 5.

VOO gives me exposure to the big U.S. market for growth, and SCHD brings in steady dividends from companies with strong fundamentals, like solid payout ratios and consistent earnings. It’s been a nice balance for making money and keeping some income flowing, even when the market gets wild.

But lately, I’m feeling like my portfolio’s too focused on the U.S. With inflation sticking around, global politics getting messy, and U.S. stocks looking a bit pricey, I’m thinking about diversifying to spread out my risk and maybe boost my returns. I’m looking at international ETFs like VEU (Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US) or IDEV (iShares Core MSCI International Developed Markets) to add some global flavor while still keeping dividends coming in.

I’m considering moving 20-30% of my money into something like VWO (Vanguard Emerging Markets) for a shot at higher growth, but I’m a bit worried about currency swings, so maybe a hedged option makes sense. From some quick math, this kind of shift could help my portfolio take less of a hit during rough patches, which sounds pretty good.
So, what do you all think? Any international dividend ETFs you’ve been liking lately? Got any favorites in developed or emerging markets? Are you doing anything specific, like focusing on high-quality or less volatile stocks, to manage risk? And how do you balance going global versus sticking with the U.S. market’s strength?

I’m a European investor (using Interactive Brokers) and I’m trying to build a simple dividend-focused ETF portfolio for cash flow. I’d especially love to hear from other **European dividend investors** since UCITS funds and tax treatment can be quite different from the U.S. market.

I’ve been looking at these three UCITS ETFs:

* **TDIV UCITS** – VanEck Morningstar Developed Markets Dividend Leaders
* **IDVY UCITS** – iShares Euro Dividend
* **SPYD UCITS** – SPDR S&P U.S. Dividend Aristocrats

All three ETFs are UCITS, which is important for EU investors, and together they give me exposure across global, European, and U.S. markets. They also pay dividends quarterly, and when combined, they provide income in six different months of the year: March, April, June, July, September, and October (with all three paying in December).

My goal is to build a portfolio that provides reliable cash flow without heavy NAV erosion, while maintaining diversification across regions and keeping things simple with just three funds.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on whether this 3-ETF combo makes sense for a dividend-focused EU investor, and if there are better UCITS dividend ETFs I should be considering.

For years my dream was simple: to save enough so that I could live off dividends. I finally reached that point – I’ve been investing through Tastytrade into U.S. ETFs (mainly SCHD and some VGT), and I’ve built up a serious portfolio.

I’m 27, married, with a little daughter. I always imagined dividends as the foundation of financial security for my family – stability during my life, and something I could eventually pass down.

I also considered real estate, but honestly? It’s not as attractive anymore. ROI is low, demographics in Poland are bad, and I don’t believe property prices will keep growing like they did in the past. That’s why I went all-in on stocks and dividends.

And then I discovered the U.S. estate tax rules. Here’s the painful part:

* As a non-U.S. resident, if I hold more than **$60,000 in U.S. assets (stocks/ETFs)**, my heirs could face up to **40% estate tax** when I die.
* It doesn’t matter that I live in Poland and already pay taxes here – the U.S. only cares that the securities are listed in America, so they treat them as “U.S. assets” and apply estate tax.
* With my current portfolio, I already fall into the **highest bracket: 40% estate tax**.
* And Poland has **no estate tax treaty with the U.S.**, so I’m fully exposed.

This hit me very hard. My biggest fear is that if something happens to me, my wife and daughter won’t just lose me – they could also lose almost half of what I’ve been building for years. It feels like they’d be robbed of the very security I wanted to leave them.

People often suggest UCITS ETFs in Europe as an alternative. But let me be blunt: **UCITS ETFs are terrible compared to the U.S. ones – much more expensive, worse in performance, and with far fewer choices.** For someone who spent years building a strategy around SCHD and similar funds, switching to UCITS feels like a huge downgrade.

I know there are ways around this (family foundations, trusts, private banking), but honestly? It hurts that my dream of living off dividends turned out to be so complicated.

👉 I’d especially like to hear from people who have actually dealt with this issue in real life – how did you solve it? Did you set up a trust, a foundation, or just accept the risk? I don't know.. maybe I should just sell everything and transfer money to European broker and buy nasdaq etf and wait, or maybe buy some real estate. Ehh.

I got to the point where I just wanted to go myself, but the solo cost seemed out of reach. I did the math and, almost as an afterthought, realized that the entire cost is about two months of dividends/distributions. I’ve been so disciplined about reinvesting my distributions every month that it became an essential “expense” like my condo fee or power bill. It never crossed my mind to simply collect them for a few weeks and use them for something else.

I know that sounds silly and that a lot of people pay other expenses with dividends, but for me this is when it really hit me.

If I buy 50k of ULTY, the yield rate is 134%. This means that I will be making 67k per year only in dividends. Now I consider the HIGHEST possible tax bracket which is 37%. 67,000 x 0.37 = $24,790



So, I will be getting ($67,000 - $24,790) = $42,210 in dividends per year, AFTER taxes.



Let's suppose 4 years from now, ULTY goes to zero and stops paying the dividends. I would have accumulated $42,210 x 4 = $168,840



If the ULTY dividends go to zero, become shit, become unsellable, I will still have a net profit of $168,840 - $50,000 = $118,840



That is a HUGE improvement. So what am I missing? And with the dividends I'm getting paid from ULTY, I would buy less risky stuff like QQQI, SPY, and BTC.",0,17,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nffbb4/a_possible_scenario_when_buying_ulty/,new,Brokerage,0.5

But please accept the premise and consider an answer. I.e. this is not asking whether there is a real estate bubble, and nor is it about to burst; it's about understanding REIT risk).

REITs pay very nice dividends/distributions, largely as required by law (some percentage of revenue has to be paid out in order to be a REIT with all of those benefits). When interest rates decline, dividend/income paying stocks should increase in value. 

But what if in addition to interest rates declining (and the reason for the decline), the real estate bubble bursts because of overpriced real estate, or a deep recession, business failures and defaults (commercial real estate), homeowners default because of unemployment, homeowners default because they really couldn't afford their mortgage in the first place (a la 2008), etc.

I am seeing may posts about making significant amount of money from dividends. As I understand dividend (qualified or not) is income. Being an income, even if you have reinvested it, won't you have pay income tax on it? Federal and may be state income tax. If you are in higher tax bracket, you may have to pay a significant amount as taxes. And this will repeat every year. Is my understanding correct? If so, won't it be better to invest in growth stocks and let that grow tax free till you sell it during your retirement when you may be on lower tax bracket?

1neegto,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 13:09:41,Advice Needed:,"Hey yall, wanted to run my upcoming scenario by everyone to get input! 

Background: 33M in MCOL city. I have a wife and a 5 and 2 year old. Wife makes 80K a year in a steady corporate job. Has about 60k in a 401K

I’ve been in the same Real Estate job for the last ten years and am reaching my breaking point. Very stressful and my boss (owner of the company) just simply isn’t a good person.  

I have about 120K in mutual funds but no 401K since my company is a small family run business. I’m about to quit my job and go get my Broker’s license and go out on my own in Real Estate. 

My wife is receiving a 400K inheritance at the end of this month. Income is our primary focus currently while I start my Brokerage. We need income to pay the bills until I get the Brokerage up and running. 

We own two single family homes that we rent out. One is paid in full and the other has a 140K mortgage on it and is worth about 205K. Both are rented with good long-term tenants. After all expenses (taxes, insurance, the mortgage on the one, etc) we cash-flow about 1,300 a month combined. But of course we’ve had some unexpected expensive Cap-Ex hit us recently so this can’t be relied upon. 

We sold another rental about 4 months ago and turned it into 100K in SPYI, 100K in QQQI, 10K in MSTY, and 10K in ULTY. That alone brings in about $3,600 a month at a 25% yield.

I know a 25% yield isn’t sustainable and want to bring it down closer to 10-12%. I’m okay with a little risk and not capitalizing on growth as income is currently our focus. 

We will have about 380K after taxes to invest and am considering the follow allocation: 

Realty Income (O): 100K (Feel strongly upcoming tax cuts while really help them)
AMLP: 50K
PBDC: 50K
UTG: 50K
JBB: 25K
GPIQ: 25K
GPIX: 25K
QDVO: 15K
IDVO: 15K
ARCC: 15K
EPD: 10K

Am I missing anything here? Any blind spots or sectors that I need to include to feel diversified? Appreciate your input!

What I do know is that given my portfolio I'm able to utilize dividends to not only sustain my lifestyle but also Dollar Cost Average.  So when the market tanks, and it will tank,  my portfolio will drop less than the market and to be honest I hope it drops as I'll be picking up shares on the cheap and adding to my dividend payments which will increase my take home pay and my dollar cost averaging even further.  So the reduced drawdown percentage in a downturn coupled with the Dollar Cost Averaging makes way more sense to me than just about any other approach.  When others are crying during a downturn I will be smiling, smiling smiling.......

These stocks are safe, some have dividend growth, and are a great foundation. I then use the dividends to buy options ETFs such as YM and NEOs funds. The distributions from that is what I use to pay my bills. The more bills I pay, the more money I can put into the dividend stocks. Rinse and repeat. I call this the anchor approach. It will take more time and money, but in the event of a massive recession like 08, my anchor (dividends and BDCs) will survive and continue producing. Even if the options get destroyed, they helped massively increase my dividend portfolio and hopefully had a great total return.

1neajyj,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 10:37:34,BITO Chat GBT vs GROK,"
I see that these 2 AI models have different views about what happens to BITO dividend if bitcoin doubles in price. Chat gbt originally claimed that even though BITO price could double the dividend dollar amount would be the same (so the percentage yield would drop to say 25%). GROK disagreed and expected the dividend amount to increase substantially even by 100%. So I put GROK into Chat GBT to see what it had to say to defend itself with the result below. My takeaway is if you believe the rosy scenarios painted for bitcoin it’s better to stock up now to capture the maximum $ dividend amounts rather than buying progressively as the prices rise. 


⸻

✅ Interpretation
	•	Now: With BITO at ~$20 and annual dividends around $10.60, the yield looks huge (~53%).
	•	Future A (Favorable): If Bitcoin doubles and BITO’s dividends scale proportionally, both price and payout double → yield stays the same (~53%).
	•	Future B (Less favorable): If roll costs or falling interest rates cap dividend growth, the payout rises only ~25% → yield drops (~33%).

So the key takeaway:
	•	If Grok’s view holds (Scenario A), your per-share dividend does double with Bitcoin.
	•	If my more cautious view (Scenario B) holds, distributions increase but more slowly, and yield % falls.

👉 Would you like me to extend this with a sensitivity table (showing multiple Bitcoin price increases, not just a doubling) so you can see how dividends might behave across a range of outcomes?",0,4,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1neajyj/bito_chat_gbt_vs_grok/,new,Discussion,0.33

1ndsj8j,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 18:41:03,How Northwest Healthcare's Dividend Slash Is Hitting Retail Investors Hard,"Hey r/dividends,

The recent dividend cut by Northwest Healthcare Properties REIT (NWH.UN) from $0.06667 to $0.03 per unit monthly has sent shockwaves through the investor community, especially for those relying on its income stream. With a hefty $3.65 billion debt load and rising interest rates squeezing their finances, NWH's move to slash dividends has left many retail investors frustrated and rethinking their positions.

From what I've seen on Reddit and other forums, the sentiment is pretty sour—some are disappointed about losing reliable passive income, while others are questioning the REIT's long-term stability, especially after its stock has tanked nearly 50% over the past decade. The sale of their UK portfolio and other assets raises more questions about future cash flow and whether the dividend will ever recover.

For those holding NWH.UN or eyeing healthcare REITs, what’s your take? Are you sticking it out, or is this a sign to pivot to other income-focused investments? How are you navigating REITs in this high-interest-rate environment?

1ndl3kk,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 13:45:05,Dividend income and total return are NOT always interchangeable,"I keep trying to have a useful discussion about dividend income during retirement, and every time, across multiple subs, it’s derailed by people saying to ignore dividends and focus on total return, because they’re effectively the same. This has even happened on this sub, where I wrongly assumed people would see through such a misunderstanding.

Either these people are wrong, or I’m misunderstanding something very fundamental. So, let’s have it out. I’ll make my argument, and people can tell me where I’m wrong, and I’ll either walk away having learned my lesson, or finally conclude that most people are just confused on this issue.

First, I want to acknowledge where I think people who make this argument are coming from and agree that they have a point in certain scenarios.

Let’s say I have two stocks, KO and Example Corp. (EXAM). KO pays a reliable dividend and EXAM doesn’t pay a dividend. Assume I’m in a tax-advantaged account, and nearing retirement but not actually in it, so we’ll ignore the tax implications for now. If EXAM and KO (including DRIP) both gain 25% in one year, it’s true that in many ways the dividend doesn’t matter. I’m still 25% richer from either one, and I can sell either stock just as easily. As I understand it, this is the point people are making when they say total return and dividends are interchangeable, so just focus on total return. In this scenario, I agree that they are interchangeable.

However, there are many scenarios where dividend income and total return have extremely different properties, and this matters a lot, and *that is the entire point of dividends*.

A personal finance example illustrates the point. Imagine you got hired for a job, and they agreed to pay you $100,000 a year. You eagerly await your first paycheck, and it never arrives. You complain to HR, and they explain, “Oh, at this company, we don’t pay in a consistent, predictable way like other companies. We pay you in random amounts at unexpected intervals. Some days you may receive a check for $4.63, some days you get a check for $7080.21, and some days you get nothing. But, we promise, by the end of the year, you’ll receive a total of $100,000.”

Very few people would continue working at such a place, because *consistency and predictability of cash flow is extremely important*. Many people couldn’t pay their bills that situation.

When you retire, your portfolio becomes your paycheck, so the cash flow you draw from it matters. Yes, there are many strategies for making the income smooth and predictable, and dividend payments are only one strategy. However, dividends, at least from reliable companies, have a different risk profile than other strategies, and this gives them different advantages and disadvantages.

Among highly reliable companies (say, the Dividend Aristocrats or Dividend Kings), the following is true:

1. It has never happened that half the companies in these lists suddenly quit paying dividends. Some do quit paying dividends, but it’s on the order of 1-2% on any given year.
2. It has never happened that the majority of the companies in these lists reduce their dividends dramatically in a short period of time. In fact, all of them have increased their dividends for 25 years straight, including through the 2008 recession.
3. Even if the market value of the companies gets cut in half, you still get your full dividends.
4. Over the long term, both the dividend payouts and the market value of the companies tends to grow at a rate that exceeds inflation. Therefore, if you never sell any shares, it is extremely unlikely your portfolio value will ever fall to $0.

In other words, the risk that my dividend income will go away or dramatically shrink is very low. This has been true over many decades and though many recessions.

In contrast, the following is true of the stock market in general:

1. It may dramatically (25-50%) drop in value at any time and take years to recover.
2. You may have to sell stocks while the market is down, compounding your losses.
3. If you miscalculate your safe withdrawal rate (SWR), perhaps because of a bad market early on in your retirement, you may go broke before you die.

I understand that there are ways to mitigate risk on the total return side (e.g., mixing in bonds). I agree that they are pretty good and I plan to also use them during retirement. However, they have a different risk profile. I work in risk management, and have a master’s in the subject, and different risk profiles matter, a lot.

Put simply, with dividend paying companies, your primary risk is mismanagement by leadership. With total return, your primary risk is market timing. These are not the same.

While dividend income can always be treated as total returns, total returns cannot always be treated as income without potentially locking in big losses. In other words, the interchangeability only reliably goes one way.

Large companies understand this, and that’s why they pay dividends despite the tax disadvantages. Institutional investors understand this, and that’s why they demand dividends despite the tax disadvantages. Every investor should understand this, so they can make an informed decision about which risks they are most comfortable taking.

Ok fair warning this post might be a little long but that’s only because I’m telling you my current situation and I’ll do my best to keep it in order. So I’m 33 years old, I work part time for a physical therapy office as an aide. I also go to school part time finishing my associates degree in liberal arts but plan on going into the radiology technologist program after i graduate. The program itself is full time only 8am-4pm and 2 years long. Meaning while I’m in the program I can’t really work while in the program other than working the 5 hour Saturday shift my job has. 

 I have a savings account that I don’t have access to until my mom passes on that has $40k in it. This is my emergency savings account that I got when I was a minor thinking that I’d have access to the money when I came of age turns out that’s not the case. So that’s in the background for later on in life.

Now onto the money. I’ve been working at my job for 6 years, I have a 403b plan with employer matching, as of last year I started putting the money in the Roth 403b (same account just now it’s being taxed). I also switched it over a little over a month ago from the target date fund, to the s&p500 fund for better gains but sadly my 403b doesn’t earn any dividends. I have 10% being taken out per check going to this. In total my 403b is worth $44,014 as of the time of this post. 

Last year I opened up my Roth IRA in mid July 2024, and started putting $120/ check into it. I have my Roth with vanguard. My primary focus, given that Vanguard doesn’t offer fractional shares other than with Vanguard products, is that I would put as much of the $120 into SCHD that I could buy and then any money that’s leftover I put into VOO. Currently I have been able to consistently buy 4 shares of SCHD and about 0.01/0.02 shares of VOO. I have just recently sporadically been buying shares of SCHG here and there. Currently I have:

SCHD shares 156.424 ($4,292.27)
VOO shares 2.422 ($1,444.72)
SCHG shares 20.004 ($619.92)

For a total of $6,357.32

My goal is to buy and hold forever and live off of the dividends, hense SCHD being my primary focus. But this is my dilemma, lately I’ve been reading peoples posts on here about focusing on growth and then transfer to dividends later. My position in SCHD has finally gotten to the point where the quarterly dividends are large enough that it can buy 1 full share of the ETF when I get them. I don’t know if I should continue to invest primarily in SCHD as my focus since once i eventually get into the radiology program (which should hopefully be next year) I won’t be working as much and if I should focus on getting those dividends as large as possible to carry the weight for when I have to stop contributing for 2 years. Or should I switch over to SCHG as my focus and have the leftovers go into VOO since I’ll be missing out on growth and I can switch it over to SCHD later on in life? My ideal goal would be to life off of $100,000 in annual dividends, but I know I’d need like $2.5M in SCHD to get even close to that. 

So I’m hoping that by the time I retire, with the money in my 403b, the savings account I don’t have access to yet, social security, and my Roth IRA that all of that combined will be enough that I can retire comfortably even if it’s not $100,000 in annual dividends. 

What are your guys thoughts on my current situation? What would you do if you were put in my situation? Should I continue DCA in SCHD with leftovers into VOO or should I switch my focus to SCHG? Also keep in mind that once i eventually become a radiology technologist I’ll be making more money and I can afford to contribute more later on, hopefully enough to make up for the 2 year gap that I missed out on.

I recently sold a rental property, but still have 2 others. I want to generate a robust income stream that will grow over time. My 2 rentals and two other private equity investments (hard money lending and real estate development loan) cover just about all of my expenses. I also have some funds in 401k that I’m not touching yet but they are there as an emergency break the glass type option. So I’m mostly trying to generate an income stream, get comfortable with it and potentially sell 1-2 of my rentals down the line and allocate money  similarly. Here are my allocations currently: 

MLPs: 15% total

My thinking is that if there is a pullback and my portfolio is well diversified enough (and has some cash or bonds on the side) I would still have room to buy the dip. What are some investments that I could add that are not strongly correlated to what I already have ? I was thinking about gold but that doesn’t pay a dividend (unless using a CC fund). Also considering CEFS (the etf) and FSCO ? Or other safer ways to invest in credit? I would love to hear some feedback.

1ncmd84,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 11:41:59,Correct my train of thought - using qqqi to park cash instead of a 4% money market for higher yield,"Background - all set on other investments, no debt, etc etc.

Have $70k sitting in a cash account making 4%.  This isn't earmarked for emergency or retirement. Maybe something in the middle - if I casually come across a piece of property or want a shiny new toy

Came across qqqi and thought it might be a good alternative.  The idea is that the principal could still be liquidated for a larger purchase, but in the meantime have it cashflow a few more bucks to enjoy guilt free hobbies/weekend getaways.

I 100% get the price of qqqi falling so I'd be exposed to that - but rationally I just wouldn't sell at that time ( maybe buy more?)

My napkin math says it should pay 3x what I'm making on the cash account after taxes and fees.

So first - is the math correct?

Am I correct in saying if I paid $53/share and a year later I sell at $53 a share - thats a wash ( no tax implications) and really no different that pulling out my principal, just like I would on the money market account?

Am I missing anything ( like is the tax situation better or worse than what I'm thinking?

Better alternatives?

napkin math on $70k

|Investment|Gross Monthly|After-Tax Monthly (est.)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Money Market (4%)|$233|**$177**|
|QQQI ETF (\~14% yield)|$817|**$590**|

Edit : Re-highlighting this cash isn't set aside for emergencies - I have a separate account with 2 years expenses already filled for that.  I guess if there was an emergency with a greater need, I'd probably be tapping in to more buckets than just this one.

  
Edit 2: Decided on putting $25k in to QQI - figured that can get me close to the current dividends of the entire $70k the money market ( about $200 /month) , and will look in to some of the other suggestions to place the remaining $45k :-) I agree with spreading it out a bit or even holding it in cash longer for a deal to come up.

1ncljm0,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 11:10:38,JEPI vs GPIX maybe SPYI,"I’ve been following this thread for a while, and the more I learn, the more I realize how much I don’t know.

First: I’ve noticed a big divide when it comes to MSTY. Some people point out the steady NAV decline, while others don’t seem to care as long as their dividend income outweighs their initial cash outlay.

Second: A lot of people here seem to like JEPI. I was considering it for a portfolio I’m building, but when I looked at the NAV chart, it honestly left me a little discouraged.

Third: I recently came across GPIX. It looks like it has a lower expense ratio and a different mix of assets compared to JEPI. It seems like GPIX is at least trying to preserve NAV, though maybe it’s not as defensive. SPYI might be another option too.

What do you all think? 
Maybe if you’re in this position, share your portfolio design? This person has income from residential real estate, so I wasn’t planning any REITs.  These investments would be in an IRA for a 72yr old facing RMDs soon. He doesn’t really need the income (gets nervous if net worth declines), but I was hoping the RMDs would encourage him to start living a more plentiful life. I.e. a new truck, a vacation, or maybe even a steak that’s not from the expired section of the cooler!

5% VPU  or XLU

5% XLE or DBC

This hasn’t been a very loved named, and has historically traded at a discount to the HPC peers. It’s a target of a few activist fights, and management is relatively green. Back to this newer news, doesn’t a ~15% move downward seem like a lot for a brand that makes up only about 10% of revenue. And that’s for the entire population that regularly uses it, not just pregnant women. 

It doesn’t help that the science is shoddy and apparently there is no consensus among the scientific community that acetaminophen taken during pregnancy has any impact on pregnancy. Even if it does have grounding, what kind of liability would this even present?

I feel like it’s de-risked enough to be worth a lick at these levels. A lot of research reports have been published reiterating buys, with maybe slight downside to price target. It’s a leading HPC with $36B in cap, $15B in revenue, and they essentially have a top brand in every category they’re in (skincare, mouthwash, bandage, nicotine patch).

1nc2jsx,2025-09-08,2025-09-08 18:55:05,Ideas on changing my Dividend strategy,"Ok, this is a bit of an odd post for me, but I would like to hear some opinions about this before I try this out. 

To preface, I have a portfolio with about 30 stocks in it. Most are stable div stocks, some are volatile growth, and a few are terrible no good YM stocks. Today I would like to talk about those few...

I have around 10k sitting in this account. Around 2k sits in YM stocks. From that, about $600ish is in ulty.

We've been around for a while, we have seen that ulty drops constantly, however I am a dog and I want the weekly(incredibly volatile) div. My only problem is the constant loss. I don't mind a loss, but I feel like there is a better way to manage it. That brings me to my next part.

Why not just buy some shares before the ex div date, drip the div, and sell afterwards, holding whatever amount of shares afterwards. My very own modification of the dividend capture strategy. That way I can miss out on some of the weekly decline.

I understand that dividend capture is quite risky so I want to find other strategies or experienced opinions before I try it.

I want people to tell me it's bad, or good(not). But I also want to hear you opinion on WHY its bad or good. I also want to know what I should be doing instead.

Post note: Yes I fully understand that YM etfs are not sustainable. No, I don't plan on keeping them long term. I am looking to grow the position and drip into more stable etfs in my portfolio (voo, schd, schg, spyi) until they fizzle out of existence.

I'm looking for the best way to keep track of my investments. I don't use an app or spread sheet to do this but it seems that most people do. I realize I have essentially been ""winging it"", and want to become more responsible/informed now that I have the habit down. 

Does anyone have an app they love or way to set up an excel spreadsheet? Is there a way to hook up my investment app (I know I'll get hate for this but I use Robinhood) to a tracker app to do it automatically? Looking to track growth progress as well as dividends (the dopamine hit from dividend investments really keeps me motivated). 

I'm hoping once I get a better layout of viewing my progress I can go from there to better keep track of things and make smarter moves. I want to become a better informed investor.

Since I have been invested in the for the past few years they have treated every dividend payout as a return of capital which I understand reduces my basis.  A few questions about this:

1) This position is in a taxable brokerage Fidelity account and I don’t see my costs basis reducing after each dividend.  Am I supposed to track the reduced basis myself?

2) The share price of this stock has moved between $3 and $6.  To make the math easy if this $0.10 quarterly dividend continues for 10 years and my purchase price was $4 how does Fidelity know to reclassify as income and not a return of capital when my basis theoretically reduces to $0?

1nbbgbj,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 22:02:13,Pay Yourself in STOCKS instead of JUST a Paycheck!,"I came up with this awesome way to get me motivated to go into work and to invest! 

  
Each day I go into work I track my days and then I invest one share of a dividend income stock.  Right now it costs about 27 bucks for the share, it pays quarterly, however  I track it via monthly income so 8.5 cents it pays.  So for 5 days I build 42.5 cents of income that is monthly going to come back to me every single month in the future! 

  
Also I go to the gym 4 days a week typically.  So long as  go each visit I allow myself 1/2 share of stock as well so that is another 2 shares of stock so another 17 cents. So that is 59.5 cents each week I am building in endless income! 

  
52x59.5 thats 3,094 pennies or 30.94 x 10 years thats 309.4 or 618.8 for 20 years! 

  
Yes, im turning 40 this year and had I been doing this I would have been making... lets say 600 bucks ( accounting for days  I didn't work or what)  by now doing that alone!!!! I wish I understood this when I was 20 years old just starting! If you are in your 20's consider somthing like this that motivates you to keep going and building your wealth.  

  
I mean 600 bucks isn't tons to retire on but if I was in between jobs  and had 600 monthly income going 2 months without work wouldn't be a sweat at all provided I still have a nest egg of an emergency fund but yea.. 

I am also planning buying another stock one per day that costs around 5 buck but pays out 4 cents in monthly income.  If I don't buy anything for lunch and instead pack a lunch which is cheaper than buying stuff at work then I can buy another ONE share per week.  so that would help me stay motivated to eat cheaper lunches and invest another 20 cents  a week as well. 

I still do invest all my left over monthly cash into stocks to build that divd income but for those two stocks I am not going to invest in and the only way I can get more is by ""earning them"" from these rules. 

  
May seem unnessary but it is a great way to motivate me and keep me on track at work, gym, and on lunch!  Thought it be good to share as it might help others become motivated as well and change it as they like...

  
Happy investing everyone.  I just wish I beeen doing this all along! ugh.. We really need to be telling people JUST starting out how to REALLY build wealth like this and with such simple easy steps it can be life changing I mean if I was doing this at age 20 I would have stayed on track with my diet, health and work balance and mindset so much better.. but hey, at least im starting now.

E.g. some people advise APPL with a 0.43% dividend yield for dividend appreciation (I think it has 14 years of increasing dividend). But as an investor interested in dividends, I wouldn't buy APPL now for dividend appreciation; nice adder but not the specific factor for me to buy it now. FDVV has NVDA as its top holding (with 0.02% yield) as well as sub 1% yields for 4 of its top 5 holdings - juicing or specifically good dividend picks? (and yes, I understand div reinvestment keeps accumulating more shares, more dividends). 

As one commenter said on one of my posts: ""I suggest spending some time to understand what dividend investing really means. Buying some dividend investments doesn't automatically make you a dividend investor.""

The same could be said for several other covered call ETFs that pay extraordinarily high div rates, such as MSTY. If you are looking at taking a crazy 50% or higher dividend in cash and *also* expecting the NAV to keep up with the underlying or stay flat - you need to consider reinvesting the div or just avoid these types of ETFs altogether.

1nasxhg,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 09:16:37,Dividend Portfolio 2025 – Should I stay with income focus or switch to growth?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve recently started building a dividend-focused portfolio and I’d love to get some feedback.

# My Goals

* Preserve and grow capital (I don’t want erosion)
* Generate consistent monthly income (like a “salary”)
* Reinvest all dividends until mid-2026
* Long-term wealth growth, but I’m not sure if my allocation is right

Current portfolio (about 21K ):

* SCHD – 162.99 shares (\~$4,505)
* JEPI – 74.63 shares (\~$4,237)
* JEPQ – 20.26 shares (\~$1,130)
* SPYI – 42.88 shares (\~$2,214)
* QQQI – 44.36 shares (\~$2,359)
* IYRI – 35.37 shares (\~$1,799)
* O – 28.21 shares (\~$1,666)
* STAG – 41.93 shares (\~$1,551)
* LTC – 43.50 shares (\~$1,593)

💵 Current dividends: about **$110-130/month**  
💵 Plan: I’m adding **$6K per month until May 2026** (around $54K more).

# My Dilemma

* Should I keep this income-heavy allocation?
* Or move towards more **growth exposure (maybe 60% covered call, 40% growth)?**
   * For growth I’m considering **Microsoft, Google, Meta**.
* My worry: am I **missing the train** if I stay too dividend-focused?
* Is it smarter to just go full growth now and switch to dividends later?

I’m still learning and don’t feel I have enough knowledge yet, so your thoughts would mean a lot 🙏

Thanks in advance!

1nasiyw,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 08:57:53,Low Volatility Distribution Sample,"I’ve seen alot of posts about chasing 15% distributions while avoiding too much instability. 

As a result, I’d like to share my sample portfolio. 

1. No Nasdaq related funds. It’s great for returns but the goal is minimal volatility. No bitcoin either. 

2. derivatives funds only being used. Obviously this alone makes it risky, but this is a narrow concept sample. I’d personally never have this portfolio as I love traditional ETFs too much 



A. DIVO - 25%

- this is the safest derivative ETF with the best all time charts. Consistent growth. Consistent distributions. It has gone through many many years of market movements. 

It has a fantastic selection criteria for its underlying stocks. And their precise and particular options writing focuses on best opportunities at the present and not a blanket approach. 

B. JEPI - 20%

- The largest AUM of all derivatives ETFs. JEPI has a strict selection of low volatility strong financials, usually holding around 100-120 underlying stocks. The downside is the growth on recoveries can be tough, but as shown during COVID, it weathers downturns amazingly. 

I love this once again due to the underlying selection process. Strong financials, blue chips. 

C. GPIX - 15%

- Holds the SP500 giving broader market exposure. Helps diversify your overall holdings. However this fund purposely tries to leave room for growth and not chase high distributions. This makes it excellent for long term holding into old age because of the growth it gives room for. 

I think this fund is fantastic. It delivers between 8-9% but still has every chart green. Sleeper etf. Should be bigger than it is. 

D. IDVO - 15%

- see DIVO above. Shorter history but similar fundamentals while holding international underlying strong stocks. Helps to further diversify. 

E. SPYI - 12.5%

- see GPIX, but focuses more on distribution total versus growth. This one is not going to give you much NAV at all. Its focus is on pay outs. As we are all hoping for income, this helps to amplify our total in the short term. It’s my dopamine hit. 

F. WTPI - 12.5%

- Cash Collateral and Puts on SPY (SP500). This one holds US treasury bills while doing short puts on SPY. 

This is actually one of my favorite investment products overall. Super low volatility with strong distribution percentages. It’s up 32% since 2017, so it has growth, even if minimal, NAV growth is so important for financial freedom. 


——

There you have it. This is my version of “safe” (it’s not that safe. Covered calls are inherently riskier than traditional dividend paying ETFs). 

I have purposely left JEPQ, GPIQ, and QQQI out (I hold these in my actual portfolio but they’re riskier and tied more volatility). 

Feel free to comment, leave criticism, ignore completely or roll your eyes. 

If there are any other safe derivative ETFs please feel free to share. 

Note that I thing green NAV is the most important part of these. So if you show me something that has great distributions but -25% in its lifetime, I will roll my eyes at you.

1nas8vn,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 08:44:54,My plan for the future,"Hello guys! Im 21 and i want to start investing. I've been learning for a year and i feel the confidence in myself. I decided to go for a dividend portfolio, with copmanies that has a worldwide presence, like mcd, nke, sbux, v, ect. and the reason is that i don't want my portfolio to be restricted only to one region or county. I have find these companies that have worldwide presence: mcd, nke, sbux, ko, pep, pg, cl, mkc, jnj, abt, abbv, mdt, novob, novn, azn, rog, msft, aapl, v, ma, orcl, blk, acn, cat, etn, emr, cvx, xom, adm, de, nesn, una, or, sie, sap, muv2, tte, hen, dge, bn(danone), txn. I want my portfolio to built around these companies but i don't mind buying dividend aristocrats from the us, i just want these to be in the focus. I study in a university and working in my family's restaurant, so i can invest 200-300€ per month, which is 50-75€ weekly. I might make more, but i also want to have a safe fund, which is around 4000-5000€, it's 6-8 months of living in my country. Im still living with my family, so i don't really need it now, but if i move in the next 3-4 years it might help me out. And also want to save for a car, and want to go out with my girlfried, so i don't want to invest all my earned money, but the half or 60% of it i do. So this is my plan. I made up my rules which is if a company have belove 3% of dividend, then it have to increse it atleast 6% a year, if it's above then it should increase atleast 4% a year. Their payout ratio should be under 70%. This is what i planed. At the moment i have this portfolio i uploaded. If anyone have any suggestion or idea what should i change on my plan, or how should i make it better, i would really appreciate your opinions or help.",11,7,0,dividends,reddit,https://i.redd.it/or4kpu4rnqnf1.jpeg,new,Opinion,0.88

The monthly dividend income from SPYI is obviously more than what the Pension Plan would pay out. I'm still quite some ways out of retirement, so I am able to see SPYI performance going forward for a couple of years before pulling the trigger.

I could do Roth conversions instead, but it means waiting for five years in order to receive monthly benefits... So, I think it's not an option.

And now that it’s September and we r getting into autumn and winter it’s time to hit the gym and bulk up with some good protein. I’m thinking of getting some HRL at the current $25 level. Here’s the elevator pitch……
1.) it’s a dividend king (50+ years of increasing dividends, it has paid an uninterrupted dividend since 1928)
2.) 4.5% dividend yield that is securely covered by earnings and FCF that should continue to grow annually
3.) SPAM has a large established global presence is growing in several key Asian countries. 
4.) Last quarters results I believe was a “kitchen sink” quarter given by the former and current interim CEO. They will put in modest price increases (that I think they can pass thru to consumers) to protect margins. Thus, I believe earnings will be better than the companies guide. 
5.) As mentioned earlier…. Cutting season is over because pool/beach season is over. It’s time to lift weight and get swole brah. So lift heavy and feed those working muscles with delicious applegate meats, hormel Mac and cheese, hormel meats, planters peanuts, Spam and others!
6.) So in conclusion…buy HRL at $25 and less. Collect rising dividends, use dividends to buy hormel proteins, lift weights, eat hormel proteins which makes muscles grow and repeat until desired bulk. BOOM that’s some DD!!!

Ohh and I don’t know if I have to say this legally but disclaimer: I am an investing enthusiast but I am not a financial nor investing professional. Do ur own DD.

I’m looking for some help on how to allocate my 401k. Right now, everything is sitting in **American Funds 2060 Target Date Fund (R6)**, but I want to make sure I’m not just defaulting to that without considering other options.

Here are the funds available to me:

**Bonds**

* Prudential Stable Value Fund
* JPMorgan Core Plus Bond R6
* PIMCO Income Instl
* Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Adm

**Large-Cap Stocks**

* ClearBridge Large Cap Value I
* Vanguard Institutional Index I
* AB US Large Cap Growth L

* Wilmington Trust MFS Mid Cap Value Class 2W
* Principal Mid Cap Equity Tier IV
* Vanguard Mid Cap Index I
* Wilmington Trust Franklin Small Cap Value Class R
* Fidelity Small Cap Index
* Invesco Discovery R6
* Cohen & Steers Real Estate Securities Z

**International Stocks**

* Fidelity International Index
* MFS International Diversification R6
* Vanguard International Value Inv

**Other / Balanced / Target Date**

* Janus Henderson Balanced T
* American Funds Target Date series (2010–2065)

**Current balance:** $3,763 (100% in American Funds 2060 R6)

**About me:**

* Age: 30
* Time horizon: I plan to retire around 2060–2065, so I’ve got a long runway.

**Question:**  
Given the fund lineup, should I just stay in the 2060 Target Date fund, or would it make more sense to build my own allocation using the Vanguard Institutional Index (S&P 500), Fidelity Small Cap Index, Vanguard International Index, and maybe the Vanguard Bond Index?

VYM is heavy into financials, which bothers me at the moment, but schd is heavy into energy which really bothers me at the moment (downturn/recession, geopolitical eg opec+, Russia potentially flooding market, US production, EU and others with renewables).

I’ve had my 457b for 10 years, but I was only throwing nickels and dimes at it. I had $7,000 in it 5 years ago when I began taking my retirement seriously. 

My Roth IRA is roughly: 25% QQQ, 25% VTI, 25% VIG, 22% SCHD, less than 2% MSFT & DGRO

My Roth 457b is roughly: 53% SV-COM (state street S&P 500), 22% V0128A (MFS International blend), 8% DFFVX, 6% LMOIX, 4% ANCFX, 3% VERIX, 1% BAGSX, BGRFX, NVLIX, and PORT (empower guaranteed portfolio)

I’ve self invested my Roth IRA, and my Roth 456b is robo invested through empower. The 457b is purely growth, they don’t offer any dividend plays. My IRA I’m balancing both growth (QQQ) and dividends (the rest). I had been running a 25/25/25/25 with QQQ, VTI, VIG, and SCHD for awhile. I bought MSFT with Schwab slices to make sure I was as close to 100% invested as I could be (you can’t buy dividends on stock slices). Lately I’ve been slightly less pleased with how SCHD has been performing and have begun adding DGRO. 

In the last 5 years I’ve also been able to buy a home, travel, eat out, etc. I’ve done all of this while pulling in roughly $100k a year. 

My plan is to retire at 60 and turn my IRA into a full dividend account and never touch the nest egg as I draw down my 457b and collect my pension. My pension is small, but I don’t have to fund it at all. It should be roughly mid $30k a year based on what I make now. 

I see a ton of people posting on here with million dollar accounts and for regular people I think it’s hard to relate. I wanted to show even working class people who are consistent can live good, and make investment gains. They say your first $100k takes the longest, here’s hoping to get another $100k in less than 5.

1nlpty5,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 01:28:52,Retired. Tired of the 4% rule. I just dumped my entire portfolio into 60% SCHD 40% SCHY. I want to set and forget it forever like a trust fund.,"TLDR: Didn’t like how much I still had to manage with the traditional FIRE portfolio. Want my income to truly be passive. Dumped VTI/VEU for SCHD/SCHY. (Both US and Int’l index fund pairs). Will instruct my brokerage to disallow access to my portfolio.

—

Long story long, I was realizing that for the last six years, I was stressing myself out doing research on withdrawal methods, withdrawal rates, how to adjust withdrawals in an up market and the down market and learning about all of those methodologies, asset, allocation, bonds, sequence of withdrawal risk, etc. Every time I did research, I wanted to tinker and adjust my portfolio based on a new philosophy, and I’m getting really tired of it.

I have to open my portfolio every time I want to sell my stocks to make a withdrawal and that just encourages me to tinker. It’s just my personality. I can’t do anything about it. This also encouraged me to react to the market because I could see my entire network going up and down every time I open my portfolio.

A few days ago I literally just dumped my entire portfolio into two dividend ETFs because I am realizing how much I value simplicity and I want to set up my investments like basically a set it and forget it trustfund that pays me every month. I will also be instructing my brokerage to not allow me to have online access unless I go into a physical brokerage to make it harder for me to trade. Especially seeing as I live outside of the United States and I would have to take a flight back to place a trade or adjust my portfolio.

I’m sort of looking at this like a trust fund that is being managed by the corporations who choose to pay me dividends and they adjust how much they pay me in the markets and the markets based on the health of their companies and the economy.

I wanted a simple US dividend fund and a simple international dividend fund. I tried to wait the allocation roughly with the weight of VT (total world market fund) so it’s about 60/40.

Thoughts? Knowing I want to keep things simple and tinker free. Anything inherently wrong with this? I know I could probably diversify into different sectors and this and that but again I really don’t want to do any more research. 

I just want my money to work for me and give me passive income. It’s the whole reason I wanted to save money so I never have to think about it again. 

Portfolio size is….substantial. Schwab investment income puts it at roughly $27,000/ month (before tax) and I would be okay with dividends getting cut in half for a bit so long as I know I won’t go to zero and that the income will eventually recover. Im not adding this to brag but to give context. I probably spend like $10k/month on myself. The rest goes into savings for fun spending. So in down years I would just cut down on some of the fun and luxury.

1nbbgbj,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 22:02:13,Pay Yourself in STOCKS instead of JUST a Paycheck!,"I came up with this awesome way to get me motivated to go into work and to invest! 

  
Each day I go into work I track my days and then I invest one share of a dividend income stock.  Right now it costs about 27 bucks for the share, it pays quarterly, however  I track it via monthly income so 8.5 cents it pays.  So for 5 days I build 42.5 cents of income that is monthly going to come back to me every single month in the future! 

  
Also I go to the gym 4 days a week typically.  So long as  go each visit I allow myself 1/2 share of stock as well so that is another 2 shares of stock so another 17 cents. So that is 59.5 cents each week I am building in endless income! 

  
52x59.5 thats 3,094 pennies or 30.94 x 10 years thats 309.4 or 618.8 for 20 years! 

  
Yes, im turning 40 this year and had I been doing this I would have been making... lets say 600 bucks ( accounting for days  I didn't work or what)  by now doing that alone!!!! I wish I understood this when I was 20 years old just starting! If you are in your 20's consider somthing like this that motivates you to keep going and building your wealth.  

  
I mean 600 bucks isn't tons to retire on but if I was in between jobs  and had 600 monthly income going 2 months without work wouldn't be a sweat at all provided I still have a nest egg of an emergency fund but yea.. 

I am also planning buying another stock one per day that costs around 5 buck but pays out 4 cents in monthly income.  If I don't buy anything for lunch and instead pack a lunch which is cheaper than buying stuff at work then I can buy another ONE share per week.  so that would help me stay motivated to eat cheaper lunches and invest another 20 cents  a week as well. 

I still do invest all my left over monthly cash into stocks to build that divd income but for those two stocks I am not going to invest in and the only way I can get more is by ""earning them"" from these rules. 

  
May seem unnessary but it is a great way to motivate me and keep me on track at work, gym, and on lunch!  Thought it be good to share as it might help others become motivated as well and change it as they like...

  
Happy investing everyone.  I just wish I beeen doing this all along! ugh.. We really need to be telling people JUST starting out how to REALLY build wealth like this and with such simple easy steps it can be life changing I mean if I was doing this at age 20 I would have stayed on track with my diet, health and work balance and mindset so much better.. but hey, at least im starting now.

1ng6f4z,2025-09-13,2025-09-13 15:26:45,Living off dividends was my dream… but as a Polish investor I just discovered the 40% U.S. estate pay trap,"Hey everyone,

For years my dream was simple: to save enough so that I could live off dividends. I finally reached that point – I’ve been investing through Tastytrade into U.S. ETFs (mainly SCHD and some VGT), and I’ve built up a serious portfolio.

I’m 27, married, with a little daughter. I always imagined dividends as the foundation of financial security for my family – stability during my life, and something I could eventually pass down.

I also considered real estate, but honestly? It’s not as attractive anymore. ROI is low, demographics in Poland are bad, and I don’t believe property prices will keep growing like they did in the past. That’s why I went all-in on stocks and dividends.

And then I discovered the U.S. estate tax rules. Here’s the painful part:

* As a non-U.S. resident, if I hold more than **$60,000 in U.S. assets (stocks/ETFs)**, my heirs could face up to **40% estate tax** when I die.
* It doesn’t matter that I live in Poland and already pay taxes here – the U.S. only cares that the securities are listed in America, so they treat them as “U.S. assets” and apply estate tax.
* With my current portfolio, I already fall into the **highest bracket: 40% estate tax**.
* And Poland has **no estate tax treaty with the U.S.**, so I’m fully exposed.

This hit me very hard. My biggest fear is that if something happens to me, my wife and daughter won’t just lose me – they could also lose almost half of what I’ve been building for years. It feels like they’d be robbed of the very security I wanted to leave them.

People often suggest UCITS ETFs in Europe as an alternative. But let me be blunt: **UCITS ETFs are terrible compared to the U.S. ones – much more expensive, worse in performance, and with far fewer choices.** For someone who spent years building a strategy around SCHD and similar funds, switching to UCITS feels like a huge downgrade.

I know there are ways around this (family foundations, trusts, private banking), but honestly? It hurts that my dream of living off dividends turned out to be so complicated.

👉 I’d especially like to hear from people who have actually dealt with this issue in real life – how did you solve it? Did you set up a trust, a foundation, or just accept the risk? I don't know.. maybe I should just sell everything and transfer money to European broker and buy nasdaq etf and wait, or maybe buy some real estate. Ehh.

Insane holdings like Tesla with 250 PE or Palantir with *591 PE* yet are still gaining. 

Yes, the market in general is different now than when formulas like the buffet indicator were created. With instruments like 401ks being adopted across the board and personal brokerages making investing at home accessible for all, the PE *should* run hotter. Who knows when it will correct, but these 50+ PE ratios can't hold forever. (S&P lifetime average is 17). 

Additional point regarding SCHD, the dow jones index is comprised of companies actually *making physical products*, meaning there is exposure to tariffs. Unlike the tech sector that is mainly selling services, which is not exposed atm. Should the courts rule to overturn them, we could see a massive rotation.

My goal is to be able to generate income for when I'm laid off (because it's not a matter of IF but a matter of WHEN; since my company lays people off every year). Even if I'm not able to completely live off of dividends, at the very least, I want to be able to get some cash flow to survive until I get another job (which might take years considering the market). 



My friends strongly advised against dividends, but I didn't listen to them and in April of 2025, I went ahead and opened a Wells Fargo brokerage account. I have very little invested, as you can see, but the section ""estimated annual income"" indicates over 2k in dividends. I know it’s an estimate, but is it too good to be true? Because I've seen posts of other people here who get about the same amount of money in dividends per year but they have over 100k invested. So, what gives? By the way, I'm automatically reinvesting all of the dividends and only have 24 tickers so far",147,46,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ncxwg1,month,Brokerage,0.93

Coupling dividends with modest growth has been such a solid strategy for me to keep consistent with investing. I do not panic sell and I do not look at my portfolio everyday to see what the market is doing. 

My biggest positions are the SP500, NASDAQ100 and TSX60 with a few individual companies and covered call ETFs. All positions are attached. 

My goal for now is honestly maintaining a 2.5% yield and getting out of individual companies slowly. Yeah sure its high risk high reward, but I have realized I suck at stock picking and a 80% ETF portfolio would be great. Also getting the covered call ETF portion of my portfolio to 10% would be great. Currently its at \~12%.

Chart go up or chart go down, I buy. Dividends take the stress out and let me focus on other things like how to generate more money to invest etc.

1necbgo,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 11:47:45,Why I love my Dividend Portfolio,"To start my portfolio is as follows:

Taxable Account:

25% DGRO (Dividend Growth)

25% IGRO (International Dividend Growth)

25% SCHD (High Dividend Value)

25% HIMU (High Yield Municipal Bond)

IRA Account:

100% JEPI (Covered Call S&P 500 Income)

  
I hear a lot of ""Dividends don't matter"" and ""You are excluding a large part of the market...blah, blah.

What I do know is that given my portfolio I'm able to utilize dividends to not only sustain my lifestyle but also Dollar Cost Average.  So when the market tanks, and it will tank,  my portfolio will drop less than the market and to be honest I hope it drops as I'll be picking up shares on the cheap and adding to my dividend payments which will increase my take home pay and my dollar cost averaging even further.  So the reduced drawdown percentage in a downturn coupled with the Dollar Cost Averaging makes way more sense to me than just about any other approach.  When others are crying during a downturn I will be smiling, smiling smiling.......

I hit my goal of a large weekly income, so now I'm stumped on where to go, as I want to get away from weeklies, and start building a 'base' for the portfolio of steady monthly income payers, or dividend growth payers.

Basically from here where would you guys go, I'm deciding between the following:

* **Monthly Income (Funds that pay the same every month) - includes -15% withholding tax on U.S. funds:**
   * $PREF.TO (Preferred Split Corp. Fund of Funds) - 6.49% yield
   * $HDIF (Harvest Fund of Funds) - 10% yield
   * $PDIV (Non-Leverage, Dividend + option) - 12% yield
   * $PDI (Global Debt/Loans) - 11% yield
   * $YYY (Multiple Income Fund of Funds (mostly Blackrock)) - 10% yield



* **Quarterly Hikers (dividend growth companies) includes -15% withholding tax on U.S. stocks:**
   * $OZK (Financial | hikes: 1,4,7,10) - 2.8% yield (each hike: +2%)
   * $HESM (Midstream | hikes: 2,5,8,11) - 7% yield (each hike: +1-4%)
   * $EQB.TO (Financial | hikes: 3,6,9,12) - 2.3% yield(each hike: +3-5%)

Honestly, I just like these, but the increase in every payout is nice to see as well.

So, I thought I would do a revisit to the list and update it after trying out all of the new apps I was recommended.

So here is my list of top dividend and portfolio tracking apps ranked...

[https://snowball-analytics.com/](https://snowball-analytics.com/) \- 8/10 - Really good if you want more in depth analytics on your computer, but the mobile version isn't my favorite and their premium version feels a little overpriced.

DivTracker (the palm tree one) - 7/10 - I like this one because its free and pretty generous, but its the only one with ads which you can pay to have removed. It has all the analytics and features you'd expect and feels good on the phone. Link: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dividend-tracker-stock-market/id1564179613](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dividend-tracker-stock-market/id1564179613)

[https://thedividendtracker.com/](https://thedividendtracker.com/) \- 0/10 - I downloaded the mobile version and could not figure out for the life of me how to add stocks to the portfolio, you might need to do it on the web version, idk

[https://divtracker.app/](https://divtracker.app/) \- 7/10 - This one is just a super solid and robust choice, they don't have anything fancy, but it does what it does super well and the premium version is a good deal.

[https://stockevents.app/](https://stockevents.app/) \- 9/10 - This has been a long time favorite of mine. I really like how they did their mobile app, it feels very polished and high quality. I also like their web version a ton. Great app especially if you want to track all the different dividend events (such as earnings, ex dates, and more). The only thing holding it back is there was no brokerage linking for the paid version and you could only set one goal at a time.

[https://plainzer.com/](https://plainzer.com/) \- 7/10 - There is no IOS version of the app that I could find and the android version felt a bit basic, but the web version was very clean and had all the features you'd expect from a good dividend tracking tool.

[https://trackyourdividends.com/](https://trackyourdividends.com/) \- 6/10 - No mobile version at all and the web version is pretty basic, not that being super basic is bad, it does have a very clean and minimalistic view that feels nice to look at.

[https://delta.app/en](https://delta.app/en) \- 7/10 - I have only tried their mobile app and thought it was really good, it is more of a general portfolio tracker, less focused on dividends but still really solid choice.

[https://divstash.app/](https://divstash.app/) \- 10/10 - This app is newer, but this is my new favorite tracking app. It feels a lot like Stock Events, but the premium version comes with brokerage linking. Also because I am a super goal oriented investor I really enjoy how they let you create multiple super customized goals for your portfolio. Its also run by just one guy so its really impressive what he has done. (They also just added it to Android)

There were other options that I also tried out but none of them were really good enough to be added to the list.

TL;DR Same result as last time: [https://divstash.app/](https://divstash.app/) and [https://stockevents.app/](https://stockevents.app/) are my personal favorite apps with DivStash being better for me because of highly customizable goals and automatic portfolio tracking, the only reason I would go with another option would be if you want super in depth portfolio analytics on the web version then I would go with [https://snowball-analytics.com/](https://snowball-analytics.com/)

(All the apps are free too)

Again these are all just my opinions after trying each app.

So [https://divstash.app/](https://divstash.app/) is my winner, but I am curious what you guys think.",76,43,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nl4p4v/dividend_tracking_apps_ranked_updated/,month,Opinion,0.94

1nn36v1,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 16:46:44,Is (smart) dividend investing actually a better way to hit your FIRE number than throwing everything into the S&P and then reallocating later?,"Apologies if this has already been asked before, but I'm curious. I'm in my mid 20s and very serious about investing long term in order to eventually get to the point where I can live off the dividends. As of right now, pretty much all of my money is in index funds (primarily S&P).  When I first started investing with this goal in mind, I thought the best way to do it would be to keep everything in an index until you hit your number and then reallocate to dividend stocks, but I see a lot of people in this subreddit picking and sticking to dividend stocks for the long haul. What's the advantage of doing this as opposed to throwing everything into the S&P first and then reallocating to dividend stocks later? I get there would be a tax hit from reallocating depending on the account type, and I also understand it may be dependent on your time horizon, but if you're someone like me who doesn't intend on touching this money for another 30-40 years, I don't see how a portfolio of mature div stocks making a 2%-4% dividend yield with little growth potential is advantageous to compounding cap gains in the S&P.

1nsmj8i,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 08:00:06,ChatGPT is too generic for investment analysis,"I've been trying to use ChatGPT for investment research but keep hitting the same wall - it gives balanced, generic responses instead of how real investors actually think, plus it doesn't have access to current financial data.

For example, if I ask about Tesla:

  \- ChatGPT: ""Here are pros and cons to consider..."" (using outdated info)

  \- What Charlie Munger would probably say: ""Multiple kill-switches triggered - current debt ratio 2.1x, ROE dropped to 8.2%, avoid immediately""

The problem is ChatGPT is trained to be helpful and neutral, but legendary investors have strong opinions and specific methodologies. Plus it can't access real-time financials or recent news.

So I had this idea: what if someone built AI specifically trained on individual investors with live data integration? Like you could actually chat with:

  \- ""AI Charlie Munger"" using his kill-switch framework + current financials

  \- ""AI Warren Buffett"" applying his moat analysis + recent earnings

  \- ""AI Peter Lynch"" with his growth methodology + latest news

Even better - imagine a ""board meeting"" feature where all three analyze the same stock using current data and you see where they agree vs. disagree.

Key features I'm thinking:

  \- Real-time financial data (earnings, ratios, cash flow)

  \- Recent news integration and sentiment analysis

  \- Opinionated takes based on actual methodologies

  \- Multiple investor perspectives on same stock

  \- Portfolio upload for personalized analysis

I'd honestly pay $25-30/month for something like this vs. fighting with ChatGPT's outdated, generic responses.

Questions:

  1. Would real-time data integration make this significantly more valuable?

  2. What would you pay for specialized AI with live financial data vs. generic tools?

  3. Which legendary investors would you most want to ""chat"" with about current market conditions?

  4. Would you upload your portfolio for multi-investor analysis?

Anyone else frustrated with ChatGPT's limitations for current investment analysis?

Edit: For those asking about feasibility - the AI technology exists, and financial APIs are available.

1nva0ve,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 10:39:54,JEPI vs SPYI: Which Do You Like?,"Been comparing JEPI and SPYI lately since they both show up a lot when people talk about income ETFs. On the surface they look similar (covered call strategies with big yields) but the numbers and portfolios tell a different story from my analysis.

I created a hypothetical portfolio on Dividend Watch with $10k invested in both to get a sense of total returns, and other details my broker lacks for these securities.

[$10k comparison, including annual income differences](https://preview.redd.it/9bwoykqxhisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=50788313ebc101ae492cbadb2765eb6cfb9e044a)

If you had put $10K into each a year ago, the results aren’t the same. JEPI would have thrown off about $812 in income with an 8.4% yield, while SPYI would’ve paid closer to $1,200 with an 11.7% yield. Total return was also stronger for SPYI over that stretch.

Looking at dividends, JEPI’s story hasn’t been great. Payouts dropped from $6.36/share in 2022 to about $3.21 this year. That’s a downward trend that makes me cautious. SPYI, on the other hand, is newer but has been ramping up. It paid $1.89 in 2022, jumped to $5.79 in 2023, hit $6.12 in 2024, and even though 2025 is tracking lower at $4.04, the overall trajectory is still more encouraging than JEPI’s slide.

The holdings explain a lot. JEPI spreads things out — tech is its biggest sector but only around 20%, with healthcare, financials, and industrials right behind. SPYI leans more heavily into growth names: tech is over a third of the fund (34%), and then financials, consumer cyclical, and comm services make up most of the rest. It’s more tilted toward the S&P’s heavyweights.

[SPYI breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/ex8u2sr0iisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bd03a41f4bd3dcddbd969615cb16c6130c382c0)

[SPYI dividends](https://preview.redd.it/nhkhktr0iisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=215955f04f63c47077fb5269e4a2efc625291e8d)

[JEPI breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/35ufctr0iisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=65c196905bc91a6058b620e0bd8fa8eaf6e3cbc5)

So the trade-off looks something like this:

* JEPI is the more established, diversified option, but its shrinking payouts are a red flag.
* SPYI is newer and a bit more aggressive, with higher yield and stronger recent results, though its dividend history isn’t as long and the 2025 dip shows it won’t always be smooth sailing.

1nisaxv,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 16:09:31,Top 3 dividend/growth plays from my portfolio (+ 1 joker pick),"I would love to hear everybody else's answers to the 2 questions below which are two of the most common questions I get as a value/dividend investor.

1. Which are your best dividend stocks right now when you look at total growth (dividends + dividend growth + stock price appreciation)?
2. Do you DRIP?

 Here are my own answers:

The quick answer to question no. 2 is: No, I don’t DRIP. In this post I’ll focus on question no. 1, but I’ve also shared a link to an older post here where I go into detail about my dividend strategy and why I don’t DRIP.

Getting back to question no. 1: The enclosed screenshot is a snapshot from my IBKR (Interactive Brokers) account showing some of my dividend positions and how they’ve done over the past 4–5 years:

**Important note:**

1. The performance of the tickers below only reflects unrealised gains and does not include the dividends I’ve received along the way, so the actual total return is higher.
2. I have owned several of these stocks on and off during the past 24 years. The positions mentioned below have alI been initiated within the past 3-5 years, with the exception of HSBC which I have only owned since April '25. I have been adding to most of the positions below during corrections — latest in April ’25.

The following 3 have been some of my favourite Total Growth dividend stocks:

**UNM: +185% (6.5% YOC)**  
Boring old insurer, very under the radar, but valuation was low and returns have been excellent.

**ABBV: +169% (8.1% YOC)**  
Big pharma cash flow machine. Humira decline was a concern but the pipeline and new drugs have carried growth.

**SPG: +130% (8.1% YOC)**  
Class-A malls and outlets. They bounced back strong after COVID and have kept raising the dividend.

And then a joker pick outside the screenshot is **RITM**, yielding 8.0% right now. I owned it pre-pandemic and took a loss, but post-pandemic it might actually be my best performer. I re-entered at $4.33 in April ’20, and most recently added 4,000 shares at $9.77 in April ’25. The quarterly dividends are remarkable and add a lot of dry powder every three months.

RITM is a mREIT with a broad engine (MSRs, credit, servicing). It can be volatile, but the dividend has held up well. I also expect a dividend increase and/or a potential spinoff of the NewRez division, which could unlock further value for investors in 2026. RITM has also structured and hedged its business intelligently, making it less sensitive to interest rate changes.

Another great dividend-paying stock which has been winning my heart lately is HSBC. I had wanted to own it for quite a while and finally bought in on April 7th during the tariff scare at $48.36 (2.2% YOC). Since then it has gone up 43%.

**HSBC** is one of the world’s largest banks with a strong footprint in Asia, the UK, and global wealth management. Rising rates and cost discipline have boosted earnings, and capital returns have improved with consistent dividend hikes and buybacks. For me it’s a solid play with global diversification, and I see further upside as they keep simplifying the business and focusing on higher-return markets.

That’s my take. I do own several other great dividend-paying value stocks, REITs and BDCs, but that’s another story.

**I would love to hear how others here would answer those two questions:**

1. **Which dividend stocks have given you the best total growth the past few years?**
2. **And do you DRIP, or not — and why?**

Here is the link to my previous post which also includes my views on DRIP, and my dividend and reinvestment strategy:

1nkch3r,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 12:08:41,JEPI vs JEPQ Detailed Breakdown,"Been digging into JEPI and JEPQ the past few days since they’re some of the most talked about covered call ETFs right now. Both kick out high yields, but once looking closer, they’re built pretty differently.

I built a hypothetical portfolio in Dividend Watch to run some numbers that my broker doesn't really provide, and there are some interesting takes.

On yield alone, JEPQ looks like the winner. It’s paying around 10.7% right now ($6.08/share annually), compared to JEPI at about 8.4% ($4.78/share). But the payout history flips the story a bit. JEPI’s income has been trending down. It was paying $6.36 back in 2022 and it’s tracking closer to $3.21 so far this year. JEPQ’s gone the other direction, climbing from $3.85 in 2022 to a little over $6 annually today. So JEPI feels like it’s slipping, while JEPQ’s been showing some growth.

The portfolios explain a lot of the difference. JEPI spreads things out: tech is the biggest slice at about 20%, but healthcare, financials, and industrials are all in that same ballpark. It feels more balanced, like a fund designed not to swing too wildly if one sector struggles. JEPQ is basically a concentrated Nasdaq income play. Over half of it is tech, and then another 30% is tied up in communication services and consumer cyclical. If tech’s hot, you’re golden. If not, you’re going to feel it.

So the trade-off seems pretty clear:

* JEPI = diversified and steadier, but the shrinking payouts raise questions.
* JEPQ = higher yield and actual dividend growth, but it’s a much bigger bet on tech.

I can see the case for holding both, but personally I’m leaning toward JEPQ if I’m chasing income and JEPI if I want something a little less tied to Nasdaq performance.

Curious what others here are doing. Are you sticking with one, splitting between them, or skipping both for something else like SCHD or VYM?",38,23,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nkch3r,month,Discussion,0.86

1ndl3kk,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 13:45:05,Dividend income and total return are NOT always interchangeable,"I keep trying to have a useful discussion about dividend income during retirement, and every time, across multiple subs, it’s derailed by people saying to ignore dividends and focus on total return, because they’re effectively the same. This has even happened on this sub, where I wrongly assumed people would see through such a misunderstanding.

Either these people are wrong, or I’m misunderstanding something very fundamental. So, let’s have it out. I’ll make my argument, and people can tell me where I’m wrong, and I’ll either walk away having learned my lesson, or finally conclude that most people are just confused on this issue.

First, I want to acknowledge where I think people who make this argument are coming from and agree that they have a point in certain scenarios.

Let’s say I have two stocks, KO and Example Corp. (EXAM). KO pays a reliable dividend and EXAM doesn’t pay a dividend. Assume I’m in a tax-advantaged account, and nearing retirement but not actually in it, so we’ll ignore the tax implications for now. If EXAM and KO (including DRIP) both gain 25% in one year, it’s true that in many ways the dividend doesn’t matter. I’m still 25% richer from either one, and I can sell either stock just as easily. As I understand it, this is the point people are making when they say total return and dividends are interchangeable, so just focus on total return. In this scenario, I agree that they are interchangeable.

However, there are many scenarios where dividend income and total return have extremely different properties, and this matters a lot, and *that is the entire point of dividends*.

A personal finance example illustrates the point. Imagine you got hired for a job, and they agreed to pay you $100,000 a year. You eagerly await your first paycheck, and it never arrives. You complain to HR, and they explain, “Oh, at this company, we don’t pay in a consistent, predictable way like other companies. We pay you in random amounts at unexpected intervals. Some days you may receive a check for $4.63, some days you get a check for $7080.21, and some days you get nothing. But, we promise, by the end of the year, you’ll receive a total of $100,000.”

Very few people would continue working at such a place, because *consistency and predictability of cash flow is extremely important*. Many people couldn’t pay their bills that situation.

When you retire, your portfolio becomes your paycheck, so the cash flow you draw from it matters. Yes, there are many strategies for making the income smooth and predictable, and dividend payments are only one strategy. However, dividends, at least from reliable companies, have a different risk profile than other strategies, and this gives them different advantages and disadvantages.

Among highly reliable companies (say, the Dividend Aristocrats or Dividend Kings), the following is true:

1. It has never happened that half the companies in these lists suddenly quit paying dividends. Some do quit paying dividends, but it’s on the order of 1-2% on any given year.
2. It has never happened that the majority of the companies in these lists reduce their dividends dramatically in a short period of time. In fact, all of them have increased their dividends for 25 years straight, including through the 2008 recession.
3. Even if the market value of the companies gets cut in half, you still get your full dividends.
4. Over the long term, both the dividend payouts and the market value of the companies tends to grow at a rate that exceeds inflation. Therefore, if you never sell any shares, it is extremely unlikely your portfolio value will ever fall to $0.

In other words, the risk that my dividend income will go away or dramatically shrink is very low. This has been true over many decades and though many recessions.

In contrast, the following is true of the stock market in general:

1. It may dramatically (25-50%) drop in value at any time and take years to recover.
2. You may have to sell stocks while the market is down, compounding your losses.
3. If you miscalculate your safe withdrawal rate (SWR), perhaps because of a bad market early on in your retirement, you may go broke before you die.

I understand that there are ways to mitigate risk on the total return side (e.g., mixing in bonds). I agree that they are pretty good and I plan to also use them during retirement. However, they have a different risk profile. I work in risk management, and have a master’s in the subject, and different risk profiles matter, a lot.

Put simply, with dividend paying companies, your primary risk is mismanagement by leadership. With total return, your primary risk is market timing. These are not the same.

While dividend income can always be treated as total returns, total returns cannot always be treated as income without potentially locking in big losses. In other words, the interchangeability only reliably goes one way.

Large companies understand this, and that’s why they pay dividends despite the tax disadvantages. Institutional investors understand this, and that’s why they demand dividends despite the tax disadvantages. Every investor should understand this, so they can make an informed decision about which risks they are most comfortable taking.

1ncmd84,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 11:41:59,Correct my train of thought - using qqqi to park cash instead of a 4% money market for higher yield,"Background - all set on other investments, no debt, etc etc.

Have $70k sitting in a cash account making 4%.  This isn't earmarked for emergency or retirement. Maybe something in the middle - if I casually come across a piece of property or want a shiny new toy

Came across qqqi and thought it might be a good alternative.  The idea is that the principal could still be liquidated for a larger purchase, but in the meantime have it cashflow a few more bucks to enjoy guilt free hobbies/weekend getaways.

I 100% get the price of qqqi falling so I'd be exposed to that - but rationally I just wouldn't sell at that time ( maybe buy more?)

My napkin math says it should pay 3x what I'm making on the cash account after taxes and fees.

So first - is the math correct?

Am I correct in saying if I paid $53/share and a year later I sell at $53 a share - thats a wash ( no tax implications) and really no different that pulling out my principal, just like I would on the money market account?

Am I missing anything ( like is the tax situation better or worse than what I'm thinking?

Better alternatives?

napkin math on $70k

|Investment|Gross Monthly|After-Tax Monthly (est.)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Money Market (4%)|$233|**$177**|
|QQQI ETF (\~14% yield)|$817|**$590**|

Edit : Re-highlighting this cash isn't set aside for emergencies - I have a separate account with 2 years expenses already filled for that.  I guess if there was an emergency with a greater need, I'd probably be tapping in to more buckets than just this one.

  
Edit 2: Decided on putting $25k in to QQI - figured that can get me close to the current dividends of the entire $70k the money market ( about $200 /month) , and will look in to some of the other suggestions to place the remaining $45k :-) I agree with spreading it out a bit or even holding it in cash longer for a deal to come up.

1nasxhg,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 09:16:37,Dividend Portfolio 2025 – Should I stay with income focus or switch to growth?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve recently started building a dividend-focused portfolio and I’d love to get some feedback.

# My Goals

* Preserve and grow capital (I don’t want erosion)
* Generate consistent monthly income (like a “salary”)
* Reinvest all dividends until mid-2026
* Long-term wealth growth, but I’m not sure if my allocation is right

Current portfolio (about 21K ):

* SCHD – 162.99 shares (\~$4,505)
* JEPI – 74.63 shares (\~$4,237)
* JEPQ – 20.26 shares (\~$1,130)
* SPYI – 42.88 shares (\~$2,214)
* QQQI – 44.36 shares (\~$2,359)
* IYRI – 35.37 shares (\~$1,799)
* O – 28.21 shares (\~$1,666)
* STAG – 41.93 shares (\~$1,551)
* LTC – 43.50 shares (\~$1,593)

💵 Current dividends: about **$110-130/month**  
💵 Plan: I’m adding **$6K per month until May 2026** (around $54K more).

# My Dilemma

* Should I keep this income-heavy allocation?
* Or move towards more **growth exposure (maybe 60% covered call, 40% growth)?**
   * For growth I’m considering **Microsoft, Google, Meta**.
* My worry: am I **missing the train** if I stay too dividend-focused?
* Is it smarter to just go full growth now and switch to dividends later?

I’m still learning and don’t feel I have enough knowledge yet, so your thoughts would mean a lot 🙏

Thanks in advance!

Initially, my UNH weighting was lower (I began DCA when it was around $270), but its weighting has increased recently due to gains.

1n9o62m,2025-09-05,2025-09-05 22:31:31,PizzaTrader Stock of the Month: September 2025,"My Stock of the Month selections are outperforming both SCHD and the S&P 500 index (as tracked by VOO) so far this year. Because of this, some readers have expressed interest in how I select these companies. My goal is to educate on how to generate wealth with dividend investing, so I am glad to share one of my methods with today’s post. 

To find great dividend companies, I comb through the holdings of popular dividend growth ETFs (SCHD, DIVO, FDVV, etc.) and I also run several of my own screeners. I look for companies that consistently raise dividends, show steady profitability, and have excellent margins (gross, operating, and profit). Bonus points for companies with low debt and active stock buyback programs. Once I find these companies (there are hundreds of good ones!) I track price movements and values with custom-built spreadsheets. 

The picture you see at the top of this post is a chart I built this week to represent the type of buying opportunities I’m looking for. The price line (blue) has recently dipped back into the undervalued band (green) based on dividend yield. The undervalued and overvalued bands (red) are calculated from historical yields on the company’s dividend payments. The chart demonstrates that if a company has strong profitability and strong dividend growth, an investor might want to buy it at nearly any price, but particularly when price is undervalued. You can see that price tends to revert to the mean.

This month’s featured stock is CME Group (CME).
Disclosure: I own a position and presently intend to hold into the future. 
Disclaimer: For educational purposes only, not investment advice.

Dividend Highlights:
- The current dividend is $10.80 annually, translating to a yield of 4.12% at the current stock price of $261.94.

- CME began paying dividends in 2003 following its IPO in 2002 and has increased its dividend for 6 consecutive years.

- The average dividend yield over the past 10 years has been 3.85%. Therefore, today’s investor will purchase a cash flow stream 7% more valuable than the long-term average.

- I typically aim for a 15% Chowder Ratio with new stock purchases. CME has a great Chowder Ratio of 17.25%!

Investment Performance:
- An investor who bought $10,000 worth of CME 10 years ago and reinvested all dividends would have experienced total returns of 323.76% with a current value of $42,376. This performance marginally defeated broad market indexes (like the S&P 500), although this performance may not continue into the future.

- The 2015 investor initially bought the stock at a yield of 4.39%, expecting $4.00 per share in their first year of ownership. Today, that same investor is set to earn $10.80 per share, resulting in a yield on cost of 11.85%. As with all of my Stock of the Month selections, patience has paid off for long-term investors!

Future Outlook:
- While the future is always uncertain, investing in CME Group comes with several potential rewards, including annual dividend increases, price improvements, and high likelihood for ongoing dividends. 

- The company’s annual variable dividend payment is typically announced in December, but won’t occur until the first quarter in 2026. The next increase in the routine quarterly dividend payment will likely be announced at a similar time.  2025’s announcement involved an 8.7% increase in the quarterly dividend. 

- The company’s dividend payout ratio is over 100%, so there is risk that earnings won’t permit significant future growth. However, the company has manageable debt and has grown earnings consistently to support dividends. 

- There is also an opportunity for price improvement. Assuming a slowing dividend growth rate of 10% until 2030, with no change in dividend yield, today’s investor might have stock worth $419 (60% price return) and earn a yield on cost of 6.59%.
 
Conclusion:
-  For the above reasons, CME is my choice for Stock of the Month and is well-positioned to continue its long-term creation of shareholder wealth. 

Portfolio Performance:
-  The Stock of the Month portfolio (eight months so far), is up 13.8% in price and has earned 1.27% in dividends for a total return (dividends not reinvested) of 15.1%. This is favorable to SCHD’s 4.38% total return over the same time period.

I currently save around €6,000 a year and spend practically nothing on anything that is not necessary. My goal is to grow my assets and not depend solely on my work.

I currently have €35,000 invested with a financial advisor, and the truth is that I am doing very well with it. But I want to learn to manage part of my assets on my own to feel more financially secure and improve my investment system.

I work a lot and my monthly income is €1,600, so any advice on how to invest intelligently, diversify or strategies that allow me to grow in the long term would be of great help to me

1ncljm0,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 11:10:38,JEPI vs GPIX maybe SPYI,"I’ve been following this thread for a while, and the more I learn, the more I realize how much I don’t know.

First: I’ve noticed a big divide when it comes to MSTY. Some people point out the steady NAV decline, while others don’t seem to care as long as their dividend income outweighs their initial cash outlay.

Second: A lot of people here seem to like JEPI. I was considering it for a portfolio I’m building, but when I looked at the NAV chart, it honestly left me a little discouraged.

Third: I recently came across GPIX. It looks like it has a lower expense ratio and a different mix of assets compared to JEPI. It seems like GPIX is at least trying to preserve NAV, though maybe it’s not as defensive. SPYI might be another option too.

What do you all think? 
Maybe if you’re in this position, share your portfolio design? This person has income from residential real estate, so I wasn’t planning any REITs.  These investments would be in an IRA for a 72yr old facing RMDs soon. He doesn’t really need the income (gets nervous if net worth declines), but I was hoping the RMDs would encourage him to start living a more plentiful life. I.e. a new truck, a vacation, or maybe even a steak that’s not from the expired section of the cooler!



EDIT: this is the portfolio design I was thinking.

5% VPU  or XLU

But please accept the premise and consider an answer. I.e. this is not asking whether there is a real estate bubble, and nor is it about to burst; it's about understanding REIT risk).

REITs pay very nice dividends/distributions, largely as required by law (some percentage of revenue has to be paid out in order to be a REIT with all of those benefits). When interest rates decline, dividend/income paying stocks should increase in value. 

But what if in addition to interest rates declining (and the reason for the decline), the real estate bubble bursts because of overpriced real estate, or a deep recession, business failures and defaults (commercial real estate), homeowners default because of unemployment, homeowners default because they really couldn't afford their mortgage in the first place (a la 2008), etc.

I decided to go for a dividend portfolio, with copmanies that has a worldwide presence, like mcd, nke, sbux, v, ect. and the reason is that i don't want my portfolio to be restricted only to one region or county. I have find these companies that have worldwide presence: mcd, nke, sbux, ko, pep, pg, cl, mkc, jnj, abt, abbv, mdt, novob, novn, azn, rog, msft, aapl, v, ma, orcl, blk, acn, cat, etn, emr, cvx, xom, adm, de, nesn, una, or, sie, sap, muv2, tte, hen, dge, bn(danone), txn.

\-High-growth dividend stocks (7–10% CAGR) usually start at 1–2% yield and trade at rich multiples.

\-High-yield stocks (6–9%) usually have flat or zero growth, but give me immediate cash to reinvest elsewhere.

\-Assuming full reinvestment, the closest point in my models between these two strategies is often around years 12–15.

So my core question is:

Are we underestimating the long-term power of YOC and dividend growth compounding, or overestimating the risk of high-yield sustainability?

I’d love to hear from other dividend-focused investors:

\-How do you model this trade-off between current yield and future dividend growth?

\-Does anyone currently run long-term (20+ years) backtests comparing DGI vs high yield portfolios?

I-s a “hybrid” portfolio (3–4% initial yield + 5–6% growth) the sweet spot, or just a compromise that underperforms both?

Really curious to see how others are thinking about this. Let's debate.",10,21,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nk4xlt/dividend_growth_vs_high_yield_are_we/,month,Discussion,0.86

But my mom’s on food stamps and my dads struggling mostly due to some bad choices they still make. Im 18 and make $42K a year and want to know what i should put my money into and what goals i should set for myself to grow wealth and get my parents to a better place once i have my own self situated. I work at sanderson farms and have a really strong work ethic so the work seems very easy to me while others complain. Pay is good though just very strict on scheduling, i want to make money but also have more freedom to go out with friends and family and do things i enjoy. 

Gas is about $2.50 a gallon. Food is alot cheaper here. And housing is $20K-110K to completely own a home. Cost of living is very low and i make roughly $20 a hour with overtime pay over 40hours. Just looking for advice so i can get myself a place to stay in the next 10 years hopefully sooner than later. I have multiple family members that let me stay with them since theyre closer to work than where i live and they dont mind since i keep to myself and buy groceries. 

Looking for life and financial advice and honestly even job recommendations for someone at my age. And what trades would be good? If thats even worth my time. Just wanna know how to build a strong future

The thing is, I want to invest my money, but I have no idea where to start. Most stock news and analysis I find online Yahoo Finance, other market reports use so much technical jargon that I often feel lost.

One resource that’s actually helped me a lot is TheValeLetter dot com newsletter about 60% of their content is visual, which makes it way easier for me to understand stock analysis and trends.

1nskvny,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 06:24:58,Dividend investor in Europe: keep Realty Income ($O) or switch to EURO iSTOXX High Dividend Low Volatility 50 ETF?,"I’ve been dividend-investing for a bit and have held Realty Income ($O) for over a year. After digging into the tax side, I realized that in my country (Europe) dividends end up taxed at roughly \~42.5% even though the W-8BEN limits U.S. withholding to 15%.

Given that drag, I’m considering switching the position into an EU-domiciled ETF that tracks the **EURO iSTOXX® High Dividend Low Volatility 50** index to avoid the U.S. withholding and simplify taxes.

**ETF I’m looking at (example):**

* **Invesco EURO STOXX High Dividend Low Volatility UCITS ETF**
   * **Index:** EURO iSTOXX High Dividend Low Volatility 50
   * **ISIN:** IE00BZ4BMM98 — **Ticker:** EHDV (various exchanges)
   * **Structure:** UCITS, Ireland-domiciled, **distributing quarterly**
   * **Replication:** Physical, holds 50 stocks
   * **TER:** **0.30% p.a.**
   * **Fund size:** \~€202m
   * **Current dividend yield:** **\~5.2%**, last 12 months paid \~€1.57 per share (figures per justETF; date on their page Sept 2025)
   * Source: justETF profile; STOXX index page/factsheet. ([justETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BZ4BMM98))



1. For those in Europe facing high effective taxes on U.S. dividends: have you found **EU-domiciled UCITS dividend ETFs** (ideally **“reporting funds”** in your country) that deliver a **higher net-of-tax yield** than EHDV? Any favorites to compare?
2. My understanding is that **$O is a U.S. REIT/stock and not an Austrian-style “reporting fund (Meldefonds).”** If you’re in the EU/Austria, does moving from a U.S. single stock like $O to an **EU-domiciled UCITS reporting fund** materially improve your **after-tax** income?
3. Are there **better products for pure income** (e.g., other EURO STOXX/Europe high-dividend strategies, or even all-Europe high-dividend low-volatility variants) that historically offer a **higher distribution yield** than EHDV without taking on excessive risk?
4. Anything I’m missing re: **withholding tax, tax credits, or broker handling** that would change the O vs. EU-dividend-ETF calculus?

1nnz87l,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 17:30:58,Research For Success,"I mean no disrespect to anyone, but I'm amazed at how many people ask ""what should I do"" in regards to their portfolios or what they should buy or sell. 

Do the research, learn how the markets work, learn the indicators to help you make a decision, and go forward.

When I first started seriously investing for retirement when I was in my early 30s, I had no clue how the markets worked. So I started reading & learning...and this was before internet resources were available. I had our funds at a brokerage where an agent made the buying & selling decisions for us. Soon learned that the vast majority of investors made the decisions over what to buy and sell even using a firm, and I recognized I had started doing that too.

So I cancelled the managed account and transferred holdings to a discount brokerage, E-Trade. I later left E-Trade and now have been with Schwab for over 30 years, and they are great.

I haven't asked anyone for advice for over 35 years now and rely on my own knowledge, experience, and confidence on buying & selling.

When I was 36 & wife was 34, we had $5,000 to our name and were about $18,000 in debt. We are now 70 & 68 and own our home ($650k) debt free with about $1.4M in retirement accounts with $400,000 in Roths. No other debt at all.

While we both did have a 401k with our respective employers, they were immediately rolled to Schwab IRAs when we retired. We started the Roths separately.

I've made mistakes in the past and will likely make mistakes in the future, but mistakes are what you learn from and help make future success.

I implore everyone to start studying finance and investing and have the confidence in your decisions. Most of the folks posts I read in r/dividends give a lot of advice, but are wrong in the comments they make. Not everyone, as some commenters are very aware and knowledgeable, but a larger percentage are clueless.

After I left the managed brokerage, I've never listened to anyone who said...you should buy this...or...you own that!!?!...you should sell. Conversely, I've never recommended to anyone else what they should buy, even when they asked my advice. Instead, I tried to give them the tools to make those decisions themselves. 

The only advice I gave to a friend was back in 2007/8 when markets were getting ready to tank and the real estate bubble burst. I told him I sold everything and saved several $100,000 in losses. He said.. ""why didn't you tell me?"" I said, ""I did, you chose to ignore me.""  The market indicators just worried me then and I luckily made the decision to get out. It didn't take long before I did some bottom feeding and got back in. 

Once again, learn how the system works and be confident in your decisions. Don't rely on another person to qualify your decisions...be confident!!

1ny9jmn,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 20:00:27,PizzaTrader Stock of the Month: October 2025,"Those of you who have followed along with my posts have hopefully learned that market pessimism towards high quality companies presents opportunity. At this moment, restaurants and companies supporting the restaurant industry are slightly beaten down. This will allow us to grab future cash flows at a discount and improve our chances for price gains over the long term.

This month’s featured stock is Domino’s Pizza (DPZ).
Disclosure: I own a position and presently intend to hold into the future. 
Disclaimer: For educational purposes only, not investment advice.

Business Model:
DPZ earns income from royalties and franchise fees from over 20,000 retail pizza stores, as well as the sale of ingredients and supplies to those franchisees.

Dividend Highlights:
- The current dividend is $6.96 annually, translating to a yield of 1.63% at the current stock price of $426.71.

- DPZ has increased its dividend for 11 consecutive years.

- The average dividend yield over the past 10 years has been 1.06%. Therefore, today’s investor will purchase a cash flow stream 59% more valuable than the long-term average.

- I typically aim for a 15% Chowder Ratio with new stock purchases. DPZ has an excellent Chowder Ratio of 19.04%!

Investment Performance:
- An investor who bought $10,000 worth of DPZ 10 years ago and reinvested all dividends would have experienced total returns of 344.56% with a current value of $44,456. This performance defeated broad market indexes (like the S&P 500), although this performance may not continue into the future.

- The 2015 investor initially bought the stock at a yield of 1.14%, expecting $1.24 per share in their first year of ownership. Today, that same investor is set to earn $6.96 per share, resulting in a yield on cost of 6.42%. As with all of my Stock of the Month selections, patience has paid off for long-term investors!

Future Outlook:
- While the future is always uncertain, investing in Domino’s comes with several potential rewards, including annual dividend increases, price improvements, and high likelihood for ongoing dividends. 

- The company’s annual dividend is typically announced early each year.  The dividend increase in 2025 was an excellent 15.2% and has been double digits over each of the last 10 years!

- The company’s dividend payout ratio is 40%, a healthy ratio which would allow dividends to double over the next 5 years (14% CAGR) without requiring any earnings growth.

- There is also an opportunity for price improvement. Assuming a steady dividend growth rate of 15% until 2030, and a return to the average dividend yield of 1.06%, today’s investor might have stock worth $1,301.89 (205% price return) and earn a yield on cost of 3.23%.
 
Conclusion:
-  For the above reasons, DPZ is my choice for Stock of the Month and is well-positioned to continue its long-term creation of shareholder wealth. 

Portfolio Performance:
The Stock of the Month portfolio (nine months so far), is up 10.8% in price and has earned 1.26% in dividends for a total return (dividends not reinvested) of 12.1%. This is favorable to SCHD’s 4.02% total return over the same time period.

If you automatically reinvest dividends, what happens if the dividends are not enough to cover the purchase of a single share? Do they accrue over time until they reach the sum that can cover the purchase of a holding? 

For example, each share of VOO costs $615.17

Let's suppose I buy 5 of them and set to automatically reinvest the dividends. The dividends that 5 shares of VOO pay are not sufficient to buy another single share of VOO. So, what happens in that case? In my opinion, the most logical explanation is that the dividends accrue until they reach $615.17 and that is when the automatic purchase is made.

1nxvxu3,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 10:47:36,A tech stock with 2% yield just beat every utility in our dividend rankings.,"Our systematic dividend framework ranked QUALCOMM #1 in October. Not a utility. Not a REIT. A semiconductor company yielding 2.09%.

If that surprises you, your screening process might be filtering out quality before you ever evaluate it.

**What happened:**  
We score every S&P 500 dividend payer monthly using identical criteria: sustainability (30%), growth (25%), yield quality (25%), and consistency (20%). See further details in this post:   
  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1mpx2n6/why\_we\_stopped\_chasing\_high\_yields\_and\_built\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1mpx2n6/why_we_stopped_chasing_high_yields_and_built_this/)  


QUALCOMM scored 7.9/10 with near-perfect sustainability metrics:

* 32% payout ratio (paying less than 1/3 of earnings)
* \>9 consecutive years of 7% dividend growth
* Perfect free cash flow coverage
* A balance sheet that can weather severe downturns

**Why this matters:**  
Most dividend investors start by filtering sectors: Utilities + REITs + Consumer Staples only. Then sort by yield, highest first.

That approach eliminates QUALCOMM before you ever look at the fundamentals. Wrong sector. Low yield. Never considered.

We picked it in August at $150.58. By October, it hit $166.36 (+10.5% dividend-adjusted). Three months is obviously too short to validate any methodology, but it demonstrates the concept: we identified sustainable quality before price reflected it, not by predicting movement but by evaluating fundamentals systematically.

**The challenge to conventional wisdom:**  
Traditional dividend screening assumes quality lives in specific sectors. But business models evolved. Technology companies with licensing revenue now generate more stable cash than many cyclical industrials or retailers. A 2% yield backed by a 32% payout ratio will compound for decades. A 6% yield at 80% payout has nowhere to go but down.

We weight sustainability heaviest (30% of score) for one reason: dividend cuts destroy you twice. Capital loss + income loss. Finding companies that won't cut matters more than finding companies yielding 6% today.

Is anyone else here evaluating dividends without sector filters? Or do you think we're crazy for ranking a semiconductor over utilities and REITs?

1nxs9jj,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 08:09:04,Novo Nordisk (NVO): A 46.5% ARR Opportunity and a 2.9% Starting Yield,"NVO is currently trading at $59.63 against my calculated fair value of $88, suggesting a potential **46.5% anticipated annual rate of return** (ARR) over the next 3 years. This ARR is based on consensus revenue estimates and regression analysis of median-reverting metrics like EV/Revenue and Price-to-Book ratios, essentially projecting where the stock should trade as valuations normalize.

As far as quality:

**Gross Margins at 83.9%** is outstanding. For context, pharma companies typically run 60-80% gross margins, so NVO is at the upper end. The chart shows remarkable stability around 80-85% over the past decade, indicating strong pricing power and efficient manufacturing.

**Operating Margins of 45.8%** demonstrates excellent operational efficiency. While pharma can range from 20-50%, NVO's consistent 40%+ shows they're converting those high gross margins into actual operating profit effectively.

**Interest Coverage at 16.9x** means the company earns nearly 17 times what it needs to service debt. Anything above 5x is considered safe; this is fortress-level financial stability.

The one yellow flag is the **Cash Conversion at 55.8%**, which is below the ideal 80-100% range, suggesting some gap between reported earnings and actual cash generation. Worth monitoring.

With the GLP-1 market exploding and NVO dominating the space, do you all view this valuation gap as a genuine opportunity or are there demand sustainability concerns I'm missing?",40,22,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nxs9jj,new,Due Diligence,0.87
1nxrqqp,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 07:42:11,Dividend Strategy - Ireland,"I (32m) really like the idea of dividend investing - I'm really drawn to the idea of semi-stable monthly/quarterly income generated from the money I've earned through work. 

That being said, I'm in the younger side and the prevailing wisdom is growth over dividend until much later in life.

So at the start of this year, after some research, I decided to invest monthly in three etfs - iShares core world IWDA (growth), Vanguard S&P 500 VUSA (growth) and JPM global premium equity JEPG (dividend). With some heavy investing and some restrictions on cost/qualiry of living (not monk level, minor stuff)

My ultimate goal, like many, is to get to a point where my baseline costs of living is covered if/when something happens to my full time job. 

I had a 33.33% DCA split for the first few months but then I got a bit impatient, sold my positions in IWDA and VUSA and concentrated on getting JEPG to a significant point. 

Now, we're coming toward the end of the year. My JEPG position is ~4000 shares (~€92k) and the dividend has been significantly lower than i had modeled (~.15 per share monthly compared to ~.2 modelled) and due to the weak dollar I'm down overall. 

I'm kind of ok with this position, it earns me gross ~€500 euro a month, maybe more, maybe less, and will build. But I expected to be closer to net €500 a month by the end of the year. 

I suppose the question is, is this the best thing to do with your investing capital? Are there better ways to use my money to generate a secondary income? I also really hate the high tax on this in Ireland so any suggestions on how to minimise the tax drag would be amazing. 

Any general critiques of this approach or suggestions on better approaches specific to Irish investors would be great!

1nwxwuj,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 08:35:27,Dear CC aficionados - what makes you think new kids on the block won't emulate fate of QYLD?,"There is no shortage of daily posts by covered call aficionados eulogizing SPYI, QQQI, GPIX, GPIQ etc. Used to be similar feverish activity for JEPQ last year.

But this eerily resembles the madness around covid time when QYLD suddenly shot out into the daylight. Every other post either demonized it or praised it as if this was the messiah that would help dividend lovers retire. Every tom dick and harry was writing about it, on blogs/you tube/reddit. 

Have a look at the chart below. Although it was well know that QYLD suffered from NAV erosion, it actually did well for 8 years or so by recovering to its inception price of 25 bucks - twice. In other words, it did rise when markets kept rising. Not bad if something delivers 10% and has a modest NAV erosion. BUT then some thing happened right around Feb 2020  - It just started nose diving and has not been able to rise again even though markets have far surpassed the ATH of Feb 2020.

I don't know what exactly changed in 2020. But i worry that similar fate may be in store for cc etfs that are being touted today by rainy season frogs. Although the initial performance of these is quite good but so was QYLD for  god damn 8 years.

1nwnzek,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 23:02:20,Mortgage payoff vs dividend investing,"TL;DR - Pay off mortgage = true wealth long term. Not pay off mortgage but invest = more $ up front if we have a prolonged bull market and asset prices keep going up.

\---------  
Hi All. I get see a lot of posts, and I get asked often ""is it better to pay off my house with a lump sum, then invest that mortgage amount each month, or to invest in dividends and use those payments to help pay off the house"".

I ran the financials on a few scenarios and the general consensus is this:

In terms of raw, wealth creation paying off the mortgage and investing the mortgage amount each month creates a higher number. Ie you have more positive NET WORTH and you have more true ""money/wealth"". However, the net-present-value of your networth takes a hit. This is because money now is worth much more than money in the future.

**Take away;  if you want future value, and strong real wealth, pay off your mortgage and invest.**

In terms of present value of your money, and your view of the future in terms of real estate prices, stock market prices, inflation etc, then NOT paying off your mortgage and investing the money provides more value right here right now, and LESS real wealth over time. Over the same period of time you have a lower net worth and are much more sensitive to changes in the market/prices/rates/etc.

**Take away: if you believe in ""up only"" for the duration of your mortgage then do not pay off your mortgage but invest the money.**

The ""right"" decision is one has to make for themselves and there are many ethereal factors, such as risk appetite, known-unknowns, unknown-unknowns, ""what happens if I lose my job"", sickness, un-forseen life changes etc. 

The route I advise and the route I personally took, is to pay off the debt, and I use that monthly amount to invest into my dividend portfolio. I am pretty risk averse, and my plan is to leave everything to my children for generational wealth.

Happy to hear other peoples thoughts and to discuss further.",2,34,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nwnzek/mortgage_payoff_vs_dividend_investing/,new,Discussion,0.54

1nwm5ni,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 21:32:31,Investment Advice,"Sorry for the length but Pretty much the title.
Recently my grandfather passed. It’s been really hard. My grandma just mailed me a check from money that was left from the fund he was using to go on trips with her the past decade. It’s several thousand. I’m in my mid 20s and have never been able to save for shit. I’ve never possessed more than several hundred maybe a thousand at any moment except for the stimulus check. That’s the most I’ve ever had. And I splurged it on dumb shit since it hit my bank account while I was on a cross country road trip vacation with a friend since I went on the trip only having like $500 and it was pretty rough haha. 

Anyways, if left to my own devices it’ll slowly widdle away over the next few months between bills and small shit that adds up. Note, I never make big purchases even when it saves money long term due to feeling anxiety about spendigg by money. So, for example, I’ll end up spending $5 here and $10 there until it ends up being several hundred over the course of a month. I’ve been needing to get stuff for the past year. I’ve wanted to get a new microphone and headphones and audio interface for my studio (I make music on the side, but it’s not a necessity which is why I haven’t been able to save for it) and I haven’t been able to save up enough to take a trip to see my friends since I moved almost 4 years ago, and it’s been lonely not having any friends here. I wasn’t able to see them last year. So I want to do that this month when everyone gets together for the Halloween party.
 
So to put it frankly I want to learn how to invest my money in a way that will earn money quickly. I don’t want to use any of it. So I don’t mind putting like $2k in some long term fund. But I know with stocks you put in $500 and after 5 years you have $550, and even tho it is assured profit I don’t want to waste it sitting around for years just to make 5% interest. I want to invest it wisely in ways that can make money fast. Double in in a few months kinda fast. Turn $5000 into $6000 within a month so I can see my friends speed. 

I know there’s no real get rich quick scheme, and Ik there’s no easy money methods. But I do know there are ways to make money fast IF you already have a sizeable chunk of money to work with. Which I previously didn’t have. It’s hard to start investing when $10 invests to $15 over a few days or whatever. But if you do the same with $1000 that’s $1500. $5000 that’s $7500. 

I just don’t know where to start or what to do. I don’t want to fuck this up like everything else I do. I want to use this to change my future. 
 
If I can turn $5000 into $10000 that’s not just getting my wants. That also can pay the few thousand it costs to go back to college and get my pre-reqs to get into my local technical colleges surgical tech program to start earning my degree for a good paying job. I know I can do it. I just need help. Please. 🙏🏻 
Thank you so much. Hell if any of you have a sure fire method I’d even pay you commission on my first profits if it works LOL.

\--------------------------------------------  
  
Kraft Heinz announced on September 2, 2025, that it will split into two separate publicly traded companies by the second half of **2026**. 

* One company, temporarily named **Global Taste Elevation Co.**, will focus on sauces, spreads, and shelf-stable meals, including brands like Heinz, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, and Kraft Mac & Cheese.
* The other company, temporarily named **North American Grocery Co.**, will focus on grocery staples, including brands like Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables.

\--------------------------------------------

<snippet from Forbes article, linked>

While the market sees potential for significant value creation if Kraft Heinz’s North American division achieves a meaningful turnaround, the current low single-digit growth expectations suggest it may not justify the approximately $20 billion valuation being attributed to it. However, RemainCo could benefit from a valuation uplift, given its portfolio of high-growth businesses.

Kraft Heinz’s restructuring mirrors a broader industry shift, similar to Kellogg’s 2023 split into Kellanova and WK Kellogg, which helped both companies grow independently. Since then, Kellanova’s stock rose 50.7%, WK Kellogg gained 72.1%, while Kraft Heinz’s shares dropped by 17.5% during the same period. Kraft Heinz has already demonstrated a willingness to pare down its portfolio through the divestment of non-core units, such as its Italian infant nutrition division, signalling that the potential spin-off is part of a larger recalibration of its brand ecosystem. With both Berkshire Hathaway stepping back from board involvement and 3G Capital having exited its stake by the end of 2023, it becomes easier for Kraft Heinz to take a bold step, such as a spin-off.",7,10,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joecornell/2025/09/08/kraft-heinz-to-split-into-two-companies/,new,Discussion,0.77

When a company pays out a dividend, something interesting happens to its stock price—it should fall by about the same amount as the dividend itself.

At least that’s how things normally work but in my opinion this logic does not apply to **beaten down stocks** that pay out a nice dividend. It’s my experience that these types of stocks do not fall by about the same amount of the dividend itself because they are considered cheap due to an underlying risk that usually relate to a lot of recent or current headwinds. 

$TGT is a good example. $KSS before it recovered some is another good example (up nearly 200% since April). ",0,8,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nvyxyn/beaten_down_divvy_stocks_and_the_hunt_for_free/,new,Discussion,0.42

I doubt it will continue at this pace, but it's totally possible. And, speculating here, but I think there is a good chance ETH runs to $6k or even $8k by EOY / Q1 2026. Which could give a strong NAV boost and prevent decay for that much longer.

Yeah, it's probably equally as risky as yieldmax funds, but if you agree with the potential eth gains, it could be a money machine for a while. There's even an outside chance that eth and crypto have a multi year rally, which could really make this a cash cow. I guess worst case scenario is like 50% downside in the near term.

1nva0ve,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 10:39:54,JEPI vs SPYI: Which Do You Like?,"Been comparing JEPI and SPYI lately since they both show up a lot when people talk about income ETFs. On the surface they look similar (covered call strategies with big yields) but the numbers and portfolios tell a different story from my analysis.

I created a hypothetical portfolio on Dividend Watch with $10k invested in both to get a sense of total returns, and other details my broker lacks for these securities.

[$10k comparison, including annual income differences](https://preview.redd.it/9bwoykqxhisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=50788313ebc101ae492cbadb2765eb6cfb9e044a)

If you had put $10K into each a year ago, the results aren’t the same. JEPI would have thrown off about $812 in income with an 8.4% yield, while SPYI would’ve paid closer to $1,200 with an 11.7% yield. Total return was also stronger for SPYI over that stretch.

Looking at dividends, JEPI’s story hasn’t been great. Payouts dropped from $6.36/share in 2022 to about $3.21 this year. That’s a downward trend that makes me cautious. SPYI, on the other hand, is newer but has been ramping up. It paid $1.89 in 2022, jumped to $5.79 in 2023, hit $6.12 in 2024, and even though 2025 is tracking lower at $4.04, the overall trajectory is still more encouraging than JEPI’s slide.

The holdings explain a lot. JEPI spreads things out — tech is its biggest sector but only around 20%, with healthcare, financials, and industrials right behind. SPYI leans more heavily into growth names: tech is over a third of the fund (34%), and then financials, consumer cyclical, and comm services make up most of the rest. It’s more tilted toward the S&P’s heavyweights.

[SPYI breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/ex8u2sr0iisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bd03a41f4bd3dcddbd969615cb16c6130c382c0)

[SPYI dividends](https://preview.redd.it/nhkhktr0iisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=215955f04f63c47077fb5269e4a2efc625291e8d)

[JEPI breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/35ufctr0iisf1.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=65c196905bc91a6058b620e0bd8fa8eaf6e3cbc5)

So the trade-off looks something like this:

* JEPI is the more established, diversified option, but its shrinking payouts are a red flag.
* SPYI is newer and a bit more aggressive, with higher yield and stronger recent results, though its dividend history isn’t as long and the 2025 dip shows it won’t always be smooth sailing.

Trying to figure out what I’d like to own in which account. I’ve read some people saying dividend ETFS (like SCHD) are great to have in a Roth, but this seems counterintuitive to me. I would think growth ETFs would be better off in the Roth since growth is tax free anyway and dividend ones would be better in the brokerage account since the dividend payment are treated as qualifying long term investments and not income. Wouldn’t the tax advantages of dividend payments be “wasted” in a Roth where I’m not paying taxes anyway?

Additional point regarding SCHD, the dow jones index is comprised of companies actually *making physical products*, meaning there is exposure to tariffs.

Today closely checked BIZD holdings because PBDC is like actively managed and has more or less good BDCs with distributions in 5-10% range. So I've checked BIZD. And what the trick with bond allocation? 25%??? Is it normal for this fund? Does someone remember? I've tried to use Wayback Machine and see that few months ago it was more or less similar. Why they are doing this? At first i thought they raised cash to buy smth cheaper but it's passive fund, even active manage PBDC not doing this. I thought maybe it's to reduce volatility but it fell more than PBDC that don't have bonds at all (0.5 to 5%). So again why they are doing this? If they would convert this cash to every other BDC except of arcc and obdc as they already have giant position there they probably even get more yield (every bdc yields more than 4% tBill). So either I am missing smth very obvious like novices confuse \~14% expense ratio or it's just bad etf. Because I can buy on my own arcc+obdc+main+tBill. So anyone has some ideas? Thanks

If the underlying indexes have a big recovery rally, how much will the cc funds actually participate in that upside and recover as well if you aren't dripping the dividends?

I plan on investing another 1500 next month (Taxable brokerage), 100 in an automanaged taxable brokerage just to see how well it does and if the returns beat my portfolio, and 30 in a roth ira containing 65% VTI and 35% VXUS. The roth ira contributions are small because i want to retire at a young age to enjoy my money and my life. I know that may not be realistic but im going to try my best.

I'm making this post because in my current growing portfolio i have a 50/35/5/5/5 split for Growth/qualified tax dividends/stability(Bonds)/Nonqualified dividends(like YMAX or Jepq)/Speculative.

My understanding is that some of the ETFs have grown so large, that they wouldn't be able to get all the options needed through exchanges.  Or, in some cases, the premiums are too low on exchange options, so they seek out these other arrangements.

1nsmj8i,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 08:00:06,ChatGPT is too generic for investment analysis,"I've been trying to use ChatGPT for investment research but keep hitting the same wall - it gives balanced, generic responses instead of how real investors actually think, plus it doesn't have access to current financial data.

For example, if I ask about Tesla:

  \- ChatGPT: ""Here are pros and cons to consider..."" (using outdated info)

  \- What Charlie Munger would probably say: ""Multiple kill-switches triggered - current debt ratio 2.1x, ROE dropped to 8.2%, avoid immediately""

The problem is ChatGPT is trained to be helpful and neutral, but legendary investors have strong opinions and specific methodologies. Plus it can't access real-time financials or recent news.

So I had this idea: what if someone built AI specifically trained on individual investors with live data integration? Like you could actually chat with:

  \- ""AI Charlie Munger"" using his kill-switch framework + current financials

  \- ""AI Warren Buffett"" applying his moat analysis + recent earnings

  \- ""AI Peter Lynch"" with his growth methodology + latest news

Even better - imagine a ""board meeting"" feature where all three analyze the same stock using current data and you see where they agree vs. disagree.

Key features I'm thinking:

  \- Real-time financial data (earnings, ratios, cash flow)

  \- Recent news integration and sentiment analysis

  \- Opinionated takes based on actual methodologies

  \- Multiple investor perspectives on same stock

  \- Portfolio upload for personalized analysis

I'd honestly pay $25-30/month for something like this vs. fighting with ChatGPT's outdated, generic responses.

Questions:

  1. Would real-time data integration make this significantly more valuable?

  2. What would you pay for specialized AI with live financial data vs. generic tools?

  3. Which legendary investors would you most want to ""chat"" with about current market conditions?

  4. Would you upload your portfolio for multi-investor analysis?

Anyone else frustrated with ChatGPT's limitations for current investment analysis?

Edit: For those asking about feasibility - the AI technology exists, and financial APIs are available.

1nskvny,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 06:24:58,Dividend investor in Europe: keep Realty Income ($O) or switch to EURO iSTOXX High Dividend Low Volatility 50 ETF?,"I’ve been dividend-investing for a bit and have held Realty Income ($O) for over a year. After digging into the tax side, I realized that in my country (Europe) dividends end up taxed at roughly \~42.5% even though the W-8BEN limits U.S. withholding to 15%.

Given that drag, I’m considering switching the position into an EU-domiciled ETF that tracks the **EURO iSTOXX® High Dividend Low Volatility 50** index to avoid the U.S. withholding and simplify taxes.

**ETF I’m looking at (example):**

* **Invesco EURO STOXX High Dividend Low Volatility UCITS ETF**
   * **Index:** EURO iSTOXX High Dividend Low Volatility 50
   * **ISIN:** IE00BZ4BMM98 — **Ticker:** EHDV (various exchanges)
   * **Structure:** UCITS, Ireland-domiciled, **distributing quarterly**
   * **Replication:** Physical, holds 50 stocks
   * **TER:** **0.30% p.a.**
   * **Fund size:** \~€202m
   * **Current dividend yield:** **\~5.2%**, last 12 months paid \~€1.57 per share (figures per justETF; date on their page Sept 2025)
   * Source: justETF profile; STOXX index page/factsheet. ([justETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BZ4BMM98))



1. For those in Europe facing high effective taxes on U.S. dividends: have you found **EU-domiciled UCITS dividend ETFs** (ideally **“reporting funds”** in your country) that deliver a **higher net-of-tax yield** than EHDV? Any favorites to compare?
2. My understanding is that **$O is a U.S. REIT/stock and not an Austrian-style “reporting fund (Meldefonds).”** If you’re in the EU/Austria, does moving from a U.S. single stock like $O to an **EU-domiciled UCITS reporting fund** materially improve your **after-tax** income?
3. Are there **better products for pure income** (e.g., other EURO STOXX/Europe high-dividend strategies, or even all-Europe high-dividend low-volatility variants) that historically offer a **higher distribution yield** than EHDV without taking on excessive risk?
4. Anything I’m missing re: **withholding tax, tax credits, or broker handling** that would change the O vs. EU-dividend-ETF calculus?

Appreciate any EU-specific experiences or portfolio examples. Thanks!",9,17,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nskvny/dividend_investor_in_europe_keep_realty_income_o/,new,Discussion,0.72

I been thinking about my financial situation.

No credit cards anymore.  19,000 invested making 120 monthly income 73,000 in student loans 30K of that is at 6.8% and the rest are MUCH lower rates around 3-4%

My plan WAS to just grow my monthly income to help cover income based payment.  I make about 45K a year and save EVERYTHING.  Rent is about 800, I own my own old Honda so its reliable with some typical repairs nothing to major.

However I have been thinking about switching my plan.  I have been investing about 800-1200 each month now as that 19K invested started the year around 4 so most of it is VERY recent growth.

Would investing in QQQI and SPYI covered calls ETF's be a win in my situation? 60 cents of monthly income on a 53 buck investment.  I was thinking next two years If I can pump 50,000 into them  THEN I will have a $600 revenue stream that I can then focus on buying SCHD 600 dollars worth every month and then turn my focus to paying down that 30K at 6.8% intrest.

What would you do in my situation.  I have great job but the pay is rather low but I live in a low cost area so it works fine for me. is covered calls ETF's to good to be true? I'm 39 now about to be 40 so I got a good 20 years before I start to retire by going part time. likely will always keep working to some extent cause getting paid to move my body is a good thing I'd say.. even if it's part time in my 70's if I live that long I still want to be bringing in income but I don't want to wait until im 55 to start investing.. idk.. am I doing it wrong? Can't change the past and not get this scam of a degree but what is done is done..

1nrfd7k,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 18:49:06,Advice for 20yr old college student investing with the intent of paying off school,"I’m a 20 (21 soon) year old year sophomore in college who’s gaining monthly income from government benefits. Very fresh and green into investing but I’ve been trying to learn as much as I can recently.

The benefits have been very useful to have during school since I can’t fit in a job without sacrificing a lot of time. However these benefits are only active during the school year. I want to start investing as early as possible to help build long term wealth, but my primary goal is to help pay off school loans. Those loans being priced around $60k not taking into account interest, which fortunately is low. I’m graduating June of 2028. I’m going to school for art , my current career trajectory is looking like becoming a freelancer in editorial and children’s books.

I thought about dividends mostly for the fact that they’d be able to help during times I’m not receiving income during summer (family reasons), which would allow me to DRIP during that time so I’m at least putting in something rather than nothing.

With that being said, I’d be able to invest $200 a month during the school year... September through December, and January through end of April. I’ve been thinking about putting $100 into VOO as a solid foundation for long term sake starting with a growth ETF, then $50 into SCHD to dip my toes in but I’ve heard people on this subreddit saying that’s better for retirement. With the last $50 I thought about putting it into a company stock, maybe holding a slice of Costco.

Would dividends make sense for my personal circumstances or should I focus on a different build?I’m sorry for the noob questions but I’m at the point where I’m trying to think about my future and how rough the job market is and how that would impact me paying off my loans.

Any help, honest critique and feedback would be very beneficial. Thank u",1,1,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nrfd7k/advice_for_20yr_old_college_student_investing/,new,Seeking Advice,1.0

It seems like a good middle ground between maximizing growth, total returns and generating retirement income. Also I believe its income is more stable than the income from CC ETFs. If we look through the dividend history of SPY since inception, the dividends decreased in only 3 out of 31 years (09 being the worst at -20%, 05 -2.2%, 01 -5.5%). I assume that QDPL’s dividends (which are supposed to be 4x of S&P 500) would behave same way though I don’t fully understand future contracts to be 100% confident about that. What would be the risk in a retirement strategy with QDPL as the core holding?  
For example: 90% QDPL, 10% Bonds / Cash for those occasional ~1/10 years when dividends decrease. The high/ish expense ratio could be offset by reduced bond  exposure. No need to sell any shares but occasionally when market does really well, you could rebalance or sell some shares to get back to 90/10 (or other desired allocation).

1npkv65,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 15:01:57,When should I change my strategy from growth to dividends,"Hey there, straight to the point but I am not the type of person willing to invest in dividend stocks his entire life for some reasons that I'll explain so I would like to know if there's an ""optimal age"" to change strategies. Let me explain my reasoning.

Okay dividend stocks are safer because they are usually more stable companies (longer track record of being profitable, dividend kings are not a thing for no reason I guess). But they offer less growth opportunity, so my current plan is going all in on growth stocks until the age of 40 something then progressively transfer my portfolio to dividend stocks but I would like to get your reasoning because I did some calculations and I don't understand dividend-only people's reasoning (not to criticize, maybe I am the one who's wrong) as the average growth promoted by growth-investors is 10%/year but dividends people tend more to talk about a realistic 6% growth per year + 2% dividends on their side.

So my calculations started there, suppose I invest 100$ a month during 7 years only, the difference is already big:

\- 100$ in growth stocks at 10% yearly growth: [Calculation for growth portfolio](https://www.dunefolio.com/calculator?starting_capital=10000&growth_rate=10&dividends_rate=0&duration=84&monthly_investment=100&yearly_investment=0)

\- 100$ in dividend stocks at 6% yearly growth + 2% dividends: [Calculations for dividends portfolio](https://www.dunefolio.com/calculator?starting_capital=10000&growth_rate=6&dividends_rate=2&duration=84&monthly_investment=100&yearly_investment=0)

Which ends up with 25,000$ for the dividends portfolio and 28,000$ for the growth one.

And I mean you don't even need advanced math, the yearly return is just 10% vs. 8%, the calculation only highlights the gap.

Indeed my point is I don't get it, what is the ultimate advantage to being 'dividend only'. Thanks for your answer and good luck on your investing journey ;)",1,23,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1npkv65/when_should_i_change_my_strategy_from_growth_to/,new,Discussion,0.54

I will try to get unemployment for a little while but once I have the surgery and am not physically able to work I believe that will disqualify me at that point.  I don’t have significant savings to fall back on but between a severance payment and some savings I will have about 40-50k.

I figure I could make about 1500 a month work if I lived extremely frugally so I need that 40-50k to generate at least 1000 a month for a few months to a year.

1npj6lr,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 13:58:51,ROTH IRA vs Personal Investment Account,"Hello all, I am relatively new to investing (within the last 5 years) and currently have two portfolios - a ROTH IRA and a personal investment account. To further clarify, I am a long-term investor (am yet to sell a single share of a single stock) and view these investment accounts as my retirement fund (40ish years down the road).

After doing some more research into the tax benefits of a ROTH IRA I am now faced with this question: should I group all of dividend paying stocks (with DRIP investing) into my ROTH IRA - as I will not be taxed on any dividend payments over the next 40ish years (assuming I do not sell anything in this account till I turn 64 or whatever age the tax-break rule is amended to by then)? 

Then I would group the majority of my growth stocks into my personal investment account (no dividends = no yearly dividend taxes) - that way the only taxes I would pay in this account would be the capital gains taxes when I decide to sell a couple decades down the road?

Or does the real value of a ROTH IRA lay in the fact that capital gains aren’t taxed either (if I pick a stock that goes 50x over the next 40 years in my ROTH, I would not be taxed on any of those gains)?

Curious what you all think, majority of dividend paying stocks in my ROTH IRA? Majority of growth stocks in my ROTH IRA?

Coupling dividends with modest growth has been such a solid strategy for me to keep consistent with investing. I do not panic sell and I do not look at my portfolio everyday to see what the market is doing. 

My biggest positions are the SP500, NASDAQ100 and TSX60 with a few individual companies and covered call ETFs. All positions are attached. 

My goal for now is honestly maintaining a 2.5% yield and getting out of individual companies slowly. Yeah sure its high risk high reward, but I have realized I suck at stock picking and a 80% ETF portfolio would be great. Also getting the covered call ETF portion of my portfolio to 10% would be great. Currently its at \~12%.

I’ve been hearing so many things about benefits vs downsides of SPYI/QQQI, XYLG/QYLG, and GPIX/GPIQ. And it’s all scattered across the internet I’ve yet to find anything that breaks down the pros and cons with any sort of logic/thought train. I know they’re all high yielders but what is the “best” combo for a taxable brokerage used to supplement income?

I like the Global X funds (XLYG/QYLG) but I think just because of the title “Covered Call & Growth”, implying that besides a hefty payout the funds itself appreciate in NAV. Then the QQQI/SPYI seems to have at least some of the distributions treated as ROC instead of dividends (which would be better in a non-retirement brokerage account). Then GPI Q/X just seem like copy cats of all the same covered call strategies. Ideally I’d like growth and income (wouldn’t we all) but wondering if the naming convention on the Global X funds is misleading me... 

These are just 6 examples of hundreds, I know. Because there’s also JEPQ/JEPI… 🤦🏻‍♂️ they seem to have a longer history and decent stability…. HELP.

I am a young investor (29) and am also a high income healthcare worker that earns over $300K per year combined with my wife. We are trying to create reliable passive income streams to replace our income over time without worrying about market value, 4% rule, etc. 

I understand that many investors do not like CEFs from a tax perspective, as these funds are required to pay out 95% of earnings as taxable dividends to shareholders. As a result, the market value/appreciation may be flat for a very long time. There is also leverage and fees to be aware of. 

However, I also understand that if passive income is the goal, these investments would help meet that goal as opposed to the Bogleheads “VOO and chill” approach that many financial planners recommend. 

On another note, I follow some knowledgeable investors in the CEF space like Steven Bavaria and Steve Selengut, who make the comparison to a “department store”, where you can buy CEFs at a discount and sell them for profit later on to capture some gains. This creates an additional income stream on top of the regular dividend distributions. 

Just wanted to hear others’ thoughts on these investments. ",4,18,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1noimm6/closedend_funds/,new,Discussion,0.75

In college I battled depression: partied and drank excessively to feel anything, had a bad spots gambling addiction, and lost thousands in crypto. God met me at rock bottom to hit rock bottom, and I have rebuilding from scratch. I am deployed overseas and not getting taxed while receiving extra combat incentive pay.

My first priority is to max out my IRA for 2025 and build an emergency fund while contributing 20% of my base pay toward the ROTH TSP (like the 401k for gov employees). I am adding $183/week to the IRA to ensure I max it by year's end.

Current portfolio:

IRA

* $2604 SWTSX
* $576 SWISX
* $535 SFENX

TSP - Approximately $10,000 all in the C fund (like the S&P 500)

Taxable Brokerage - $500 with some higher conviction individual stock picks.

Have a HYSA with $500 contributing $1000 a month to establish an emergency fund and earmarked for whenever my car eventually craps the bed. Also Have another $1000 in SPAXX money market account that I am not sure how to utilize.

My main question is - if the goal is to grow the portfolio as quickly as possible given the golden opportunity with low expenses, no tax, and a few hundred extra dollars a month - how should I be positioning and deploying my capital? Should I just go all into an index fund with the money in SPAXX? Should I use a robo investor or just pick something like VOO and just let it ride while DCA in? My intent is to set allotments and really just set it and forget it. Feel like the stress of checking and monitoring my investments has hurt me long term as I have made so many poor emotional decisions (like selling PLTR when it hit $15 lol).

	1.	IWMI
	2.	IAUI
	3.	IYRI

These are iShares ETFs from BlackRock, and you’re looking for the closest Vanguard alternatives. Let’s break each one down and match them:

⸻

🔹 1. IWMI – iShares MSCI World Islamic UCITS ETF
   •   Focus: Tracks the MSCI World Islamic Index, which screens for Shariah-compliant global companies (removing those involved in alcohol, tobacco, financials, etc.).

✅ Vanguard Equivalent:
   •   No direct Vanguard Islamic ETF exists.
   •   Closest available:
      •   Vanguard FTSE Developed World UCITS ETF (VEVE) – Tracks developed markets globally.
      •   But not Shariah-compliant.

⚠️ Vanguard does not currently offer Shariah-compliant ETFs. You’d have to stick with iShares or other providers (e.g., HSBC, Wahed).

⸻

🔹 2. IAUI – iShares MSCI USA Islamic UCITS ETF
   •   Focus: Tracks MSCI USA Islamic Index (Shariah-compliant U.S. stocks).

✅ Vanguard Equivalent:
   •   Closest available:
      •   Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (VUSA) – Tracks top 500 U.S. companies.
      •   Vanguard U.S. Equity Index Fund – Broader U.S. exposure.
      •   But again, not Shariah-compliant.

⚠️ No Shariah-compliant U.S. ETF from Vanguard.

⸻

🔹 3. IYRI – iShares MSCI World Islamic UCITS ETF – Dist (distributing version)
   •   This is the distributing (dividend-paying) version of IWMI.

✅ Vanguard Equivalent:
   •   Same issue: No Shariah-compliant option.
   •   Closest would be:
      •   Vanguard FTSE Developed World UCITS ETF (VEVE) – Distributing version.

⸻

✅ Summary Table

iShares ETF (You Mentioned)	Focus	Vanguard Equivalent	Notes
IWMI	MSCI World Islamic	None (VEVE is closest)	Not Shariah-compliant
IAUI	MSCI USA Islamic	VUSA / U.S. Equity Index Fund	Not Shariah-compliant
IYRI	Same as IWMI (Distributing)	VEVE (distributing)	Not Shariah-compliant

1nnz87l,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 17:30:58,Research For Success,"I mean no disrespect to anyone, but I'm amazed at how many people ask ""what should I do"" in regards to their portfolios or what they should buy or sell. 

Do the research, learn how the markets work, learn the indicators to help you make a decision, and go forward.

When I first started seriously investing for retirement when I was in my early 30s, I had no clue how the markets worked. So I started reading & learning...and this was before internet resources were available. I had our funds at a brokerage where an agent made the buying & selling decisions for us. Soon learned that the vast majority of investors made the decisions over what to buy and sell even using a firm, and I recognized I had started doing that too.

So I cancelled the managed account and transferred holdings to a discount brokerage, E-Trade. I later left E-Trade and now have been with Schwab for over 30 years, and they are great.

I haven't asked anyone for advice for over 35 years now and rely on my own knowledge, experience, and confidence on buying & selling.

When I was 36 & wife was 34, we had $5,000 to our name and were about $18,000 in debt. We are now 70 & 68 and own our home ($650k) debt free with about $1.4M in retirement accounts with $400,000 in Roths. No other debt at all.

While we both did have a 401k with our respective employers, they were immediately rolled to Schwab IRAs when we retired. We started the Roths separately.

I've made mistakes in the past and will likely make mistakes in the future, but mistakes are what you learn from and help make future success.

I implore everyone to start studying finance and investing and have the confidence in your decisions. Most of the folks posts I read in r/dividends give a lot of advice, but are wrong in the comments they make. Not everyone, as some commenters are very aware and knowledgeable, but a larger percentage are clueless.

After I left the managed brokerage, I've never listened to anyone who said...you should buy this...or...you own that!!?!...you should sell. Conversely, I've never recommended to anyone else what they should buy, even when they asked my advice. Instead, I tried to give them the tools to make those decisions themselves. 

The only advice I gave to a friend was back in 2007/8 when markets were getting ready to tank and the real estate bubble burst. I told him I sold everything and saved several $100,000 in losses. He said.. ""why didn't you tell me?"" I said, ""I did, you chose to ignore me.""  The market indicators just worried me then and I luckily made the decision to get out. It didn't take long before I did some bottom feeding and got back in. 

Once again, learn how the system works and be confident in your decisions. Don't rely on another person to qualify your decisions...be confident!!

I hit my goal of a large weekly income, so now I'm stumped on where to go, as I want to get away from weeklies, and start building a 'base' for the portfolio of steady monthly income payers, or dividend growth payers.

Basically from here where would you guys go, I'm deciding between the following:

* **Monthly Income (Funds that pay the same every month) - includes -15% withholding tax on U.S. funds:**
   * $PREF.TO (Preferred Split Corp. Fund of Funds) - 6.49% yield
   * $HDIF (Harvest Fund of Funds) - 10% yield
   * $PDIV (Non-Leverage, Dividend + option) - 12% yield
   * $PDI (Global Debt/Loans) - 11% yield
   * $YYY (Multiple Income Fund of Funds (mostly Blackrock)) - 10% yield



* **Quarterly Hikers (dividend growth companies) includes -15% withholding tax on U.S. stocks:**
   * $OZK (Financial | hikes: 1,4,7,10) - 2.8% yield (each hike: +2%)
   * $HESM (Midstream | hikes: 2,5,8,11) - 7% yield (each hike: +1-4%)
   * $EQB.TO (Financial | hikes: 3,6,9,12) - 2.3% yield(each hike: +3-5%)

Honestly, I just like these, but the increase in every payout is nice to see as well.

Long story long, I was realizing that for the last six years, I was stressing myself out doing research on withdrawal methods, withdrawal rates, how to adjust withdrawals in an up market and the down market and learning about all of those methodologies, asset, allocation, bonds, sequence of withdrawal risk, etc. Every time I did research, I wanted to tinker and adjust my portfolio based on a new philosophy, and I’m getting really tired of it.

I have to open my portfolio every time I want to sell my stocks to make a withdrawal and that just encourages me to tinker. It’s just my personality. I can’t do anything about it. This also encouraged me to react to the market because I could see my entire network going up and down every time I open my portfolio.

A few days ago I literally just dumped my entire portfolio into two dividend ETFs because I am realizing how much I value simplicity and I want to set up my investments like basically a set it and forget it trustfund that pays me every month. I will also be instructing my brokerage to not allow me to have online access unless I go into a physical brokerage to make it harder for me to trade. Especially seeing as I live outside of the United States and I would have to take a flight back to place a trade or adjust my portfolio.

I’m sort of looking at this like a trust fund that is being managed by the corporations who choose to pay me dividends and they adjust how much they pay me in the markets and the markets based on the health of their companies and the economy.

I wanted a simple US dividend fund and a simple international dividend fund. I tried to wait the allocation roughly with the weight of VT (total world market fund) so it’s about 60/40.

Thoughts? Knowing I want to keep things simple and tinker free. Anything inherently wrong with this? I know I could probably diversify into different sectors and this and that but again I really don’t want to do any more research. 

I just want my money to work for me and give me passive income. It’s the whole reason I wanted to save money so I never have to think about it again. 

Portfolio size is….substantial. Schwab investment income puts it at roughly $27,000/ month (before tax) and I would be okay with dividends getting cut in half for a bit so long as I know I won’t go to zero and that the income will eventually recover. Im not adding this to brag but to give context. I probably spend like $10k/month on myself. The rest goes into savings for fun spending. So in down years I would just cut down on some of the fun and luxury.

I’m relatively new to dividend investing and am looking for some feedback.

I’m just looking to build an additional little portfolio on the side with $100 a month and drop the dividends back into the same funds.

1nle0or,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 16:07:48,Seeking UK Investment Advice: Growth vs. Dividends with £1k + £200/month,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some guidance on structuring my investments and would appreciate this community's perspective.

I’m based in the UK and use the Trading 212 platform (Stocks ISA Account). I have a £1,000 lump sum to start with and can commit to investing around £200 monthly afterwards. I’m currently holding 136 shares of PFLT with a monthly dividends of £8.50 roughly.  

My main dilemma is deciding on a strategy. I'm torn between focusing on high-growth stocks or targeting high-dividend stocks for potential income. As a UK investor, I've also noticed that some popular dividend ETFs (like some US-based ones) aren't available to me, which has made the decision harder.

Has anyone else been in a similar position? I'd be grateful for any advice on:

1.  How to think about the growth vs. dividend decision for a long-term portfolio.
2.  Specific UK-friendly ETFs or investment trusts (on Trading 212) that are good for either strategy.
3.  Any other general tips for making the most of this starting plan with regular contributions.

1nl4p4v,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 10:13:02,Dividend Tracking Apps Ranked [Updated],"I while back I made a post ranking all of my favorite dividend tracking apps and got tons of recommendations in the comments of amazing dividend tracking apps i've never tried before. So, I thought I would do a revisit to the list and update it after trying out all of the new apps I was recommended.

So here is my list of top dividend and portfolio tracking apps ranked...

[https://snowball-analytics.com/](https://snowball-analytics.com/) \- 8/10 - Really good if you want more in depth analytics on your computer, but the mobile version isn't my favorite and their premium version feels a little overpriced.

DivTracker (the palm tree one) - 7/10 - I like this one because its free and pretty generous, but its the only one with ads which you can pay to have removed. It has all the analytics and features you'd expect and feels good on the phone. Link: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dividend-tracker-stock-market/id1564179613](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dividend-tracker-stock-market/id1564179613)

[https://thedividendtracker.com/](https://thedividendtracker.com/) \- 0/10 - I downloaded the mobile version and could not figure out for the life of me how to add stocks to the portfolio, you might need to do it on the web version, idk

[https://divtracker.app/](https://divtracker.app/) \- 7/10 - This one is just a super solid and robust choice, they don't have anything fancy, but it does what it does super well and the premium version is a good deal.

[https://stockevents.app/](https://stockevents.app/) \- 9/10 - This has been a long time favorite of mine. I really like how they did their mobile app, it feels very polished and high quality. I also like their web version a ton. Great app especially if you want to track all the different dividend events (such as earnings, ex dates, and more). The only thing holding it back is there was no brokerage linking for the paid version and you could only set one goal at a time.

[https://plainzer.com/](https://plainzer.com/) \- 7/10 - There is no IOS version of the app that I could find and the android version felt a bit basic, but the web version was very clean and had all the features you'd expect from a good dividend tracking tool.

[https://trackyourdividends.com/](https://trackyourdividends.com/) \- 6/10 - No mobile version at all and the web version is pretty basic, not that being super basic is bad, it does have a very clean and minimalistic view that feels nice to look at.

[https://delta.app/en](https://delta.app/en) \- 7/10 - I have only tried their mobile app and thought it was really good, it is more of a general portfolio tracker, less focused on dividends but still really solid choice.

[https://divstash.app/](https://divstash.app/) \- 10/10 - This app is newer, but this is my new favorite tracking app. It feels a lot like Stock Events, but the premium version comes with brokerage linking. Also because I am a super goal oriented investor I really enjoy how they let you create multiple super customized goals for your portfolio. Its also run by just one guy so its really impressive what he has done. (They also just added it to Android)

There were other options that I also tried out but none of them were really good enough to be added to the list.

TL;DR Same result as last time: [https://divstash.app/](https://divstash.app/) and [https://stockevents.app/](https://stockevents.app/) are my personal favorite apps with DivStash being better for me because of highly customizable goals and automatic portfolio tracking, the only reason I would go with another option would be if you want super in depth portfolio analytics on the web version then I would go with [https://snowball-analytics.com/](https://snowball-analytics.com/)

(All the apps are free too)

Again these are all just my opinions after trying each app.

So [https://divstash.app/](https://divstash.app/) is my winner, but I am curious what you guys think.",74,43,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nl4p4v/dividend_tracking_apps_ranked_updated/,new,Opinion,0.94

Right now it's just in a MMF earning 4% which is about 450 a month.

At 100k into qqqi it would generate roughly 14k a year in dividends. I'd like to preserve capital as much as possible if I did need to sell shares for cash to pay off the heloc.  It's also possible I may sell my house in the future in which case the heloc would get paid off anyway.

Curious if anyone has any thoughts on this or has done something similar.  If I didn't need the cash at all I would just stick it in an index fund and call it a day but I'm just trying to find a way to make the payments to free up cash for other wants/needs. 

I guess the other argument would be to pay off the heloc and if I needed cash I could always just borrow from the heloc.  It's nice having the cash in my account though. ",4,20,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1nkvvgg/heloc_and_qqqi/,new,Discussion,0.64

1nkch3r,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 12:08:41,JEPI vs JEPQ Detailed Breakdown,"Been digging into JEPI and JEPQ the past few days since they’re some of the most talked about covered call ETFs right now. Both kick out high yields, but once looking closer, they’re built pretty differently.

I built a hypothetical portfolio in Dividend Watch to run some numbers that my broker doesn't really provide, and there are some interesting takes.

On yield alone, JEPQ looks like the winner. It’s paying around 10.7% right now ($6.08/share annually), compared to JEPI at about 8.4% ($4.78/share). But the payout history flips the story a bit. JEPI’s income has been trending down. It was paying $6.36 back in 2022 and it’s tracking closer to $3.21 so far this year. JEPQ’s gone the other direction, climbing from $3.85 in 2022 to a little over $6 annually today. So JEPI feels like it’s slipping, while JEPQ’s been showing some growth.

The portfolios explain a lot of the difference. JEPI spreads things out: tech is the biggest slice at about 20%, but healthcare, financials, and industrials are all in that same ballpark. It feels more balanced, like a fund designed not to swing too wildly if one sector struggles. JEPQ is basically a concentrated Nasdaq income play. Over half of it is tech, and then another 30% is tied up in communication services and consumer cyclical. If tech’s hot, you’re golden. If not, you’re going to feel it.

So the trade-off seems pretty clear:

* JEPI = diversified and steadier, but the shrinking payouts raise questions.
* JEPQ = higher yield and actual dividend growth, but it’s a much bigger bet on tech.

I can see the case for holding both, but personally I’m leaning toward JEPQ if I’m chasing income and JEPI if I want something a little less tied to Nasdaq performance.

1nk4xlt,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 06:47:19,Dividend Growth vs High Yield — Are We Underestimating the Long-Term Power of Yield on Cost?,"Lately, I've been running long-term projections comparing dividend growth strategies with high-yield income plays, and I keep hitting an interesting paradox. Most people warn against chasing high yields, saying it's better to focus on companies with lower current yields but strong dividend growth.

But when I model this using yield on cost  and reinvested dividends, compounding from even modest growth rates completely flips the script over multi-decade timeframes.

Here's what I keep seeing:

\-High-growth dividend stocks (7–10% CAGR) usually start at 1–2% yield and trade at rich multiples.

\-High-yield stocks (6–9%) usually have flat or zero growth, but give me immediate cash to reinvest elsewhere.

\-Assuming full reinvestment, the closest point in my models between these two strategies is often around years 12–15.

So my core question is:

Are we underestimating the long-term power of YOC and dividend growth compounding, or overestimating the risk of high-yield sustainability?

I’d love to hear from other dividend-focused investors:

\-How do you model this trade-off between current yield and future dividend growth?

\-Does anyone currently run long-term (20+ years) backtests comparing DGI vs high yield portfolios?

I-s a “hybrid” portfolio (3–4% initial yield + 5–6% growth) the sweet spot, or just a compromise that underperforms both?

1njrc0k,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 18:29:32,"Is this etf allocation the safest, provides the highest monthly yeild, and with limited to no NAV erosion?","I will keep it brief. It is very hard to find the optimal etf mix that pays monthly dividends, limited to no NAV erosion, and pays a high yeild. 

By thier nature, covered call strategies lag the market in high volatility months, and that's what makes them lose their NAV value in the long term.

Dividends etfs have quality holdings, but all have poor yeilds (IDVO and DIVO mix are the highest yeild that pay monthly, yet they are still very low considering 30% tax on the dividends for people in my situation).

Thus, I present the below allocation as this etf allocation, in my view, is the safest, provides the highest monthly yeild, and with limited to no NAV erosion:

- HIGH 50% (80% of NAV is in treasury bills, the strategy uses options to increase the yeild) - yeild is around 7%
- SBAR 25% (barrier strategy, set at 30% below the market price on the put option date, the risk of breaking the barrier is 6% as per Simply, which is low) - yeild is around 10% 
- SPYI 12.5% (covered calls on S&P, it performed very well since Inception and expected to sustain its NAV long term) - yeild is around 11.7%
- XV 12.5% (similar strategy to SBAR, but the target yeild is 15% which is the fixed part of the equation while the barrier level is the variable, risker but worth the risk) - yeild is around 15%

The weighted average yeild is 9.3%. Even after interest rates drop to normal levels, the yeild would not be lower than 8% while half of the portfolio is in treasuries, 25% has a deep spot rate that makes it very low risk, and the rest (25%) is linked to S&P and broad market indexes (NASDAQ, S&P, and Russle 1000).

These etfs are very recently established, and we do not know how will they perform long term.

Invested about 18K and now have a projected income of 115! I been investing a lot recently so actual gains are much lower given recent investments.

My goal is to have 50 positions all with 2%  however REITS and ETF's are already diversified so likely will progress towards a 50-60 in ETF's and REITS while the rest in individual stocks each with around 2%.

TGT I thought was a great value under 100 so I loaded up higher and I really love SPG busniness which is why I went heavy with them..

It's a newer account so im not to worried about being exactly balanced, but as I build it to 100K I want to get closer and closer to it being well balance and at the correct percentages.

Recently unloaded PSEC and HRZN will be deleting them off the list for 2026 and reorganzing it better as well. Lots of additions this year so it does look a bit messy. Percentages are listed on the left side.

I am 40 so I plan on building it over the next 20 years and in that time will consider going down in hours to 32 hours and after 60 might see about even fewer hours and more PTO and days off.

Plan is to go for high divd return with SOME divd growth stocks but overall will plan on taking out max of 80% divid income and keep reinvesting 20% to keep the income growing to keep up with rising costs. but yea.

The positions mentioned below have alI been initiated within the past 3-5 years, with the exception of HSBC which I have only owned since April '25. I have been adding to most of the positions below during corrections — latest in April ’25.

The following 3 have been some of my favourite Total Growth dividend stocks:

**UNM: +185% (6.5% YOC)**  
Boring old insurer, very under the radar, but valuation was low and returns have been excellent.

**ABBV: +169% (8.1% YOC)**  
Big pharma cash flow machine. Humira decline was a concern but the pipeline and new drugs have carried growth.

**SPG: +130% (8.1% YOC)**  
Class-A malls and outlets. They bounced back strong after COVID and have kept raising the dividend.

And then a joker pick outside the screenshot is **RITM**, yielding 8.0% right now. I owned it pre-pandemic and took a loss, but post-pandemic it might actually be my best performer. I re-entered at $4.33 in April ’20, and most recently added 4,000 shares at $9.77 in April ’25. The quarterly dividends are remarkable and add a lot of dry powder every three months.

RITM is a mREIT with a broad engine (MSRs, credit, servicing). It can be volatile, but the dividend has held up well. I also expect a dividend increase and/or a potential spinoff of the NewRez division, which could unlock further value for investors in 2026. RITM has also structured and hedged its business intelligently, making it less sensitive to interest rate changes.

Another great dividend-paying stock which has been winning my heart lately is HSBC. I had wanted to own it for quite a while and finally bought in on April 7th during the tariff scare at $48.36 (2.2% YOC). Since then it has gone up 43%.

**HSBC** is one of the world’s largest banks with a strong footprint in Asia, the UK, and global wealth management. Rising rates and cost discipline have boosted earnings, and capital returns have improved with consistent dividend hikes and buybacks. For me it’s a solid play with global diversification, and I see further upside as they keep simplifying the business and focusing on higher-return markets.

That’s my take. I do own several other great dividend-paying value stocks, REITs and BDCs, but that’s another story.

**I would love to hear how others here would answer those two questions:**

1. **Which dividend stocks have given you the best total growth the past few years?**
2. **And do you DRIP, or not — and why?**

Here is the link to my previous post which also includes my views on DRIP, and my dividend and reinvestment strategy:

***What I don't like***: they pay a dividend and it's yielding around 8%. It seems too good to be true, as some high-yields I've seen yield around there and don't even have AA bonds. What's the catch?

Lately, I keep seeing AI investing tools claiming crazy stuff like 30% annual returns with zero effort.

Honestly, I haven’t tried any of them, because they feel more like marketing than actual investing.

I know AI can be powerful at analyzing trends better than humans, but I don’t think it’s there yet.

I like the idea behind magnifi.com what they do is speed up your research on stocks.

It won’t decide for you, but it helps you dig into information on the internet quickly and saves you time.

Other than this, I don’t trust AI to fully manage my hard-earned money.

But I also wonder: why would I pay for subscriptions when there are tons of free newsletters like Morning Brew (their investing edition)

which can give me timely analysis and cut down the time and effort I’d spend?

Personally, I like [Thevale ](https://linkly.link/2F5HO) because their analysis is 60% visual, so it’s easier for me to grasp the idea.

Let’s be honest we won’t invest in every analysis we read. That’s why I prefer their visual-first content: if I’m interested, I’ll dig deeper.

I’m curious to know how you guys feel about the future of AI, and especially how it’s being marketed.

Do you believe or trust AI to research, plan, and manage your money right now or at some point in the near future?

1ni79i5,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 23:53:30,"You have $2,500 what to buy that will pay that back in dividends the shortest time?"," Curious on your take…

Here’s Grok’s answer:

To recover your $2,500 investment through dividends in the shortest time, prioritize investments with the highest dividend yields, as the payback period is calculated as 1 divided by the yield (expressed as a decimal), assuming dividends remain constant. This ignores factors like taxes, reinvestment, or changes in dividend payments.

Based on recent data, business development companies (BDCs) and REITs offer some of the highest yields. The top option is Prospect Capital Corp. (PSEC), with a trailing dividend yield of 20.36% as of September 6, 2025. 44 This corresponds to an annualized dividend of $0.72 per share (paid monthly at $0.06 per share). To arrive at the payback period: convert the yield to a decimal (0.2036), then divide 1 by 0.2036, resulting in approximately 4.91 years.
With $2,500, you could purchase around 920 shares at the recent price of about $2.72 per share (prices fluctuate, so confirm current pricing). Annual dividend income would be roughly $509 ($2,500 × 0.2036), recovering the principal in under 5 years if dividends hold steady.

Other high-yield alternatives include:
	•	ARMOUR Residential REIT Inc. (ARR): Yield of 19.22% as of mid-September 2025. 54 Payback period: 1 / 0.1922 ≈ 5.20 years.
	•	Horizon Technology Finance Corp. (HRZN): Yield of 19.27% as of mid-September 2025. 40 Payback period: 1 / 0.1927 ≈ 5.19 years.
	•	Oxford Square Capital Corp. (OXSQ): Yield of 19.27% as of mid-September 2025. 29 Payback period: 1 / 0.1927 ≈ 5.19 years.

For a more diversified option, consider the Invesco KBW Premium Yield Equity REIT ETF (KBWY) with a yield of 9.28% as of September 2, 2025. 11 Payback period: 1 / 0.0928 ≈ 10.78 years. This is longer but may carry lower company-specific risk.

Yields can change, and ultra-high yields often reflect higher volatility or potential dividend cuts—review the latest financials before investing.

I’ve had my 457b for 10 years, but I was only throwing nickels and dimes at it. I had $7,000 in it 5 years ago when I began taking my retirement seriously. 

My Roth IRA is roughly: 25% QQQ, 25% VTI, 25% VIG, 22% SCHD, less than 2% MSFT & DGRO

My Roth 457b is roughly: 53% SV-COM (state street S&P 500), 22% V0128A (MFS International blend), 8% DFFVX, 6% LMOIX, 4% ANCFX, 3% VERIX, 1% BAGSX, BGRFX, NVLIX, and PORT (empower guaranteed portfolio)

I’ve self invested my Roth IRA, and my Roth 456b is robo invested through empower. The 457b is purely growth, they don’t offer any dividend plays. My IRA I’m balancing both growth (QQQ) and dividends (the rest). I had been running a 25/25/25/25 with QQQ, VTI, VIG, and SCHD for awhile. I bought MSFT with Schwab slices to make sure I was as close to 100% invested as I could be (you can’t buy dividends on stock slices). Lately I’ve been slightly less pleased with how SCHD has been performing and have begun adding DGRO. 

In the last 5 years I’ve also been able to buy a home, travel, eat out, etc. I’ve done all of this while pulling in roughly $100k a year. 

My plan is to retire at 60 and turn my IRA into a full dividend account and never touch the nest egg as I draw down my 457b and collect my pension. My pension is small, but I don’t have to fund it at all. It should be roughly mid $30k a year based on what I make now. 

I see a ton of people posting on here with million dollar accounts and for regular people I think it’s hard to relate. I wanted to show even working class people who are consistent can live good, and make investment gains.

I recently rejigged my dividend / Compound pie to the following

54% DGRW (core), 
10% FUSD, 
10% JEPQ, 
4% each BRK.B, MSFT, JNJ, WMT, COST,
3% each MAIN, O

Previously FUSD was at 32%, I'm just wondering if it's redundant to keep it and DGRW? I trimmed it down and added the cash to DGRW, MAIN, and O. 

JEPQ was 15% trimmed to 10% also for the same ones.

Top 10 holdings are similar but FUSD hasn't had much dividend growth and their methodologies are different.

Looking for some opinions please.

1nhm7fz,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 09:42:36,Looking to Diversify My VOO-SCHD Portfolio with Some International Flavor,"I’ve been rocking a 50/50 split between VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF) and SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF) for a while, and it’s been pretty solid. VOO gives me exposure to the big U.S. market for growth, and SCHD brings in steady dividends from companies with strong fundamentals, like solid payout ratios and consistent earnings. It’s been a nice balance for making money and keeping some income flowing, even when the market gets wild.

But lately, I’m feeling like my portfolio’s too focused on the U.S. With inflation sticking around, global politics getting messy, and U.S. stocks looking a bit pricey, I’m thinking about diversifying to spread out my risk and maybe boost my returns. I’m looking at international ETFs like VEU (Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US) or IDEV (iShares Core MSCI International Developed Markets) to add some global flavor while still keeping dividends coming in. I’d love to keep my overall yield above 2.5% after any changes.

I’m considering moving 20-30% of my money into something like VWO (Vanguard Emerging Markets) for a shot at higher growth, but I’m a bit worried about currency swings, so maybe a hedged option makes sense. From some quick math, this kind of shift could help my portfolio take less of a hit during rough patches, which sounds pretty good.
So, what do you all think? Any international dividend ETFs you’ve been liking lately? Got any favorites in developed or emerging markets? Are you doing anything specific, like focusing on high-quality or less volatile stocks, to manage risk? And how do you balance going global versus sticking with the U.S. market’s strength?

I’m a European investor (using Interactive Brokers) and I’m trying to build a simple dividend-focused ETF portfolio for cash flow. I’d especially love to hear from other **European dividend investors** since UCITS funds and tax treatment can be quite different from the U.S. market.

I’ve been looking at these three UCITS ETFs:

* **TDIV UCITS** – VanEck Morningstar Developed Markets Dividend Leaders
* **IDVY UCITS** – iShares Euro Dividend
* **SPYD UCITS** – SPDR S&P U.S. Dividend Aristocrats

All three ETFs are UCITS, which is important for EU investors, and together they give me exposure across global, European, and U.S. markets. They also pay dividends quarterly, and when combined, they provide income in six different months of the year: March, April, June, July, September, and October (with all three paying in December).

My goal is to build a portfolio that provides reliable cash flow without heavy NAV erosion, while maintaining diversification across regions and keeping things simple with just three funds.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on whether this 3-ETF combo makes sense for a dividend-focused EU investor, and if there are better UCITS dividend ETFs I should be considering.

For years my dream was simple: to save enough so that I could live off dividends. I finally reached that point – I’ve been investing through Tastytrade into U.S. ETFs (mainly SCHD and some VGT), and I’ve built up a serious portfolio.

I’m 27, married, with a little daughter. I always imagined dividends as the foundation of financial security for my family – stability during my life, and something I could eventually pass down.

I also considered real estate, but honestly? It’s not as attractive anymore. ROI is low, demographics in Poland are bad, and I don’t believe property prices will keep growing like they did in the past. That’s why I went all-in on stocks and dividends.

And then I discovered the U.S. estate tax rules. Here’s the painful part:

* As a non-U.S. resident, if I hold more than **$60,000 in U.S. assets (stocks/ETFs)**, my heirs could face up to **40% estate tax** when I die.
* It doesn’t matter that I live in Poland and already pay taxes here – the U.S. only cares that the securities are listed in America, so they treat them as “U.S. assets” and apply estate tax.
* With my current portfolio, I already fall into the **highest bracket: 40% estate tax**.
* And Poland has **no estate tax treaty with the U.S.**, so I’m fully exposed.

This hit me very hard. My biggest fear is that if something happens to me, my wife and daughter won’t just lose me – they could also lose almost half of what I’ve been building for years. It feels like they’d be robbed of the very security I wanted to leave them.

People often suggest UCITS ETFs in Europe as an alternative. But let me be blunt: **UCITS ETFs are terrible compared to the U.S. ones – much more expensive, worse in performance, and with far fewer choices.** For someone who spent years building a strategy around SCHD and similar funds, switching to UCITS feels like a huge downgrade.

I know there are ways around this (family foundations, trusts, private banking), but honestly? It hurts that my dream of living off dividends turned out to be so complicated.

👉 I’d especially like to hear from people who have actually dealt with this issue in real life – how did you solve it? Did you set up a trust, a foundation, or just accept the risk? I don't know.. maybe I should just sell everything and transfer money to European broker and buy nasdaq etf and wait, or maybe buy some real estate. Ehh.

The thing is, I want to invest my money, but I have no idea where to start. Most stock news and analysis I find online Yahoo Finance, other market reports use so much technical jargon that I often feel lost.

One resource that’s actually helped me a lot is TheValeLetter dot com newsletter about 60% of their content is visual, which makes it way easier for me to understand stock analysis and trends.

I got to the point where I just wanted to go myself, but the solo cost seemed out of reach.

I know that sounds silly and that a lot of people pay other expenses with dividends, but for me this is when it really hit me.

If I buy 50k of ULTY, the yield rate is 134%. This means that I will be making 67k per year only in dividends. Now I consider the HIGHEST possible tax bracket which is 37%. 67,000 x 0.37 = $24,790



So, I will be getting ($67,000 - $24,790) = $42,210 in dividends per year, AFTER taxes.



Let's suppose 4 years from now, ULTY goes to zero and stops paying the dividends. I would have accumulated $42,210 x 4 = $168,840



If the ULTY dividends go to zero, become shit, become unsellable, I will still have a net profit of $168,840 - $50,000 = $118,840

But please accept the premise and consider an answer. I.e. this is not asking whether there is a real estate bubble, and nor is it about to burst; it's about understanding REIT risk).

REITs pay very nice dividends/distributions, largely as required by law (some percentage of revenue has to be paid out in order to be a REIT with all of those benefits). When interest rates decline, dividend/income paying stocks should increase in value. 

But what if in addition to interest rates declining (and the reason for the decline), the real estate bubble bursts because of overpriced real estate, or a deep recession, business failures and defaults (commercial real estate), homeowners default because of unemployment, homeowners default because they really couldn't afford their mortgage in the first place (a la 2008), etc.

I am seeing may posts about making significant amount of money from dividends. As I understand dividend (qualified or not) is income. Being an income, even if you have reinvested it, won't you have pay income tax on it? Federal and may be state income tax. If you are in higher tax bracket, you may have to pay a significant amount as taxes. And this will repeat every year. Is my understanding correct? If so, won't it be better to invest in growth stocks and let that grow tax free till you sell it during your retirement when you may be on lower tax bracket?

1neegto,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 13:09:41,Advice Needed:,"Hey yall, wanted to run my upcoming scenario by everyone to get input! 

Background: 33M in MCOL city. I have a wife and a 5 and 2 year old. Wife makes 80K a year in a steady corporate job. Has about 60k in a 401K

I’ve been in the same Real Estate job for the last ten years and am reaching my breaking point. Very stressful and my boss (owner of the company) just simply isn’t a good person.  

I have about 120K in mutual funds but no 401K since my company is a small family run business. I’m about to quit my job and go get my Broker’s license and go out on my own in Real Estate. 

My wife is receiving a 400K inheritance at the end of this month. Income is our primary focus currently while I start my Brokerage. We need income to pay the bills until I get the Brokerage up and running. 

We own two single family homes that we rent out. One is paid in full and the other has a 140K mortgage on it and is worth about 205K. Both are rented with good long-term tenants. After all expenses (taxes, insurance, the mortgage on the one, etc) we cash-flow about 1,300 a month combined. But of course we’ve had some unexpected expensive Cap-Ex hit us recently so this can’t be relied upon. 

We sold another rental about 4 months ago and turned it into 100K in SPYI, 100K in QQQI, 10K in MSTY, and 10K in ULTY. That alone brings in about $3,600 a month at a 25% yield.

I know a 25% yield isn’t sustainable and want to bring it down closer to 10-12%. I’m okay with a little risk and not capitalizing on growth as income is currently our focus. 

We will have about 380K after taxes to invest and am considering the follow allocation: 

Realty Income (O): 100K (Feel strongly upcoming tax cuts while really help them)
AMLP: 50K
PBDC: 50K
UTG: 50K
JBB: 25K
GPIQ: 25K
GPIX: 25K
QDVO: 15K
IDVO: 15K
ARCC: 15K
EPD: 10K

Am I missing anything here? Any blind spots or sectors that I need to include to feel diversified? Appreciate your input!

I hear a lot of ""Dividends don't matter"" and ""You are excluding a large part of the market...blah, blah.

What I do know is that given my portfolio I'm able to utilize dividends to not only sustain my lifestyle but also Dollar Cost Average.  So when the market tanks, and it will tank,  my portfolio will drop less than the market and to be honest I hope it drops as I'll be picking up shares on the cheap and adding to my dividend payments which will increase my take home pay and my dollar cost averaging even further.  So the reduced drawdown percentage in a downturn coupled with the Dollar Cost Averaging makes way more sense to me than just about any other approach.

1neajyj,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 10:37:34,BITO Chat GBT vs GROK,"
I see that these 2 AI models have different views about what happens to BITO dividend if bitcoin doubles in price. Chat gbt originally claimed that even though BITO price could double the dividend dollar amount would be the same (so the percentage yield would drop to say 25%). GROK disagreed and expected the dividend amount to increase substantially even by 100%. So I put GROK into Chat GBT to see what it had to say to defend itself with the result below. My takeaway is if you believe the rosy scenarios painted for bitcoin it’s better to stock up now to capture the maximum $ dividend amounts rather than buying progressively as the prices rise. 


⸻

✅ Interpretation
	•	Now: With BITO at ~$20 and annual dividends around $10.60, the yield looks huge (~53%).
	•	Future A (Favorable): If Bitcoin doubles and BITO’s dividends scale proportionally, both price and payout double → yield stays the same (~53%).
	•	Future B (Less favorable): If roll costs or falling interest rates cap dividend growth, the payout rises only ~25% → yield drops (~33%).

So the key takeaway:
	•	If Grok’s view holds (Scenario A), your per-share dividend does double with Bitcoin.
	•	If my more cautious view (Scenario B) holds, distributions increase but more slowly, and yield % falls.

👉 Would you like me to extend this with a sensitivity table (showing multiple Bitcoin price increases, not just a doubling) so you can see how dividends might behave across a range of outcomes?",0,4,0,dividends,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1neajyj/bito_chat_gbt_vs_grok/,new,Discussion,0.4

1ndsj8j,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 18:41:03,How Northwest Healthcare's Dividend Slash Is Hitting Retail Investors Hard,"Hey r/dividends,

The recent dividend cut by Northwest Healthcare Properties REIT (NWH.UN) from $0.06667 to $0.03 per unit monthly has sent shockwaves through the investor community, especially for those relying on its income stream. With a hefty $3.65 billion debt load and rising interest rates squeezing their finances, NWH's move to slash dividends has left many retail investors frustrated and rethinking their positions.

From what I've seen on Reddit and other forums, the sentiment is pretty sour—some are disappointed about losing reliable passive income, while others are questioning the REIT's long-term stability, especially after its stock has tanked nearly 50% over the past decade. The sale of their UK portfolio and other assets raises more questions about future cash flow and whether the dividend will ever recover.

For those holding NWH.UN or eyeing healthcare REITs, what’s your take? Are you sticking it out, or is this a sign to pivot to other income-focused investments?

1ndl3kk,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 13:45:05,Dividend income and total return are NOT always interchangeable,"I keep trying to have a useful discussion about dividend income during retirement, and every time, across multiple subs, it’s derailed by people saying to ignore dividends and focus on total return, because they’re effectively the same. This has even happened on this sub, where I wrongly assumed people would see through such a misunderstanding.

Either these people are wrong, or I’m misunderstanding something very fundamental. So, let’s have it out. I’ll make my argument, and people can tell me where I’m wrong, and I’ll either walk away having learned my lesson, or finally conclude that most people are just confused on this issue.

First, I want to acknowledge where I think people who make this argument are coming from and agree that they have a point in certain scenarios.

Let’s say I have two stocks, KO and Example Corp. (EXAM). KO pays a reliable dividend and EXAM doesn’t pay a dividend. Assume I’m in a tax-advantaged account, and nearing retirement but not actually in it, so we’ll ignore the tax implications for now. If EXAM and KO (including DRIP) both gain 25% in one year, it’s true that in many ways the dividend doesn’t matter. I’m still 25% richer from either one, and I can sell either stock just as easily. As I understand it, this is the point people are making when they say total return and dividends are interchangeable, so just focus on total return. In this scenario, I agree that they are interchangeable.

However, there are many scenarios where dividend income and total return have extremely different properties, and this matters a lot, and *that is the entire point of dividends*.

A personal finance example illustrates the point. Imagine you got hired for a job, and they agreed to pay you $100,000 a year. You eagerly await your first paycheck, and it never arrives. You complain to HR, and they explain, “Oh, at this company, we don’t pay in a consistent, predictable way like other companies. We pay you in random amounts at unexpected intervals. Some days you may receive a check for $4.63, some days you get a check for $7080.21, and some days you get nothing. But, we promise, by the end of the year, you’ll receive a total of $100,000.”

Very few people would continue working at such a place, because *consistency and predictability of cash flow is extremely important*. Many people couldn’t pay their bills that situation.

When you retire, your portfolio becomes your paycheck, so the cash flow you draw from it matters. Yes, there are many strategies for making the income smooth and predictable, and dividend payments are only one strategy. However, dividends, at least from reliable companies, have a different risk profile than other strategies, and this gives them different advantages and disadvantages.

Among highly reliable companies (say, the Dividend Aristocrats or Dividend Kings), the following is true:

1. It has never happened that half the companies in these lists suddenly quit paying dividends. Some do quit paying dividends, but it’s on the order of 1-2% on any given year.
2. It has never happened that the majority of the companies in these lists reduce their dividends dramatically in a short period of time. In fact, all of them have increased their dividends for 25 years straight, including through the 2008 recession.
3. Even if the market value of the companies gets cut in half, you still get your full dividends.
4. Over the long term, both the dividend payouts and the market value of the companies tends to grow at a rate that exceeds inflation. Therefore, if you never sell any shares, it is extremely unlikely your portfolio value will ever fall to $0.

In other words, the risk that my dividend income will go away or dramatically shrink is very low. This has been true over many decades and though many recessions.

In contrast, the following is true of the stock market in general:

1. It may dramatically (25-50%) drop in value at any time and take years to recover.
2. You may have to sell stocks while the market is down, compounding your losses.
3. If you miscalculate your safe withdrawal rate (SWR), perhaps because of a bad market early on in your retirement, you may go broke before you die.

I understand that there are ways to mitigate risk on the total return side (e.g., mixing in bonds). I agree that they are pretty good and I plan to also use them during retirement. However, they have a different risk profile. I work in risk management, and have a master’s in the subject, and different risk profiles matter, a lot.

Put simply, with dividend paying companies, your primary risk is mismanagement by leadership. With total return, your primary risk is market timing. These are not the same.

While dividend income can always be treated as total returns, total returns cannot always be treated as income without potentially locking in big losses. In other words, the interchangeability only reliably goes one way.

Large companies understand this, and that’s why they pay dividends despite the tax disadvantages. Institutional investors understand this, and that’s why they demand dividends despite the tax disadvantages. Every investor should understand this, so they can make an informed decision about which risks they are most comfortable taking.

1ndi9i3,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 12:02:21,VUSD and FUSD,"Hi,

I'm looking to make changes to my portfolio. Looking at FUSD, I originally got it as an alternative for SCHD in the UK, but looking at the top holdings, it's quite similar to VUSD. Just with a slightly higher dividend yield, and slightly lower growth rate. Is there any reason to hold both?

|ETF|Top 10 Holdings (approx.)|Combined Weight|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**VUSD**|NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, GOOG, BRK.B, TSLA|\~38.0%|
|**FUSD**|NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AVGO, JPM, V, LLY, MA|\~35.7%|

  Was also thinking maybe the etf holdings should be different in each of my pies too (I have one growth, one defensive, with the same % allocation in both).

Ok fair warning this post might be a little long but that’s only because I’m telling you my current situation and I’ll do my best to keep it in order. So I’m 33 years old, I work part time for a physical therapy office as an aide. I also go to school part time finishing my associates degree in liberal arts but plan on going into the radiology technologist program after i graduate. The program itself is full time only 8am-4pm and 2 years long. Meaning while I’m in the program I can’t really work while in the program other than working the 5 hour Saturday shift my job has. 

 I have a savings account that I don’t have access to until my mom passes on that has $40k in it. This is my emergency savings account that I got when I was a minor thinking that I’d have access to the money when I came of age turns out that’s not the case. So that’s in the background for later on in life.

Now onto the money. I’ve been working at my job for 6 years, I have a 403b plan with employer matching, as of last year I started putting the money in the Roth 403b (same account just now it’s being taxed). I also switched it over a little over a month ago from the target date fund, to the s&p500 fund for better gains but sadly my 403b doesn’t earn any dividends. I have 10% being taken out per check going to this. In total my 403b is worth $44,014 as of the time of this post. 

Last year I opened up my Roth IRA in mid July 2024, and started putting $120/ check into it. I have my Roth with vanguard. My primary focus, given that Vanguard doesn’t offer fractional shares other than with Vanguard products, is that I would put as much of the $120 into SCHD that I could buy and then any money that’s leftover I put into VOO. Currently I have been able to consistently buy 4 shares of SCHD and about 0.01/0.02 shares of VOO. I have just recently sporadically been buying shares of SCHG here and there. Currently I have:

SCHD shares 156.424 ($4,292.27)
VOO shares 2.422 ($1,444.72)
SCHG shares 20.004 ($619.92)

For a total of $6,357.32

My goal is to buy and hold forever and live off of the dividends, hense SCHD being my primary focus. But this is my dilemma, lately I’ve been reading peoples posts on here about focusing on growth and then transfer to dividends later. My position in SCHD has finally gotten to the point where the quarterly dividends are large enough that it can buy 1 full share of the ETF when I get them. I don’t know if I should continue to invest primarily in SCHD as my focus since once i eventually get into the radiology program (which should hopefully be next year) I won’t be working as much and if I should focus on getting those dividends as large as possible to carry the weight for when I have to stop contributing for 2 years. Or should I switch over to SCHG as my focus and have the leftovers go into VOO since I’ll be missing out on growth and I can switch it over to SCHD later on in life? My ideal goal would be to life off of $100,000 in annual dividends, but I know I’d need like $2.5M in SCHD to get even close to that. 

So I’m hoping that by the time I retire, with the money in my 403b, the savings account I don’t have access to yet, social security, and my Roth IRA that all of that combined will be enough that I can retire comfortably even if it’s not $100,000 in annual dividends. 

What are your guys thoughts on my current situation? What would you do if you were put in my situation? Should I continue DCA in SCHD with leftovers into VOO or should I switch my focus to SCHG? Also keep in mind that once i eventually become a radiology technologist I’ll be making more money and I can afford to contribute more later on, hopefully enough to make up for the 2 year gap that I missed out on.

I recently sold a rental property, but still have 2 others. I want to generate a robust income stream that will grow over time.

I also have some funds in 401k that I’m not touching yet but they are there as an emergency break the glass type option.

My thinking is that if there is a pullback and my portfolio is well diversified enough (and has some cash or bonds on the side) I would still have room to buy the dip. What are some investments that I could add that are not strongly correlated to what I already have ? I was thinking about gold but that doesn’t pay a dividend (unless using a CC fund). Also considering CEFS (the etf) and FSCO ? Or other safer ways to invest in credit? I would love to hear some feedback.

Have $70k sitting in a cash account making 4%.  This isn't earmarked for emergency or retirement. Maybe something in the middle - if I casually come across a piece of property or want a shiny new toy

Came across qqqi and thought it might be a good alternative.  The idea is that the principal could still be liquidated for a larger purchase, but in the meantime have it cashflow a few more bucks to enjoy guilt free hobbies/weekend getaways.

I 100% get the price of qqqi falling so I'd be exposed to that - but rationally I just wouldn't sell at that time ( maybe buy more?)

My napkin math says it should pay 3x what I'm making on the cash account after taxes and fees.

So first - is the math correct?

Am I correct in saying if I paid $53/share and a year later I sell at $53 a share - thats a wash ( no tax implications) and really no different that pulling out my principal, just like I would on the money market account?

Am I missing anything ( like is the tax situation better or worse than what I'm thinking?

Better alternatives?

napkin math on $70k

|Investment|Gross Monthly|After-Tax Monthly (est.)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Money Market (4%)|$233|**$177**|
|QQQI ETF (\~14% yield)|$817|**$590**|

Edit : Re-highlighting this cash isn't set aside for emergencies - I have a separate account with 2 years expenses already filled for that.  I guess if there was an emergency with a greater need, I'd probably be tapping in to more buckets than just this one.

  
Edit 2: Decided on putting $25k in to QQI - figured that can get me close to the current dividends of the entire $70k the money market ( about $200 /month) , and will look in to some of the other suggestions to place the remaining $45k :-) I agree with spreading it out a bit or even holding it in cash longer for a deal to come up.

1ncljm0,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 11:10:38,JEPI vs GPIX maybe SPYI,"I’ve been following this thread for a while, and the more I learn, the more I realize how much I don’t know.

First: I’ve noticed a big divide when it comes to MSTY. Some people point out the steady NAV decline, while others don’t seem to care as long as their dividend income outweighs their initial cash outlay.

Second: A lot of people here seem to like JEPI. I was considering it for a portfolio I’m building, but when I looked at the NAV chart, it honestly left me a little discouraged.

Third: I recently came across GPIX. It looks like it has a lower expense ratio and a different mix of assets compared to JEPI. It seems like GPIX is at least trying to preserve NAV, though maybe it’s not as defensive. SPYI might be another option too.

What do you all think? 
Maybe if you’re in this position, share your portfolio design? This person has income from residential real estate, so I wasn’t planning any REITs.  These investments would be in an IRA for a 72yr old facing RMDs soon. He doesn’t really need the income (gets nervous if net worth declines), but I was hoping the RMDs would encourage him to start living a more plentiful life.

This hasn’t been a very loved named, and has historically traded at a discount to the HPC peers. It’s a target of a few activist fights, and management is relatively green. Back to this newer news, doesn’t a ~15% move downward seem like a lot for a brand that makes up only about 10% of revenue. And that’s for the entire population that regularly uses it, not just pregnant women. 

It doesn’t help that the science is shoddy and apparently there is no consensus among the scientific community that acetaminophen taken during pregnancy has any impact on pregnancy. Even if it does have grounding, what kind of liability would this even present?

I feel like it’s de-risked enough to be worth a lick at these levels. A lot of research reports have been published reiterating buys, with maybe slight downside to price target. It’s a leading HPC with $36B in cap, $15B in revenue, and they essentially have a top brand in every category they’re in (skincare, mouthwash, bandage, nicotine patch).

1nc2jsx,2025-09-08,2025-09-08 18:55:05,Ideas on changing my Dividend strategy,"Ok, this is a bit of an odd post for me, but I would like to hear some opinions about this before I try this out. 

To preface, I have a portfolio with about 30 stocks in it. Most are stable div stocks, some are volatile growth, and a few are terrible no good YM stocks. Today I would like to talk about those few...

I have around 10k sitting in this account. Around 2k sits in YM stocks. From that, about $600ish is in ulty.

We've been around for a while, we have seen that ulty drops constantly, however I am a dog and I want the weekly(incredibly volatile) div. My only problem is the constant loss. I don't mind a loss, but I feel like there is a better way to manage it. That brings me to my next part.

Why not just buy some shares before the ex div date, drip the div, and sell afterwards, holding whatever amount of shares afterwards. My very own modification of the dividend capture strategy. That way I can miss out on some of the weekly decline.

I understand that dividend capture is quite risky so I want to find other strategies or experienced opinions before I try it.

I want people to tell me it's bad, or good(not). But I also want to hear you opinion on WHY its bad or good. I also want to know what I should be doing instead.

Post note: Yes I fully understand that YM etfs are not sustainable. No, I don't plan on keeping them long term. I am looking to grow the position and drip into more stable etfs in my portfolio (voo, schd, schg, spyi) until they fizzle out of existence.

1nbbgbj,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 22:02:13,Pay Yourself in STOCKS instead of JUST a Paycheck!,"I came up with this awesome way to get me motivated to go into work and to invest! 

  
Each day I go into work I track my days and then I invest one share of a dividend income stock.  Right now it costs about 27 bucks for the share, it pays quarterly, however  I track it via monthly income so 8.5 cents it pays.  So for 5 days I build 42.5 cents of income that is monthly going to come back to me every single month in the future! 

  
Also I go to the gym 4 days a week typically.  So long as  go each visit I allow myself 1/2 share of stock as well so that is another 2 shares of stock so another 17 cents. So that is 59.5 cents each week I am building in endless income! 

  
52x59.5 thats 3,094 pennies or 30.94 x 10 years thats 309.4 or 618.8 for 20 years! 

  
Yes, im turning 40 this year and had I been doing this I would have been making... lets say 600 bucks ( accounting for days  I didn't work or what)  by now doing that alone!!!! I wish I understood this when I was 20 years old just starting! If you are in your 20's consider somthing like this that motivates you to keep going and building your wealth.  

  
I mean 600 bucks isn't tons to retire on but if I was in between jobs  and had 600 monthly income going 2 months without work wouldn't be a sweat at all provided I still have a nest egg of an emergency fund but yea.. 

I am also planning buying another stock one per day that costs around 5 buck but pays out 4 cents in monthly income.  If I don't buy anything for lunch and instead pack a lunch which is cheaper than buying stuff at work then I can buy another ONE share per week.  so that would help me stay motivated to eat cheaper lunches and invest another 20 cents  a week as well. 

I still do invest all my left over monthly cash into stocks to build that divd income but for those two stocks I am not going to invest in and the only way I can get more is by ""earning them"" from these rules. 

  
May seem unnessary but it is a great way to motivate me and keep me on track at work, gym, and on lunch!  Thought it be good to share as it might help others become motivated as well and change it as they like...

  
Happy investing everyone.  I just wish I beeen doing this all along! ugh.. We really need to be telling people JUST starting out how to REALLY build wealth like this and with such simple easy steps it can be life changing I mean if I was doing this at age 20 I would have stayed on track with my diet, health and work balance and mindset so much better.. but hey, at least im starting now.

E.g. some people advise APPL with a 0.43% dividend yield for dividend appreciation (I think it has 14 years of increasing dividend). But as an investor interested in dividends, I wouldn't buy APPL now for dividend appreciation; nice adder but not the specific factor for me to buy it now. FDVV has NVDA as its top holding (with 0.02% yield) as well as sub 1% yields for 4 of its top 5 holdings - juicing or specifically good dividend picks? (and yes, I understand div reinvestment keeps accumulating more shares, more dividends). 

As one commenter said on one of my posts: ""I suggest spending some time to understand what dividend investing really means. Buying some dividend investments doesn't automatically make you a dividend investor.""

The same could be said for several other covered call ETFs that pay extraordinarily high div rates, such as MSTY.

1nayb7x,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 12:52:07,How do you track ex-div dates and dividend income forecasts?,"I’ve been investing in dividend stocks for a while, and one thing I’ve noticed is that my brokerages (Robinhood, Vanguard, Fidelity) don’t make it easy to see everything in one place.

Right now I’m piecing things together with spreadsheets to track:
	•	Ex-dividend dates
	•	Upcoming payout dates
	•	Dividend yield % changes
	•	My projected monthly/annual income

It works, but it’s clunky.

Curious:
	•	How do you track this?
	•	Do you just stick with your broker’s tools, use spreadsheets, or pay for something like SimplySafeDividends/Dividend.com?
	•	What’s the biggest pain point for you when it comes to tracking dividends?

1nasxhg,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 09:16:37,Dividend Portfolio 2025 – Should I stay with income focus or switch to growth?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve recently started building a dividend-focused portfolio and I’d love to get some feedback.

# My Goals

* Preserve and grow capital (I don’t want erosion)
* Generate consistent monthly income (like a “salary”)
* Reinvest all dividends until mid-2026
* Long-term wealth growth, but I’m not sure if my allocation is right

Current portfolio (about 21K ):

* SCHD – 162.99 shares (\~$4,505)
* JEPI – 74.63 shares (\~$4,237)
* JEPQ – 20.26 shares (\~$1,130)
* SPYI – 42.88 shares (\~$2,214)
* QQQI – 44.36 shares (\~$2,359)
* IYRI – 35.37 shares (\~$1,799)
* O – 28.21 shares (\~$1,666)
* STAG – 41.93 shares (\~$1,551)
* LTC – 43.50 shares (\~$1,593)

💵 Current dividends: about **$110-130/month**  
💵 Plan: I’m adding **$6K per month until May 2026** (around $54K more).

# My Dilemma

* Should I keep this income-heavy allocation?
* Or move towards more **growth exposure (maybe 60% covered call, 40% growth)?**
   * For growth I’m considering **Microsoft, Google, Meta**.
* My worry: am I **missing the train** if I stay too dividend-focused?
* Is it smarter to just go full growth now and switch to dividends later?

I’m still learning and don’t feel I have enough knowledge yet, so your thoughts would mean a lot 🙏

Thanks in advance!

1nasiyw,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 08:57:53,Low Volatility Distribution Sample,"I’ve seen alot of posts about chasing 15% distributions while avoiding too much instability. 

As a result, I’d like to share my sample portfolio. 

1. No Nasdaq related funds. It’s great for returns but the goal is minimal volatility. No bitcoin either. 

2. derivatives funds only being used. Obviously this alone makes it risky, but this is a narrow concept sample. I’d personally never have this portfolio as I love traditional ETFs too much 



A. DIVO - 25%

- this is the safest derivative ETF with the best all time charts. Consistent growth. Consistent distributions. It has gone through many many years of market movements. 

It has a fantastic selection criteria for its underlying stocks. And their precise and particular options writing focuses on best opportunities at the present and not a blanket approach. 

B. JEPI - 20%

- The largest AUM of all derivatives ETFs. JEPI has a strict selection of low volatility strong financials, usually holding around 100-120 underlying stocks. The downside is the growth on recoveries can be tough, but as shown during COVID, it weathers downturns amazingly. 

I love this once again due to the underlying selection process. Strong financials, blue chips. 

C. GPIX - 15%

- Holds the SP500 giving broader market exposure. Helps diversify your overall holdings. However this fund purposely tries to leave room for growth and not chase high distributions. This makes it excellent for long term holding into old age because of the growth it gives room for. 

I think this fund is fantastic. It delivers between 8-9% but still has every chart green. Sleeper etf. Should be bigger than it is. 

D. IDVO - 15%

- see DIVO above. Shorter history but similar fundamentals while holding international underlying strong stocks. Helps to further diversify. 

E. SPYI - 12.5%

- see GPIX, but focuses more on distribution total versus growth. This one is not going to give you much NAV at all. Its focus is on pay outs. As we are all hoping for income, this helps to amplify our total in the short term. It’s my dopamine hit. 

F. WTPI - 12.5%

- Cash Collateral and Puts on SPY (SP500). This one holds US treasury bills while doing short puts on SPY. 

This is actually one of my favorite investment products overall. Super low volatility with strong distribution percentages. It’s up 32% since 2017, so it has growth, even if minimal, NAV growth is so important for financial freedom. 


——

There you have it. This is my version of “safe” (it’s not that safe. Covered calls are inherently riskier than traditional dividend paying ETFs). 

I have purposely left JEPQ, GPIQ, and QQQI out (I hold these in my actual portfolio but they’re riskier and tied more volatility). 

Feel free to comment, leave criticism, ignore completely or roll your eyes. 

If there are any other safe derivative ETFs please feel free to share. 

Note that I thing green NAV is the most important part of these. So if you show me something that has great distributions but -25% in its lifetime, I will roll my eyes at you.

I decided to go for a dividend portfolio, with copmanies that has a worldwide presence, like mcd, nke, sbux, v, ect. and the reason is that i don't want my portfolio to be restricted only to one region or county. I have find these companies that have worldwide presence: mcd, nke, sbux, ko, pep, pg, cl, mkc, jnj, abt, abbv, mdt, novob, novn, azn, rog, msft, aapl, v, ma, orcl, blk, acn, cat, etn, emr, cvx, xom, adm, de, nesn, una, or, sie, sap, muv2, tte, hen, dge, bn(danone), txn. I want my portfolio to built around these companies but i don't mind buying dividend aristocrats from the us, i just want these to be in the focus. I study in a university and working in my family's restaurant, so i can invest 200-300€ per month, which is 50-75€ weekly. I might make more, but i also want to have a safe fund, which is around 4000-5000€, it's 6-8 months of living in my country. Im still living with my family, so i don't really need it now, but if i move in the next 3-4 years it might help me out. And also want to save for a car, and want to go out with my girlfried, so i don't want to invest all my earned money, but the half or 60% of it i do. So this is my plan. I made up my rules which is if a company have belove 3% of dividend, then it have to increse it atleast 6% a year, if it's above then it should increase atleast 4% a year. Their payout ratio should be under 70%. This is what i planed. At the moment i have this portfolio i uploaded. If anyone have any suggestion or idea what should i change on my plan, or how should i make it better, i would really appreciate your opinions or help.",11,7,0,dividends,reddit,https://i.redd.it/or4kpu4rnqnf1.jpeg,new,Opinion,0.88

The monthly dividend income from SPYI is obviously more than what the Pension Plan would pay out. I'm still quite some ways out of retirement, so I am able to see SPYI performance going forward for a couple of years before pulling the trigger.

I could do Roth conversions instead, but it means waiting for five years in order to receive monthly benefits... So, I think it's not an option.

And now that it’s September and we r getting into autumn and winter it’s time to hit the gym and bulk up with some good protein. I’m thinking of getting some HRL at the current $25 level. Here’s the elevator pitch……
1.) it’s a dividend king (50+ years of increasing dividends, it has paid an uninterrupted dividend since 1928)
2.) 4.5% dividend yield that is securely covered by earnings and FCF that should continue to grow annually
3.) SPAM has a large established global presence is growing in several key Asian countries. 
4.) Last quarters results I believe was a “kitchen sink” quarter given by the former and current interim CEO. They will put in modest price increases (that I think they can pass thru to consumers) to protect margins. Thus, I believe earnings will be better than the companies guide. 
5.) As mentioned earlier…. Cutting season is over because pool/beach season is over. It’s time to lift weight and get swole brah. So lift heavy and feed those working muscles with delicious applegate meats, hormel Mac and cheese, hormel meats, planters peanuts, Spam and others!
6.) So in conclusion…buy HRL at $25 and less. Collect rising dividends, use dividends to buy hormel proteins, lift weights, eat hormel proteins which makes muscles grow and repeat until desired bulk. BOOM that’s some DD!!!

Ohh and I don’t know if I have to say this legally but disclaimer: I am an investing enthusiast but I am not a financial nor investing professional. Do ur own DD.

VYM is heavy into financials, which bothers me at the moment, but schd is heavy into energy which really bothers me at the moment (downturn/recession, geopolitical eg opec+, Russia potentially flooding market, US production, EU and others with renewables).
