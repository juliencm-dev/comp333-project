1lw0ltf,2025-07-09,2025-07-09 21:46:40,Today I made $1m gains by selling my entire Nvidia portfolio,"Today marks perhaps my greatest investing milestone of all time!  The short story is I bought $36,000 worth of Nvidia over the course of 8 years. Last year I told myself once my account breaks $1m profit, I will sell the entire position, lock in the gains, and have a hell of a story to share for life.  Well today Nvidia hit a new all time high and I made that dream come true.

Below is a long version of how it all came to be: 

I first acquired Nvidia back in Feb 2017 and in a few lump sum purchases wound up with a total of 6,500 shares of NVDA.  My first purchase was for 1080 (in honor of my GTX 1080 I bought that year) and the share price at the time was a whopping $2.77!  My total investment around this time was $4000.  

Edit: I looked up the actual purchase numbers and the number of shares was actually 27 at $110 but since Nvidia had split multiple times, the number shown in my report today was reflecting those splits.  End of edit 

Back in 2017 all the talk was about Crypto mining and I naively thought Nvidia was the way Bitcoin would be mined forever so I bought into the mantra “during a gold rush, buy the company selling the shovels”.  This was around the time BTC hit $20,000 for the first time but it quickly collapsed and I was introduced into the volatility of the crypto world.  But I still held my Nvidia because I believed crypto was still at an early adoption stage.  

Over the next few years I continued to buy small amounts of Nvidia, in chunks of 100 shares here, 900 shares here, and eventually had 6,000 shares by 2019.  The average cost of all of these were around $2-$8 in today’s value.  

2019 is a significant milestone for me because I made a major life decision to move to Puerto Rico.  This move was made for several reasons but one consideration is the 0% tax on capital gains from stock sales.  I didn’t consider Nvidia being the one stock to move for but one reason for selling the whole lot was to lock in the 0% capital gains today 

I remember somewhere around 2019-2020 starting to think that GPUs and Nvidia specifically weren’t going to be tied to crypto as much as it would be the hardware needed to power self driving cars.  The hype around Tesla was growing and crypto mining started moving away from personal computers and I learned GPUs were falling out of favor for more powerful ASIC mining rigs.  So my mentality moved from Crypto to Electric Vehicles.  Keep in mind, I really didn’t know a lot about any of this and I view my Nvidia convictions at the time more as luck looking back.  

Then in 2020 the Pandemic hit and we saw major sales of GPUs for gaming, virtual reality, and supply chain disruption and of course massive inflation.  Stocks across the board were super volatile but in general things went bonkers in the tech sector.  Tesla was killing it and Nvidia might have doubled during this time.  It still had not gone parabolic yet but I still just kept holding onto my initial position.  My portfolio wasn’t really moving in any major way yet and in early 2019 I was actually slightly negative in my total Nvidia investment.  

Then in 2023 we saw the first mainstream use cases for Ai started popping up.  I’m in the photography and videography world so I noticed how disruptive image and video creation would be as soon as it hit.  All my colleagues were making images in Midjourney when the majority of my non photo friends had no clue what Ai image generation even was.  It ballooned quickly and that’s when my mind set changed a third time. Now Nvidia was going to be needed for data centers and personal computers to power this new Ai revolution.  It wasn’t about crypto or self driving cars anymore, it was about perhaps the biggest innovation humanity has seen since the internet was launched and the iPhone was revealed.  

Seemingly overnight my portfolio was sky rocking.  Where just a few years prior, Nvidia was in the red for me, it quickly started carving out a large portion of my portfolio.  Once a liability, Nvidia now made up 10%, 20%, and 30% of my entire investment account and retirement funds.  There were days when I would log in to see I had made $100,000 that day and a week later it would swing down -$105,000.  It was pretty crazy to see a full year’s worth of income bouncing around day by day in my account.  The temptation to sell had always been there since 2017 when I was up 20-100% but now I was up 4,000% and the temptation was even greater.  Every single one of my friends was telling me I had to take profits off the table.  I wound up holding.  

The last major purchase I made was in July 2021. I bought 400 shares for $14 which at the time was 3-5x what I had bought previously.  

Jump to June 2024 when Nvidia hit an all time high of $130.  My wife and I had just had our first child and my Nvidia position was hovering around $800,000 in total gains.  I knew I only had to make it to $160 per share to break the $1m mark and I told myself I would sell everything if that happened.  Of course the next month Nvidia corrected pretty hard and the reality of hitting $160 didn’t seem possible until July 3rd 2025, nearly a year after I made my original decision to sell.  

I should have sold everything on July 3rd but I didn’t realize the trading day was shortened for the 4th of July holiday coming up. I also didn’t setup any automated sell triggers since I wanted to ceremoniously do the trade myself.  It worked out in my favor as I was able to sell today at $163 and make a little more than the $1m cutoff I originally set to sell at. 

Here are the raw numbers:

Total invested: $36,352
Total sale: $1,059,591
Total gains: $1,023,238
Average cost per share: $5.60
Time to materialize: 8 years and a lot of emotional rollercoasters!


I know a lot of people get caught up in fancy investment options that feels more like gambling but hopefully this success story inspires those of you who are like me and just what to buy shares, hold them, and eventually offload them when the time seems right.

""What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode, is to not do anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new view, to create a fiction.""

""Then you call the (Wall Street) Journal and get the bozo reporter in Research in Motion and you would feed that (rival) Palm's got a killer it's going to give away. These are all the things you must do on a day like today, and if you're not doing it, maybe you shouldn't be in the game.""

“It might cost me $15 million or $20 million to knock RIM down but it would be fabulous because it would beleaguer all the moron longs who are also keying on Research in Motion.""

""A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... meaning I needed (a stock) down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game.""

""Who cares about the fundamentals? The great thing about the market is that it has nothing to do with the actual stocks.""

la3bft,2021-02-01,2021-02-01 08:42:51,"Emotional involvement has never been this high, please understand the risk involved.","First of all, I can't wait to be berated in the comments. 

I'm gonna be blunt, I have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week.  A lot more than normal.  And compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here.  So let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose.  Short, long, whatever.  It doesn't matter if you're a 19 year old throwing in your life savings or Bill fucking Ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with Herbalife.  Letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money. 

And a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this GME, AMC, whatever.

To the point: I am not making a buy/sell/hold/whatever recommendation.  I have no special insight in to what's happening with GME or whatever else.  What I can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $300.

So let's dispel one quick thing: this is not David vs Goliath.  It also isn't the little man vs hedge funds or WSB vs big finance.  It might have started out that way, but if you only read one thing [read this](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop): 

>Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in U.S. stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect—I certainly expected—to see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.

>But here’s what Citadel Securities’ retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1

>[Graphic here](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9SnRzR8AM1c/v0/800x-1.png)


>Retail investors were net buyers on Monday but net sellers for the rest of the week (through yesterday), and all in all quite balanced: About 49.8% of retail orders (that Citadel Securities saw) were to buy, and 50.2% were to sell.

>What do you make of that? One reading would be: “Retail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they’re not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.” Or as one Twitter user put it, “past the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.”



So, just to be clear about this, there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade, and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker.  

**Understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover**.  
You, and everyone else, have no idea what Melvin's position looks like, and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened.  You don't know how hedged they are, you don't know what their collateral looks like, and you don't know if they've covered and restructured a short at last week's prices.  You simply don't know.  You only know what's been presented in the news, which is almost certainly bullshit.  

This thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you won't know what happened for weeks.  You might go take a shit at 1pm today and come back to GME trading at $16 because Ken Griffin got on CNBC and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $200, and were happy to sit on it.  Make no mistake, you'll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend.    

**Emotions**
The problem with this whole ""strike back at wall street"" narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade.  Losing money sucks, but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt.  This isn't a moral crusade to them, it's 25 billion dollars.  So if you're out here putting money and emotions on the line that you can't afford to lose there won't be a happy ending. 

Want to fight the good fight against wall street? Write your congressman, Tweet AOC or Ted Cruz, get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet.  But dropping money on GME that you need in life ain't gonna change anything except your net worth.

TLDR: 

1) know and understand who is playing this game.  And that they have access to tools, leverage, and markets that you do not.  You're playing Le Chiffre at Casino Royale right now, you might think you're James Bond but there's a good chance that you're just the fat dude in the corner. 

2) Short squeezes end fast.  As fast as they started.  If you're new to trading then understand buying GME at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a TikTock about it.

3) Get your emotions out of play here.  This whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes.  Can't handle that?  then maybe it's not a good idea to sit at this table.  

Lastly, if you really just can't get yourself out of the whole ""fight the hedge funds"" nonsense, at least understand that you're spending money that you likely won't get back.  If that's worth it to you then have at it.  But don't fool yourself  in to thinking otherwise.

Today was a study in the power of fear, courage, and the levers you can pull when you wield billions of dollars...

Woops, excuse me. I'm sorry hedge fund guys... I meant trillions of dollars--I just briefly forget you control not just your own but a lot of other peoples' money too for a moment there.

Also, for people still trading this on market-based rationale (as I am), it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis.  I like to think I have conviction, but in case you are somehow not yet familiar with the legend of DFV, you need to see these posts (fair warning, nsfw, and some may be offended/triggered by the crude language).

# Pre-Market

Disclaimer: given yesterday's pre-market action I didn't even pay attention to the screen until near retail pre-market.  I'm less confident in my ability to read what's going on in a historical chart vs the feel I get watching live, but I'll try.

Early in the pre-market it looks to me like some momentum traders are taking profit, discounting the probability that the short-side will give them a deep discount later, which you can reasonably assume given the strategy they ran yesterday.  If they're right they can sell some small volume into the pre-market top, wait for the hedge funds try to run the price back down, and then lever up the gains even higher buying the dip.  Buy-side here look to me like people FOMOing and YOLOing in at any price to grab their slice of gainz, or what looks to be market history in the making.  No way are short-side hedge funds trying to cover anything at these prices.

[Mark Cuban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZZnVs-KM4)\--well said!  Free markets baby!

Mohamed El-Erian is money in the bank as always.  ""upgrade in quality"" on the pandemic drop was the best, clearest actionable call while most were at peak panic, and boy did it print.  Your identifying the bubble as the excessive short (vs blaming retail activity) is [money yet again](https://youtu.be/Gxan42tXhbo?t=164).  Also, The PAIN TRADE (sorry, later interview segment I only have on DVR, couldn't find on youtube--maybe someone else can)!

The short attack starts, but I'm hoping no one was panicking this time--we've seen it before.  Looks like the momentum guys are minting money buying the double dip into market open.

CNBC, please get a good market technician to explain the market action.  Buy-side dominance, sell-side share availability evaporating into nothing (look at day-by-day volume last few days), this thing is now at runaway supercritical mass.  There is no changing the trajectory unless you can change the very fabric of the market and the rules behind it (woops, I guess I should have knocked on wood there).

If you know the mechanics, what's happening in the market with GME is not mysterious AT ALL.  I feel like you guys are trying to scare retail out early ""for their own good"" (with all sincerity, to your credit) rather than explain what's happening.  Possibly you also fear that explaining it would equate to enabling/encouraging people to keep trying to do it inappropriately (possibly fair point, but at least come out and say that if that's the case).  Outside the market, however...wow.

# You Thought Yesterday Was Fear?  THIS is Fear!

Ok short-side people, my hat is off to you.  Just when I thought shouting fire in a locked theater was fear mongering poetry in motion, you went and took it to 11.  What's even better?  Yelling fire in a theater with only one exit.  That way people can cause the financial equivalent of stampede casualties.  Absolutely brilliant.

Robin Hood disables buying of GME, AMC, and a few of the other WSB favorites.  Other brokerages do the same.  Even for people on 0% margin.  Man, and here I thought I had seen it all yesterday.

*Side note:  I will give a shout out to TD Ameritrade.  You guys got erroneously lumped together with RH during an early CNBC segment, but you telegraphed the volatility risk management changes and gradually ramped up margin requirements over the past week.  No one on your platform should have been surprised if they were paying attention.  And you didn't stop anyone from trading their own money at any point in time. My account balance thanks you.  I heard others may have had problems, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt given the DDOS attacks that were flyiing around*

Robin Hood.  Seriously WTF.  I'm sure it was TOTALLY coincidence that your big announcements happen almost precisely when what has to be one of the best and most aggressive short ladder attacks of all time starts painting the tape, what looked like a DDOS attack on Reddit's CDN infrastructure (pretty certain it was the CDN because other stuff got taken out at the same time too), and a flood of bots hit social media (ok, short-side, this last one is getting old).

Taking out a large-scale cloud CDN is real big boy stuff though, so I wouldn't entirely rule out nation state type action--those guys are good at sniffing out opportunities to foment social unrest.

Anyway, at this point, as the market dives, I have to admit I was worried for a moment.  Not that somehow the short-side would win (hah! the long-side whales in the pond know what's up), but that a lot of retail would get hurt in the action.  That concern subsided quite a bit on the third halt on that slide.  But first...

**A side lesson on market orders**

Someone printed bonus bank big time (and someone lost--I feel your pain, whoever you are).

During the face-ripping volatility my play money account briefly ascended to rarified heights of 7 figures.  It took me a second to realize it, then another second to process it.  Then, as soon as it clicked, that one, glorious moment in time was gone.

What happened?

During the insane chop of the short ladder attack, someone decided to sweep the 29 Jan 21 115 Call contracts, but they couldn't get a grip on the price, which was going coast to coast as IV blew up and the price was being slammed around.  So whoever was trying to buy said ""F it, MARKET ORDER"" (i.e. buy up to $X,XXX,XXX worth of contracts at any price).  This is referred to as a sweep if funded to buy all/most of the contracts on offer (HFT shops snipe every contract at each specific price with a shotgun of limit orders, which is far safer, but something only near-market compute resources can do really well).  For retail, or old-tech pros, if you want all the contracts quickly, you drop a market order loaded with big bucks and see what you get... BUT, some clever shark had contracts available for the reasonable sum of... $4,400, or something around that. I was too stunned to grab a screencap. The buy market order swept the book clean and ran right into that glorious, nigh-obscene backstop limit.  So someone got nearly $440,000 PER CONTRACT that was, at the time theoretically priced at around $15,000.  $425,000 loss... PER CONTRACT.  Maybe I'm not giving the buyer enough credit.. you can get sniped like that even if you try to do a safety check of the order book first, but, especially in low liquidity environments, if a HFT can peak into your order flow (or maybe just observes a high volume of sweeps occurring), they can end up front running your sweep, pick off the reasonable contracts, and slam a ridiculous limit sell order into place before your order makes it to the exchange.  Either way, I hope that sweep wasn't loaded for bear into the millions.  If so... OUCH.  Someone got cleaned out.

So, the lesson here folks... in a super high volatility, low-liquidity market, a market order will just run up the ladder into the first sell order it can find, and some very brutal people will put limit sells like that out there just in case they hit the jackpot.  And someone did.  If you're on the winning side, great.  It can basically bankrupt you if you're on the losing side.  My recommendation: Just don't try it.  I wouldn't be surprised if really shady shenanigans were involved in this, but no way to know (normally that's crazy-type talk, but after today....peeking at order flow and sniping sweeps is one of the fastest, most financially devastating ways to bleed big long-side players, just sayin').

**edit** *so while I was too busy trying not to spit out my coffee to grab a screenshot, /u/piddlesthethug was faster on the draw and captured this: https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu

Ok, so I guess my in-the-moment mental math was off by about 10%. Man, that hurts just thinking about the guy who lost on that trade.*

Back to the market action..

# A Ray of Light Through the Darkness

So I was worried watching the crazy downward movement for two different reasons.

On the one hand, I was worried the momentum pros would get the best discounts on the dip (I'll admit, I FOMO'd in too early, unnecessarily raising my cost basis).

On the other hand, I was worried for the retail people on Robin Hood who might be bailing out into incredibly steep losses because they had only two options: Watch the slide, or bail.  All while dealing with what looked to me like a broad-based cloud CDN outage as they tried to get info from WSB HQ, and wondering if the insta-flood of bot messages were actually real people this time, and that everyone else was bailing on them to leave them holding the bag.

But I saw the retail flag flying high on the 3rd market halt (IIRC), and I knew most would be ok.  What did I see, you ask?  Why, the glorious  $211.00 / **$5,000** bid/ask spread.  WSB Reddit is down?  Those crazy mofos give you the finger right on the ticker tape.  I've been asked many times in the last few hours about why I was so sure shorts weren't covering on the down move.  THIS is how I knew.  For sure.  It's in the market data itself.

**edit** *So, there's feedback in the comments that this is likely more of a technical glitch.  Man, at least it was hilarious in the moment.  But also now I know maybe not to trust price updates when the spread between orders being posted is so wide.  Maybe a technical limitation of TOS*

I'll admit, I tried to one-up those bros with a 4206.90 limit sell order, but it never made it through.  I'm impressed that the HFT guys at the hedge fund must have realized really quickly what a morale booster that kind of thing would have been, and kept a lower backstop ask in place almost continuously from then on  I'm sure others tried the same thing.  Occasionally $1,000 and other high-dollar asks would peak through from time to time from then on, which told me the long-side HFTs were probably successfully sniping the backstops regularly.

So, translating for those of you who found that confusing.  First, such a high ask is basically a FU to the short-side (who, as you remember, need to eventually buy shares to cover their short positions).  More importantly, as an indicator of retail sentiment, it meant that NO ONE ELSE WAS TRYING TO SELL AT ANY PRICE LOWER THAN $5,000.  Absolutely no one was bailing out.

I laughed for a minute, then started getting a little worried.  Holy cow.. NO retail selling into the fear?  How are they resisting that kind of price move??

The answer, as we all know now... they weren't afraid... they weren't even worried.  They were F\*CKING PISSED.

Meanwhile the momentum guys and long-side HFTs keep gobbling up the generously donated shares that the short-side are plowing into their ladder attack.  Lots of HFT duels going on as long-side HFTs try to intercept shares meant to travel between short-side HFT accounts for their ladder.  You can tell when you see prices like $227.0001 constantly flying across the tape.  Retail can't even attempt to enter an order like that--those are for the big boys with privileged low-latency access.

The fact that you can even see that on the tape with human eyes is really bad for the short-side people.

Why, you ask?  Because it means liquidity is drying up, and fast.

# The Liquidity Tide is Flowing Out Quickly.  Who's Naked (short)?

Market technicals time.   I still wish this sub would allow pictures so I could throw up a chart, but I guess a table will do fine.

&#x200B;

|Date|Volume|Price at US Market Close|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Friday, 1/22/21|197,157,196|$65.01|
|Monday, 1/25/21|177,874,00|$76.79|
|Tuesday, 1/26/21|178,587,974|$147.98|
|Wednesday, 1/27/21|93,396,666|$347.51|
|Thursday, 1/28/21|58,815,805|$193.60|

What do I see?  I see the shares available to trade dropping so fast that all the near-exchange compute power in the world won't let the short-side HFTs maintain order flow volume for their attacks.  Many retail people asking me questions thought today was the heaviest trading.  Nope--it was just the craziest.

What about the price dropping on Thursday?  Is that a sign that the short-side pulled a miracle out and pushed price down against a parabolic move on even less volume than Wednesday? Is the long side running out of capital?

Nope.  It means the short-side hedge funds are just about finished.

But wait, I thought the price needed to be higher for them to be taken out?  How is it that price being lower is bad for them?  Won't that allow them to cover at a lower price?

No, the volume is so low that they can't cover any meaningful fraction of their position without spiking the price parabolic almost instantly.  Just not enough shares on offer at reasonable prices (especially when WSB keeps flashing you 6942.00s).

It's true, a higher price hurts, but the interest charge for one more day is just noise at this point.  The only tick that will REALLY count is the last tick of trading on Friday.

In the meantime, the price drop (and watching the sparring in real time) tells me that the long-side whales and their HFT quants are so certain of the squeeze that they're no longer worried AT ALL about whether it will happen, and they aren't even worried at all about retail morale to help carry the water anymore.

Instead, they're now really, really worried about how CHEAPLY they can make it happen.

They are wondering if they can't edge out just a sliver more alpha out of what will already be a blow-out trade for the history books (probably).  You see, to make it happen they just have to keep hoovering up shares.  It doesn't matter what those shares cost.  If you're certain that the squeeze is now locked in, why push the price up and pay more than you have to?  Just keep pressing hard enough to force short-side to keep sending those tasty shares your way, but not so much you move the price.  Short-side realizes this and doesn't try to drive price down too aggressively.  They can't afford to let price run away, so they have to keep some pressure on at the lowest volume they can manage, but they don't want to push down too hard and give the long-side HFTs too deep of a discount and bleed their ammo out even faster.  That dynamic keeps price within a narrow (for GME today, anyway) trading range for the rest of the day into the close.

Good plan guys, but those after market people are pushing the price up again.  Damnit WSB bros and Euros, you're costing those poor long-side whales their extra 0.0000001% of alpha on this trade just so you can run up your green rockets... See, that's the kind of nonsense that just validates [Lee Cooperman's](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs?t=279) concerns.

On a totally unrelated note, I have to say that I appreciate the shift in CNBC's reporting.  Much more thoughtful and informed.  Just please get a good market technician in there who will be willing to talk about what is going on under the hood if possible.  A lot of people watching on the sidelines are far more terrified than they need to be because it all looks random to them.  And they're worried that you guys look confused and worried--and if the experts on the news are worried....??!

You should be able to find one who has access to the really good data that we retailers can only guess at, who can explain it to us unwashed masses.

# Ok, So.. Questions

**There is no market justification for this.  How can you tell me is this fundamentally sound and not just straight throwing money away irresponsibly??** *(side note: not that that should matter--if you want to throw your money away why shouldn't you be allowed to?)*

We're not trading in your securities pricing model.  This isn't irrational just because your model says long and short positions are the same thing.  The model is not a real market.  There is asymmetrical counterparty risk here given the shorts are on the hook for all the money they have, and possibly all the money their brokers have, and possibly anyone with exposure to the broker too!  You may want people to trade by the rules you want them to follow.  But the rest of us trade in the real market as it is actually implemented.  Remember?  That's what you tell the retailers who take their accounts to zero.  Remember what you told the KBIO short-squeezed people?  They had fair warning that short positions carry infinite risk, including more than your initial investment.  You guys know this.  It's literally part of your job to know this.

But-but-the systemic risk!! This is Madness!

...Madness?

THIS. IS. **THE MARKET!!! \*Retail kicks the short-side hedge funds down an infinity loss black hole\***.

Ok, seriously though, that is actually a fundamentally sound, and properly profit-driven answer at least as justifiable as the hedge funds' justification for going >100% of float short.  If they can be allowed to gamble INFINITE LOSSES because they expect to make profit on the possibility the company goes bankrupt, can't others do the inverse on the possibility the company I don't know.. doesn't go bankrupt and gets a better strategy from the team that created what is now a $43bn market cap company (CHWY) that does exactly some of the things GME needs to do (digital revenue growth) maybe?  I mean, I first bought in on that fundamental value thesis in the 30s and then upped my cost basis given the asymmetry of risk in the technical analysis as an obvious no-brainer momentum trade.  The squeeze is just, as WSB people might say, tendies raining down from on high as an added bonus.

I get that you disagree on the fundamental viability of GME.  Great.  Isn't that what makes a market?

Regarding the consequences of a squeeze, in practice my expectation was maybe at worst some kind of ex-market settlement after liquidation of the funds with exposure to keep things nice and orderly for the rest of the market.  I mean, they handled the VW thing somehow right?  I see now that I just underestimated elite hedge fund managers though--those guys are so hardcore (I'll explain why I think so a bit lower down).

**If hedge fund people are so hardcore, how did the retail long side ever have a chance of winning this squeeze trade they're talking about?**

Because it's an asymmetrical battle once you have short interest cornered.  And the risk is also crazily asymmetrical in favor of the long side if short interest is what it is in GME.  In fact, the hedge funds essentially cornered themselves without anyone even doing anything.  They just dug themselves right in there.  Kind of impressive really, in a weird way.

What does the short side need to cover?  They need the price to be low, and they need to buy shares.

How does price move lower?  You have to push share volume such that supply overwhelms demand and price therefore goes down (man, I knew econ 101 would come in handy someday).

But wait... if you have to sell shares to push the price down.. won't you just undo all your work when you have to buy it back to actually cover?

The trick is you have to push price down so hard, so fast, so unpredictably, that you SCARE OTHER PEOPLE into selling their shares too, because they're scared of taking losses.  Their sales help push the price down for free! and then you scoop them up at discount price!  Also, there are ways to make people scared other than price movement and fear of losses, when you get right down to it.  So, you know, you just need to get really, really, really good at making people scared.  Remember to add a line item to your budget to make sure you can really do it right.

On the other hand..

What does the long side need to do?  They need to own as much of the shares as they can get their hands on.  And then they need to hold on to them.  They can't be weak hands either.  They need to be hands that will hold even under the most intense heat of battle, and the immense pressure of mind-numbing fear... they need to be as if they were made of... diamond... (oh wow, maybe those WSB people kind of have a point here).

Why does this matter?  Because at some point the sell side will eventually run out of shares to borrow.  They simply won't be there, because they'll be safely tucked away in the long-side's accounts.  Once you run out of shares to borrow and sell, you have no way to move the price anymore.  You can't just drop a fat stack--excuse me, I mean suitcase (we're talking hedge fund money here after all)--of Benjamins on the ticker tape directly.  Only shares.  No more shares, no way to have any direct effect on the price whatsoever.

Ok, doesn't that just mean trading stops?  Can't you just out-wait the long side then?

Well, you could.. until someone on the long side puts 1 share up on a 69420 ask, and an even crazier person actually buys at that price on the last tick on a Friday.  Let's just say it gets really bad at that point.

Ok.. but how do the retail people actually get paid?

Well, to be quite honest, it's entirely up to each of them individually.  You've seen the volumes being thrown around the past week+.  I guarantee you every single retailer out there could have printed money multiple times trading that flow. If they choose to, and time it well.  Or they could lose it all--this is the market. Some of them apparently seem to have some plan, or an implicit trust in certain individuals to help them know when to punch out.  Maybe it works out, but maybe not.  There will be financial casualties on the field for sure--this is the bare-knuckled capitalist jungle after all, remember?  But everyone ponied up to the table with their own money somehow, so they all get to play in the big leagues just like everyone else.  In theory, anyway.

And now, Probably the #1 question I've been asked on all of these posts has been: **So what happens next?**  Do we get the infinity squeeze?  Do the hedge funds go down?

Great questions.  I don't know.  No one does.  That's what I've said every time, but I get that's a frustrating answer, so I'll write a bit more and speculate further.  Please again understand these are my opinions with a degree of speculation I wouldn't normally put in a post.

# The Market and the Economy.  Main Street, Wall Street, and Washington

The pandemic has hurt so many people that it's hard to comprehend.  Honestly, I don't even pretend to be able to.  I have been crazy fortunate enough to almost not be affected at all. Honestly, it is a little unnerving to me how great the disconnect is between people who are doing fine (or better than fine, looking at my IRA) versus the people who are on the opposite side of the ever-widening divide that, let's be honest, has been growing wider since long before the pandemic.

People on the other side--who have been told they cannot work even if they want to, who wonder if congress will get it together to at least keep them from getting thrown out of their house if they have to keep taking one for the team for the good of all, are wondering if they're even living in the same reality.

Because all they see on the news each day is that the stock market is at record highs, or some amazing tech stocks have 10x'd in the last 6 months.  How can that be happening during a pandemic?  Because The Market is not The Economy.  The Market looks forward to that brighter future that Economy types just need to wait for.  Don't worry--it'll be here sometime before the end of the year.  We think.  We're making money on that assumption right now, anyway.  Oh, by the way, if you're in The Market, you get to get richer as a minor, unearned side-effect of the solutions our governments have come up with to fight the pandemic.

Wow.  That sounds amazing. How do I get to part of that world?

Retail fintech, baby. Physical assets like real estate might be a bit out of reach at the moment, but stocks will do.  I can even buy fractional shares of BRK/A LOL.  

Finally, I can trade for my own slice of heaven, watching that balance go up (and up--go stonks!!).  Now I too get to dream the dream.  I get to feel connected to that mythical world, The Market, rather than being stuck in the plain old Economy.  Sure, I might blow up my account, but that's because it's the jungle.  Bare-knuckled, big league capitalism going on right here, and at least I get to show up an put my shares on the table with everyone else.  At least I'm playing the same game.  Everyone has to start somewhere--at least now I get to start, even if I have to learn my lesson by zeroing my account a few times.  I've basically had to deal with what felt like my life zeroing out a few times before.  This is number on a screen going to 0 is nothing.

Laugh or cry, right?  I'll post my losses on WSB and at least get some laughs.

Geez, some of the people here are making bank.  I better learn from them and see if they'll let me in on their trades.  Wow... this actually might work.  I don't understand yet, but I trust these guys telling me to hold onto this crazy trade.  I don't understand it, but all the memes say it's going to be big.

...WOW... I can pay off my credit card with this number.  Do I punch out now?  No?  Hold?... Ok, getting nervous watching the number go down but I trust you freaks.  We're still in the jungle, but at least I'm in with with my posse now.  Market open tomorrow--we ride the rocket baby!  And if it goes down, at least I'm going down with my crew.  At least if that happens the memes will be so hilarious I'll forget to cry.

Wow.. I can't believe it... we might actually pull this off.  Laugh at us now, ""pros""!

We're in The Market now, and Market rules tell us what is going to happen.  We're getting all that hedge fund money Right? Right?

Maybe.

First, I say maybe because nothing is ever guaranteed until it clears.  Secondly, because the rules of The Market are not as perfectly enforced as we would like to assume.  We are also finding out they may not be perfectly fair.  The Market most experts are willing to talk about is really more like the ideal The Market is supposed to be.  This is the version of the market I make my trading decisions in.  However, the Real Market gets strange and unpredictable at the edges, when things are taken to extremes, or rules are pushed beyond the breaking point, or some of the mechanics deep in the guts of the Real Market get stretched.  GME ticks basically all of those boxes, which is why so many people are getting nervous (aside from the crazy money they might lose).  It's also important to remember that the sheer amount of money flowing through the market has distorting power unto itself.  Because it's money, and people really, really, really like their money--especially when they're used to having a lot of it, and rules involving that kind of money tend to look more... flexible, shall we say.

Ok, back to GME.  If this situation with GME is allowed to play out to its conclusion in The Market, we'll see what happens.  I think all the long-side people get the chance to be paid (what, I'm not sure--and remember, you have to actually sell your position at some point or it's all still just numbers on your screen), but no one knows for certain.

But this might legitimately get so big that it spills out of The Market and back into The Economy.

Geez, and here I thought the point of all of this was so that we all get to make so much money we wouldn't ever have to think and worry about that thing again.

Unfortunately, while he's kind of a buzzkill, [Thomas Petterfy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) has a point.  This could be a serious problem.

It might blow out The Market, which will definitely crap on The Economy, which as we all know from hard experience, will seriously crush Main Street.

If it's that big a deal, we may even need Washington to be involved.  Once that happens, who knows what to expect.. this kind of scenario being possible is why I've been saying I have no idea how this ends, and no one else does either.

How did we end up in this ridiculous situation?  From GAMESTOP??  And it's not Retail's fault the situation is what it is.. why is everyone telling US that we need to back down to save The Market?? What about the short-side hedge funds that slammed that risk into the system to begin with??  We're just playing by the rules of The Market!!

Well, here are my thoughts, opinions, and some even further speculation...  This may be total fantasy land stuff here, but since I keep getting asked I'll share anyway.  Just keep that disclaimer in mind.

# A Study in Big Finance Power Moves: If you owe the bank $10,000, it's your problem...

What happens when you owe money you have no way to pay back?  It's a scary question to have to face personally.  Still, on balance and on average, if you're fortunate enough to have access to credit the borrowing is a risk that is worth taking (especially if you're reasonably careful).  Lenders can take a risk loaning you money, you take a risk by borrowing in order to do something now that you would otherwise have had to wait a long time or maybe would never have realistically been able to do otherwise.  Sometimes it doesn't work out.  Sometimes it's due to reasons totally beyond your control.  In any case, if you find yourself there you have no choice but to dust yourself off, pick yourself up as best as you can, and try to move on and rebuild. A lot of people had to learn that in 2008.  Man that year really sucked.

Wall street learned their lessons too.  Most learned what I think most of us would consider the right lessons--lessons about risk management, and the need to guard vigilantly against systemic risk, concentration of risk through excess concentration of leverage on common assets, etc.  Many suspect that at least a few others may have learned an entirely different set of, shall we say, unhealthy lessons.  Also, to try to be completely fair, maybe managing other peoples' money on 10x+ leverage comes with a kind of pressure that just clouds your judgement.  I could actually, genuinely buy that.  I know I make mistakes under pressure even when I'm trading risk capital I could totally lose with no real consequence. Whatever the motive, here's my read on what's happening:

First, remember that as much fun as WSB are making of the short-side hedge fund guys right now, those guys are smart.  Scary smart.  Keep that in mind.

Next, let's put ourselves in their shoes.

If you're a high-alpha hedge fund manager slinging trades on a $20bn 10x leveraged to 200bn portfolio, get caught in a bad situation, and are down mark-to-market several hundred million.. what do you do?  Do you take your losses and try again next time?  Hell no.

You're elite.  You don't realize losses--you double down--you can still save this trade no sweat.

But what if that doesn't work out so well and you're in the hole >$2bn?  Obvious double down.  Need you ask? I'm net up on the rest of my positions (of course), and the momentum when this thing makes its mean reversion move will be so hot you can almost taste the alpha from here.  Speaking of momentum, imagine the move if your friends on TV start hyping the story harder! Genius!

Ok, so that still didn't work... this is now a frigging 7 sigma departure from your modeled risk, and you're now locked into a situation that is about as close to mathematically impossible to escape as you can get in the real world, and quickly converging on infinite downside. Holy crap. The fund might be liquidated by your prime broker by tomorrow morning--and man, even the broker is freaking out.  F'in Elon Musk and his twitter!  You're cancelling your advance booking on his rocket ship to Mars first thing tomorrow...  Ok, focus--this might legit impact your total annual return.  You need a plan, and you know the smartest people on the planet, right?  The masters of the universe!  Awesome--they've even seen this kind of thing before and still have the playbook!! Of course! It's obvious now--you borrow a few more billion and double down again first thing in the morning. So simple.  Sticky note that Mars trip cancellation so you don't forget.

Ok... so that didn't work?  You even cashed in some pretty heavy chits too.  Ah well, that was a long shot anyway.  So where were you?  Oh yeah.. if shenanigans don't work, skip to page 10...

...Which says, of course, to double down again.  Anyone even keeping track anymore?  Oh, S3 says it's $40bn and we're going parabolic?  Man, that chart gives me goosebumps.  All according to plan...

***So what happens tomorrow? One possible outcome of PURE FANTASTIC SPECULATION...***

End of the week--phew.  Never though it'd come.  Where are you at now?... Over $9000^(\*)!!!  Wow.  You did it boys, and as a bonus the memes will be so sweet.

^(\*)*side note: add 8 zeros to the end...*

Awesome--your problems have been solved. Because...

The first reason I thought it worth sharing is because the teacher (Andrew Lo) is probably the best and most passionate finance professor I've ever seen. Really hooks you into the lectures. 

The second is that the course is filmed during the height of the subprime crisis, and each lecture starts with a discussion of recent events and how they relate to concepts in the course. Very interesting to hear perspectives and how they progress throughout the crisis.

If you make a post and think it's a quality contribution to the subreddit send a message to modmail and we can approve it.**

The last two days have seen something like 200 post removals to start with, so with WSB going private and it being 7pm already, which is when we're typically light on mods, I'm just going to step in and stop this nonsense for the time being.

Also, Reddit has been having server issues all day meaning automod is just fucking up all over the place and not doing it's job.  This also means modmail is on the fritz, so if you don't get a response in a timely manner I apologize but there's not a lot we can do about it - I couldn't even message other mods to warn em I was doing this.  Reddit is a shitshow rn and we can't spend our whole night fixing it unfortunately.  If people weren't spamming the sub with garbage all day we wouldn't be here. 

Lastly, as a PSA to all of the people who think they've been on WSB for a while and are confused: you haven't been on WSB for a while if this is confusing.  They regularly go private.  It's not the SEC, it's not the FBI, it's not whomever else they say is investigating them.  It's because the mods are tired of dealing with noobs that flood the sub after a media event so they just shut it down.  Hopefully that don't hit ya like a brick in the ol cranium...   

This is why we can't have nice things.

Apologies to all the real ones.

E: Just FYI, if you're messaging modmail about getting a post approved, and your post is about GME, Short squeezes, your thoughts on shorts, or whatever else, then there's a 99.99% chance it's not getting approved unless you have a very in depth analysis or some new and important news item.  Add your thoughts to one of the existing threads.

e2: looks like they're back, I'm still going to keep the post block here for a bit, prior to WSB going down we had probably 40 threads that should have been comments in existing threads.  To be completely honest we have been in need of some sort of overhaul in both moderation and rules for some time - the onslaught of frankly very low effort posts over the last few days has only served to expose just how much we rely on users to do the right thing with regard to posting, this isn't the thread for that, and I'm slammed at work, but it's gotta happen at some point.

e3: y'all, 5 people DMd me and 6 others messaged our modmail asking for access to WSB.  That is NOT how reddit works lol.  I do think this is illustrative of how many people have flocked to this sub and this site without understanding any of it recently.

e4: in the last 60 minutes there were 53 new submissions, of those only 4 were actual posts worth making.

Apparently, that wasn't low enough as it's now been revised down to 2.8% decline.

6 weeks to swing from 2.9% growth to 2.8% contraction.  That's a crazy level of slow down in the economy under this Administration in such little time.

It's such a bad economic forecast that the Commerce Department is wanting to hide the number by changing the way GDP is calculated. That's like North Korea or Russia just making up economic numbers. What in the world is happening here??

The US is losing its stability and integrity.  Capital will be allocated away from the USA if they go through with this.

l97jbo,2021-01-31,2021-01-31 02:39:53,Gamestop Big Picture: Market Mechanics,"*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.* 

Rather than doing a writeup of Friday, I think the time I have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics.  As I mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week, my first glance was that Friday was a low conviction, low volume day where momentum traders/and volatility arbitraging HFT algos were skirmishing, and a slightly deeper look tells me that's probably the case for almost the entire day, up to the last minutes before close.

There was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain.  Keep in mind also that on Friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with GME, and GME price was also protected from aggressive short-side attack due to the uptick rule.

# Capital Flow, Liquid Float, and Price

Ok, so let's go with a diagram I put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze.  This is not very formal--just conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price, liquid free float, and capital required to move things around.

[Capital Flow to Price Volatility Leverage Conceptual Diagram](https://u.teknik.io/DDa8Y.PNG)

As you can see in the diagram, I figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw.

On the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float, moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right, except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold, which moves the fulcrum to the left.

The lower the liquid free float, or the further to the left the fulcrum goes, the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow (net selling or buying) on share price.  Importantly, as the diagrams on the right half show, it's not a linear relationship.  The closer the liquid free float comes to 0%, the faster the price volatility increases... theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches 0%.

I find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify.  On the extremely liquid side, if you have all of the tens of millions of GME shares in play, dropping $10,000 in to buy shares probably doesn't even register on the ticker.  On the other extreme, if what if there was only 1 share in play?  That same $10,000 instantly prices GME at $10,000 a share--if you can even get the person holding it to sell!

Since company value is estimated mark-to-market, GME would instantly become rated one of the most  (if not the most) valuable companies in the world.  This is in no way true, of course, as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price, but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned, they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to re-price the company.

So, in the grand scheme of things, in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze, the primary factor is locking up actively traded/liquid free float.  Also important to keep in mind, locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down, and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility, reaching its limit where going from 2 actively traded shares to 1 actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share.

So simple, right?  Actually, yes. However, don't mistake simple for easy (absolutely not the same thing in this case).

# Market Games

So, GME and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants.  On the one hand, you have normal investors and traders who don't really pay attention to it at all, and, if they do, they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility (people tend to short stocks as price goes up, and cover shorts as price drops, so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable).

Then you have what I'll call market gamers.  These are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish, and just pay attention to what they actually do.  There are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance, and shorting is one of them, as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a company's share price and actually harm the company badly.  The counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze, which gets worse with extreme price volatility.

Imagine it this way.  Short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange feature--a closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that, if slammed with a high enough day or week end price, blows open and sucks their account capital through, and possibly their broker's capital too, until they've patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short.

That's not how you're supposed to look at it, but that's kind of how it actually works in practice.  Most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way, but with Millenials and younger jumping in to the market we're talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing [4 minute speed runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSYY4k52GEs) through games intended to take[\~100 hrs](https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=21614) to complete, using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers.  That's kind of what GME is like, from a certain point of view--a speed run through the market, blitzing and confusing everyone watching--throwing a ton of money at hedge funds' short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole.  Of course people are getting jumpy.

# Battleground - Strategy and Tactics

In a way, GME has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people.  Wall Street vs WSB is basically the way it's been depicted in the media, and a number of them seem to be taking it personally.

With a battleground stock I find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground, but with territory marked out by stock price.  It helps you consider the impact on each 'side', what their motives are, and tactical and strategic implications.  The reason I think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground, the issue is no longer about price discovery--it's about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal, which changes the dynamics of the trade.

In my opinion, the retail strength/defensive line is at the $148 level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week.  This is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from $30 to $148, which triggered the first squeeze.

My guess is short-side strength hardens at the $350 level, based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze.  What this means is that you can expect some short-side people to actively short more at that level, possibly following through on momentum, as many of them want to prove a point that GME is a <$20 stock, as stated by a number of them on CNBC.  $350 might seem like a low number given Friday's close, but remember that Friday trading was subject to the uptick rule, so the short effectively could not push back, and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the long-side advance as much as possible, and lure them off their strength as much as possible.

Say what?  Is there a point to those analogies like that?  Why yes, of course, because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign.

Remember, in the grand scheme of things, the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float.  That means buying and holding shares.  The question is.. how much will it cost you to move the needle on that, so to speak.  the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float, the longer it'll take and the more expensive it will be.  It is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect, in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels, such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out, loosening float back up.

How about on the long side?  You want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum, and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so.  This means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair.  Why?  Because it means you're buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price (costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float) and also that their short position is at a lower average price, lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze.

The above is why, in some cases, you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze.  You can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points, which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning.  Once you think you've accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move, you spike the price back the other way and it's effectively game over.  It can take some time to play out to its conclusion, but that is the essence of it.

Let's make it concrete and put some numbers to it.  let's say you need to lock up 10mio more shares for the squeeze (no idea, just using the number for easy math).  If you can buy it all skirmishing at the $200 line, you'll pay $2bn to do it.  If instead you've extended to the $300 line, you're going to pay $3bn.  If you're an alpha-seeking whale, why pay 50% more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it?  If you recall, I referenced seeing what I thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my 3rd post.

That being said, you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think you're already close to blowing up the next short interest holder.

If you think you're close, then you're looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible.

That is very similar to the price action we saw on Friday at the end of the day, as mentioned earlier.  If you think about it, if the goal is the have the price at/above a certain point at the end of the day, what is more efficient?  Rush in the morning, then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it, or wait until later in the day, as late as you think you can manage, and then push to that point at the very last tick?

That, at least, is a very high level view of what you're trying to accomplish, but it gets very complicated in the details.  If you're dueling with a good HFT algorithm, you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock (kind of like fouling someone in basketball), which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider LU/LD allowances, but still doable, even if you have to do it by sucking price level up (maybe to give you 5 mins to call your buddy at Blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that).

Another thing to keep in mind.  One of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time, is it might not be a one and done blowout (possibly on purpose).  Think about it--if you can get people to keep piling short interest in--particularly for emotional reasons, you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point.  Think of the Citron guy who re-shorted back in around what.. $90 or $100 I think?  All because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of $30.  There are people piling back in right now.  Who knows how many times they're willing to reload the short float.

Ok, so this post is much longer than I originally intended anyway, but I think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion.  A number of people asked me why I said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point.  If you haven't already figured out why, try to think about it, or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion.

A couple of final points:

* Assuming the long-side people continue to lock up liquid float, remember that volatility can get greater in BOTH directions.  This can mean that you get wiped out if you're somehow still trading GME on margin, as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later.
* Greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside.  Pre-market and after hours trading don't have circuit breakers, so it could get wild during those times too.
* Also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently.  After the first frustrating day of this happening with GME I made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so I'd have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen.  For those of you on ToS, use it on the 1 minute chart.  Note that the LULD tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day, so you'd have to adjust the parameters (or just keep it in mind).  I use it with the step lines vs the default line.  If price crosses the guard lines then you're getting close--if it crosses the circuit breaker line then you're about to be or already are getting halted.  Here is the code:

&#8203;

    input TrailingPeriodLength = 5;
    input CircuitBreakerPercent = 10.0;
    input GuardMultiplePercent = 70.0;
    
    def trlAvg = Average(close, TrailingPeriodLength);
    
    plot trailingAverage = trlAvg;
    
    plot upperStop = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);
    plot lowerStop = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);
    
    plot upperRail = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);
    plot lowerRail = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);

Also, I got a comment in another post telling me to get a job lol.  Actually I have one, so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to post from Monday forward.  As I've mentioned in a few comments on prior posts, I actually am not active on social media normally.  I just created this account to try to help people use this probably once-in-a-lifetime event and the intense interest it's generating to help people learn to become better investors and traders.  I'll try to keep posting, but maybe not as regularly, and probably shorter (which I know some of you will be happy about :)).

95 years ago the US levied the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, worldwide tariffs that were designed to encourage domestic production and punish ""cheating countries"". This kicked off a trade war that had no small part in causing a world-wide depression. 

The US has not levied global tariffs of this degree since then. Until yesterday.

What happened to US equities?  After a roaring bull run during which wealth was printed and the every-day man flung money in the market it crashed. But not overnight. In fits and starts the DJI lost 90% of its value over a 3 year period. 

It took *25* years for it to return to an ATH. 

Trump has fired 10s of thousands of federal employees. He's spiking unemployment. He's taxing imports to the tune of 50-100%. Other countries will do the same to us. Our companies will start having mass layoffs, crushing economic activity and investment. Domestic production will not return, everyone one will be out of money to buy stuff anyways. The SH tariffs did nothing to encourage domestic manufacturing, it just made everyone poorer. 

Maybe our monetary policy will prevent a Great Depression and we escape with ""only"" 8-10 percent unemployment, mild stagflation and the market takes 3-5 years to recover after a 50% fall.

""Canada has frozen $43 million in payments to Tesla pending a line-by-line investigation into its last-minute surge in EV rebate claims made on the final weekend of the government program.

The American EV maker run by U.S. presidential adviser Elon Musk will also be excluded from all future EV rebate programs as long as tariffs are in place, former transport minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.

The stop-payment order appears to have been made before the current election was called Sunday, though Freeland only confirmed it Tuesday, while on the campaign trail for her University—Rosedale seat.

“As soon as I became Transport Minister, I asked the department to stop all payments for Tesla vehicles in order to fully examine each claim individually and determine whether all are eligible and valid. No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid,” she said in a statement texted to the Star.

“I also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentive programs so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.”""

Tesla's earnings in the first quarter were $438 million.

$101 million (23%) of that came from selling Bitcoin for profit.

The other interesting part is that it would have been an earnings miss without the trading.

Did one make the other happen?

Considering the recent news about not allowing Bitcoin anymore, it's certainly a move worth mentioning.

1jq4hf3,2025-04-02,2025-04-02 20:28:52,US Senate passed bill by slim margin in a 51-48 vote to block Trump's tariffs on imports from Canada,"4 Republicans cross the floor to vote with Democrats to pass a bill that would remove import tariffs on Canadian goods.

This still needs to pass the house (which has republican majority), and even if it passes the house, president can still veto. At which point it goes back to the senate and 2/3 need to vote to overturn the veto.

Low chance, but indication that dissent is happening within party lines given the economic downturn of tariff policy.

Interesting to see how many more house reps and senators break from party lines after today's ""liberation"" tariffs have time to impact markets and consumer prices

The bottom line was that Chamath was pushing the point that Hedge funds have had the advantage until now, but with social media being where it is, a bunch of retail investors with a cellphone can take the other side of a trade and be effective at it.

&#x200B;

I felt that Scott Wapner was pushing for him to admit  that GME is horribly mispriced, which it really is on  massive scale, but Chamath did not give him that, instead pushing the narrative that the hedge funds being 200% short the float is what is really wrong and the time has come where retail traders are leveling the playing field.

I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.

Wow, what a week.  All I'll say on that for now.  I'll maybe do a recap of Friday at some point this weekend if I can.

For this post, rather than a narrative recap, I'll go into some very light technical analysis on a couple of screenshots from TD Ameritrade Thinkorswim and Ortex.  I don't have a lot of time to go very deep into everything I normally do, but I wanted to give the newer traders an example of how I go about coming to some of my conclusions.

Some of the conclusions I came to in the heat of the moment in my previous posts may also not stand up to more rigorous scrutiny of the data.  In my opinion, at least, it's very important to ensure that you go back and review any of your high conviction trades from time to time.  Please feel free to use the charts I'll show to challenge some of the assumptions I may have made and written about while watching the live ticker tape action, social media, and other high-frequency sentiment indicators (things I might rely on for a hyper-realtime momentum monster trade like GME has been this past week).  Maybe use them to challenge your own thoughts and assumptions as well.

I realized while doing this that writing those prior articles probably cost me \~$300k in momentum trade opportunity LOL, since I used all of my free non-trading hour time to write instead of do an even more in-depth version of what I'm going to show you now.  That being said, if that writing helped any of you understand what was going on, and ultimately progress on your way to becoming better traders and investors, that to me is well worth it--maybe one day you too can pay it forward!

# Fundamentals - Ortex Short Interest

First, lots of questions on the prior post about Short Interest remaining on GME so I'll start with this one.  Looks good to me.  I think Ortex will update end of trading Friday data just before/around Monday market open.  I consider this chart to convey mostly fundamental data, as the underlying value thesis behind the recent push by retail traders has at least recently been about the squeeze.  This is the type of data you'd use to try to analyze data about the security being traded.  Note that most pro traders would not consider short interest to be a 'fundamental ' attribute, and normally I'd agree, but I think GME and maybe some of the other high SI plays are an exception to that.

If any of you are inclined to feel jumpy about the diving lines on the chart, make sure to look at the axis values on the left.  The chart is calibrated to capture the movement over the period, so the bottom of the axes are not 0.

A few things to note:

1. Short interest drops substantially from 1/26 into 1/27
2. Volume is shrinking
3. Remaining free float on loan has gone down, but at 66% as of Thursday, is still quite high

# Overview - Daily Chart & Summary of the Week

A few things going on here

1. The big volume days on Friday, Monday, and Tuesday are when it seems to me that the greatest retail momentum would have occurred.  The battles were pretty intense at key price points if you take a closer look at those intra-day charts.
2. Big picture here, what it tells me is that many if not most of the retail share volume was acquired at or below $148 on huge volume.  That means the core of your retail support, and the majority of shares in WSB diamond hands would have been bought probably between the $30 and $148 price range.  My guess is that Only DFV the DFV early acolytes, Dr. Burry, and the institutional holders have meaningful volume below $30.
3. Given points 1 and 2, I'd consider the $148 price level as the critical defense level of your earliest, hardest retail support.  You can dive deeper into the 1/26 trading day and possibly make a case for other levels as well, but I'll roll with that for now.
4. Ok, so maybe the Melvin guys weren't really lying.  The Ortex data showing short interest drop from 1/26 to 1/27 coinciding with the massive and sudden price dislocation upward on 1/27.
5. If new shorts entered the game it would have been near the highs, possibly selling into the forced buying of what I'll just assume was the overnight Melvin squeeze and into the early market  hours on 1/28.  Possibly aggressive momentum shorting on top of the Robin Hood BS, the bots, and the networking issues came together in a perfect storm with that HFT ladder attack on the vertical dive.  Wow--no wonder that thing was so intense.
6. As you can see on that downside wick on 1/28, the huge momentum briefly pierced the Retail line before being slammed back up.  We'll take a closer look in the fibonacci chart.

# Analysis - Mini Squeeze Hourly

Just a few notes. I checked and the after hours volume here was sudden, quite unusual, and pretty consistent with a forced liquidation of a substantial position.  Rather than slamming it all out at once, the broker spread it out quite a bit.  Some takeaways:

1. If you wanted to take money from Melvin, this was the chance, and a lot of people (or a few whales) certainly did.  The numbers in my summary were very quick mental math of the hourly volumes in overnight trading
2. The price didn't break away as aggressively as it probably could have, which means there was some carefully calibrated pre-planning to unload a bunch of shares, laddering up to the $350 level.
3. I am genuinely sorry to have to conclude, therefore, that the WSB bros with the $420.00 limit got scooped. Something on the order of 17 million shares worth of Melvin dollars got cashed out under them by a HFT whale with access to firehose shares at Melvin's broker all the way through overnight trading.  few retail even have the ability to trade for that entire window, and certainly not on the order of 17 million shares anyway.
4. Another important takeaway: 17 million shares is a lot, but it's nowhere near the entire original SI in GME.  The Game hasn't necessarily Stopped yet (heh).

# Technical Analysis - 1/28 to 1/29 Fibonacci Retracement

For those of you who are unfamiliar with what traders call ""technical analysis"", it's really just a fancy set of words to say looking at squiggly lines, bars, etc. on charts to try to figure out what's going on.

One particularly popular tool is called a fibonacci retracement.  It sounds a lot fancier than it is, but it is extremely useful, and extremely commonly used by momentum traders (which is partly why it's useful--if everyone is trading off of the same thing, it's a self-reinforcing bias in the market).  There is a lot of background reading you can do on the topic--I recommend it.  You'll be a better trader and even investor for it, as it tends to be useful even on longer timeframe charts.  Kind of uncanny really.

Looking at this chart I realize I probably should have plotted the 'retail line of defense' here too.  Oh well, maybe next time.

Takeaways:

1. I figured the relevant trading range going forward was peak euphoria to peak despair in regular trading on relatively good volume.  That happened to be the top to bottom move on the Robin Hood news.
2. Using that for the fibonacci retracement, you can see how much of the trading action bounces around between the various levels before settling in scarily accurately into the 50% - 61.8% channel in after hours trading.
3. it's quite possible that short-term equilibrium on this battleground stock is $300 to $350 until either side makes a strong push.  Price was trapped in that range toward the end of normal trading on relatively good volume.
4. Probably a bunch of momentum traders drew exactly this retracement (or something very similar) for their rest of day trading after the floor got put in near the retail line of defense.  In all honesty it's hard to say if the tool works because of some fundamental reason or because everyone uses it so everyone times their momentum plays off the same playbook, making it self-reinforcing.  All that matters in the end is that it works pretty consistently once you get used to working with it.
5. Below the price graph, pay attention to the volume bars below.  It's especially critical when trading momentum to understand the relationship between share volume and price, as there are patterns that are more likely to play out depending on the relationship.  For example, when price is moving around a lot, is it doing so on high volume or not much volume?
6. Traders tend to overshoot a little on each push, so even if price ultimately drops lower after an upside spike, if the volume on that drop is low compared to the upward push, that actually tells you that it's likely to go higher a little later on.  There are many sites that go more in depth into this kind of thing (patterns, volume and price analysis, etc.), and it is incredibly useful to try to understand what to take away from price and volume movement as you watch it unfold live.

Lots more going on here, but this post is getting pretty long already.

# Other Takeaways

* The whales in the pond obviously do their homework (that's how they got to be that big, after all), and they were therefore prepared to act decisively to unload 17 million shares at the upper end of the trading range when Melvin got blown up.  That's how you make big bank on big volume--do your homework.
* My thesis in the [part 2 article](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l6xc8l/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_2/) that the big early drop before retail pre-market was a short-side scare tactic could very well be totally wrong.  You could make a case either way that it was a new short-side player diving in at a higher price point, a  long-side whale making bank, or a combo of both.  if you check the Ortex data against the numbers here you can probably come up with an order of magnitude educated estimate.  If so, apologies to the CNBC Squawk Box crew--probably no factual inaccuracies in your reporting (though the tone did make a lot of retail panic)
* Ironically, it might very well have been the continued unwinding of Melvin's short position that intercepted the panic drop into premarket rather than a long-side heavy hitter.  LOL.
* Thursday afternoon and Friday were low volume, low-conviction momentum sloshing around.  Dueling HFT algos and momentum traders trying to scalp alpha from each other is my guess.
* Contract expiration may cause a price dislocation into the new trading week, so I'm not sure the fibonacci retracement chart is still useful.
* I'm sure if I go back over my previous articles and compare to the chart data more carefully I'll find all kinds of other inconsistencies with my realtime thoughts.  It's key when trading, at least in my opinion, that you are willing, able, and indeed eager to go back and rethink your assumptions, no matter how much you liked them. Challenge and verify with data whenever possible.  Not doing that is how Melvin got blown up, after all.
* My worst case scenario thesis in the [part 3 article](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/) may still be valid depending on the total amount of short interest loading up into GME at these newer highs.  I remember hearing some fund manager talking about shorting GME at the $400 as a stabilization mechanism.  Wow.. short something with the most hyper volatility of any $1bn+ stock I've ever heard of... for stability.  That's not a word I'd ever associate with a WSB meme momentum rollercoaster stock.
* An infinity squeeze is still totally on the table, as long as sufficient short interest remains.  The strategy and tactics you'd use to get there may have to be different though, as price ratchets up into higher bands. I'll keep those thoughts to myself--for sure those WSB guys have a plan.  They've proven to be scary effective so far after all.

There are other things you can take away, or theses you can come up with from these and other charts you may have access to.  Hopefully, for you newer traders I've given you a useful glimpse into how I might try to use readily available data to improve/challenge/refine a working thesis to ensure I'm better prepared for the days ahead.

""If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae.""  Not being able to get your hands on critical materials could be devastating. REEs are involved in far more modern tech than people realize (see article 1 below).  
  
China controls 90%+ of the global heavy rare earth mining and refining, and has a stranglehold on some (but not all) of the light and medium rare earths as well. As such, they absolutely holds the cards to the entire US trade war and everyone needs to watch closely how far they are willing to escalate. The below articles will bring you up to speed on just how critical these medium and heavy rare earths are. If tariffs are glorified saber rattling, this is a straight up shot just above the bow.

What does this have to do with investing? There are a handful or so of REE projects in various stages that could be killer investments in the coming months or years. ASM in Australia, LEM (of which I am invested) and SCD in Canada, as well as a few projects in north, central and south, America who's names escape me. The various Greenland REE projects are also possible punts that might be good for a bubble play, but they have major hurdles to economic production, more so than the others IMHOP.  Most of the REE projects around the world have major hurdles but that's just where the industry is. 

Either way, outside of investing in the REE space, these recent export controls could affects dozens of global industries that affect our everyday lives so watch this space particularly. I suspect the mainstream media won't give this the attention is deserves.

lh2by7,2021-02-10,2021-02-10 15:00:59,I am no longer picking stocks. It's ETFs for me.,"I've been investing for a couple years. Most of my stock picks have been large cap companies, lots of tech and consumer products. I follow trends, buy the dip, yadda yadda.

About a year ago I started putting extra money into ETFs. For those, I have focused on tech heavy funds, clean energy, next gen stuff- all Vanguard or low cost funds. Now that my portfolio is split evenly between individual stocks and ETFs, I've noticed a surprising trend:

My ETFs beat my stock picks almost every day. Today is a great example- in a mixed market, my individual stocks are (collectively) down -$195, but my ETFs are (collectively) up $110. And it is like this fairly consistently. On a good day for the markets as a whole, my ETFs are always beating my stock picks. Sure, there are times I have an individual stock that might pop and outperform my ETFs, but more regularly, my collective stock picks rarely outperform my collection of ETF picks.

I guess I am just saying that I am done trying to pick the next winning stock, spending my valuable time pouring over charts and digging through the news for rumors. I am liquidating my individual stocks and dumping it all back into my ETF picks at the next market dip.

[edit] SO MANY PEOPLE asking what my ETF picks are. I am not a financial expert, so I don't claim that these are the best, but I have: VGT QQQJ VOO SCHA ARKK and VBIX (which is a mutual fund, not an ETF).

lt7oop,2021-02-26,2021-02-26 15:59:34,JPMorgan advises clients to expose 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin,"In a recent note to clients, strategists from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. However, they advised clients to allocate a small percentage due to the risk of major downturns in Bitcoin’s value.

After setting a new all-time high above $58,000, the value of the digital asset slumped to less than $45,000 and has been struggling to recover ever since.

Chang and Ho told investors:

>*In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.*

Bitcoin has welcomed major investments from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and MicroStrategy. The endorsement from JPM comes at a time when institutional players are rushing to accumulate the digital asset. As per Bloomberg’s report, America’s oldest bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has also announced plans to enable Bitcoin transactions for its clients.

The strategists were quick to add that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as an investment vehicle and opposed to being funding currencies like the USD or EUR. This appears to be contrary to earlier statements from other JPM analysts that called cryptocurrencies the “poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.”

l5l413,2021-01-26,2021-01-26 14:11:37,Gamestop Big Picture: The Short Singularity,"*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.*

There are numerous posts on this sub and others diving into the technical guts behind some of the recent moves behind GME, so I will keep it high level for everyone scratching their heads wondering what's going on.

There has been much talk on CNBC and in other financial media calling what's happening in GME a distortion of the market and an unjustifiable departure from the fundamentals. That is undeniably true. That being said, the distortion is not what's playing out now, but rather what happened about 1.5 years ago when short interest in GME first began to approach (and later exceed) 100% of the available float.

Short selling is usually a tool that aids in price discovery, but like most market mechanisms, at the extremes things get more complicated.

Short sellers, having borrowed shares, are guaranteed (indeed obligated) future buyers of the stock. They put themselves in that position on the thesis that there are reasons to expect the stock price to go down, such that when they buy the shares back they can return what they borrowed at a lower price and pocket the difference. As such, as short interest grows, there is a short term downard push on the price (the initial sale of the borrowed shares), but also future upside pull on the stock price as a natural result, kind of like gravity, but pulling the price upward. Normally that pressure is so slight and subtle that short interest in and of itself should not be a mover of the stock price.

That being said, a common rule of thumb is that you should start to concern yourself with that pressure when short interest crosses the threshold of between 20% and 25% of the effective float (shares actually available to trade). At that level and above, the pressure starts to become noticeable, kind of like the moon causing currents and tides.

GME short interest was recently **140%** of the float. In recent days, short interest has actually continued to accumulate (I'll explain why later).

There is, in effect, a critical mass of short interest hanging over GME's price exerting not subtle pull, but face-ripping force like the gravity of a black hole. A short singularity, if you will.

Previous short squeeze case studies such as VW or KBIO were all about someone engineering a way for effective float to evaporate, suddenly leaving what was previously a relatively reasonable aggregate short interest position in a world of hurt. This is the first time where we're seeing a situation play out where it wasn't someone engineering a shrinkage of effective float, but large market-moving players simply blowing up the short interest to the point where it simply overtook effective float by a large margin. Why would they do that? Because they expected GME to declare bankruptcy in the very near term so that returning borrowed shares costs $0, as the shares are worthless at that point. Also, an arguably intentional side-effect of this massive artificial sell-side pressure on the stock is that it becomes more difficult for GME to obtain any kind of financing to avoid bankruptcy, making it, in theory, a self-fulfilling prophecy. GME, however, did not go bankrupt for reasons that are well explained by other posters.

In order to close their positions and limit their exposure (which remains theoretically infinite otherwise), short interest holders need to collectively buy back more shares than are available on the market, and especially since GME is no longer at risk of imminent bankruptcy, that buying action would push the price into a parabolic upward move, likely forcing brokers to liquidate short interest-holding accounts across the board on the way to buy shares at any price to cover their otherwise infinite liability exposure (and that forced covering will push the price further upward into a feedback loop--like crossing the event horizon of the black hole in our analogy).

So what is happening now, and where do we go from here?

Right now, short-side interests are desperately trying to drive the price down. There has been an across-the-board media blitz to try to scare investors away from GME. But there is really only one way to drive price down directly, and that is selling. In fact, given that most of the large holders of GME long positions are simply sitting on their shares, it means selling. even. more. shares. short.

Even as price has been grinding upward, and liquidity has been evaporating, short sellers, who have lost billions mark-to-market currently (my guess is on the order of $10bn by the end of trading today), can only keep selling, piling on even more exposure and losses, staving off oblivion hour by hour, minute by minute.

GME might also decide to issue more shares to recapitalize its business on the back of the elevated share price, but it is unlikely they could issue enough shares to change the overall trajectory of the stock at this point (especially not given their fiduciary responsibility to current stock holders). It might, however, run the clock out a little while longer.

At this point it looks like there will either be some type of external market intervention by regulators (though I can't see any reason for them to step in myself), or we will soon see what happens when short positions representing \~$8bn in current mark-to-market liability goes parabolic.

ldrsgq,2021-02-06,2021-02-06 01:40:06,"A story about the Dot Com bubble, some profit taking, exit strategies and money vs capital","
[ Bot hates me so here is a link](http://www.bloomberg.com/news)

In the late 90's we had a similar Tech/Digital stock rally (this is not nearly as bad though, so chill, companies are actually destroying the estimates and profits are strong).

Back then it was web page development and internet providers, now it's mainly electric vehicles and some parts of tech. 

“St0nks” were only going up, up and up. You heard things like - Dude, its a new economy, this is the new normal. This is the future, you can't use old models to define value. Die all boomers and burn traditional stocks (ok I might be exaggerating on this one). 

Anyway, I was a finance major at a prominent university in London, UK. I was destined for greatness and a trainee spot at Deutsche Bank's analyst desk. My friend - let's call him Eli, because his name was actually Eli - was a stock genius. 

Everybody is a genious in a bull market, you put some money in to a company in IT and BAM, the new Buffett (or Cathie).

Eli was good for about 350kUSD at one point, not bad for a student. Or I should say, 350kUSD nominal value in stocks. Because, its not money until you sell. Eli learned the hard way.

The ""dip"" came. Eli figured ""st0nks only go up"" - I'm gonna ""buy the dip"". The dip became a slide, then a vortex and finally evolving in to a capital sucking black hole (not an anus ok).

Eli bought and bought, he also had a debt position of about 25% of his portfolio. This increased to 50%. The bank called, Hey Eli - that collateral isn't so hot anymore, pay up dude. Eli paid up. One year later he had -13kUSD on his account for accrued interest rates and trading fees.



So what's there to learn. Well, depends on how risk averse you are, but I see a lot of new investors that ask about when and how to take home profits. There is no rule or best practice, but here's at least an strategy that I'm using myself.


1. I  usually don't let a stock grow beyond 20% of my portolio, if it does I start scaling back profits and weight to other, new opportunities. The riskier the stock the earlier and more I scale back.

Compound that interest, bitch.

2. I always keep a 10-15% cash position so I can take advantage on dips or other opportunities. This capital has had a ridiculous payback over the years. This is not money, this is capital. I have a savings account with 3 months salary. That’s money. Money pays bills, capital grows.

3. For every 20% growth I take home for example 20% of the profit in riskier playa. So in G-ME for example I started buying early and by $90 I only had profits invested. By 300 I had sold about 2/3 and on the way down I dropped the last stocks at 115. 

So let’s say a stock grows from 100 to 120. I take back 4. Then it goes to 140, I take back another 8 so now I have taken 12 total. 

Obviously there is some flexibility here, but use it for inspiration. For more secure stocks you want to hold on more and longer, but for me it’s a lot about maintaining that cash position.


So what do I do with my profits? Well, I do a few things. 


1. I reinvest them in to other stocks, so I make sure I have a short list of alternatives at all times.  For example, my G-ME winnings (yes it was a casino) paid for 300 PayPal stocks at $231. They’re now up 15%. 

Compound that interest, bitch.


2. I put them in the cash position so I can be opportunistic (but still max 15%). Life saver in March, pure rocket fuel baby. 


3. I buy my wife or kids presents, I get a nice Rolex or refurbish the house.  I turn it in to money. I have money so I can spend it, use it. 



Moral of the story or TLDR;

Make money, you probably won't see another opportunity like the one of the past 6-10 months. Its not coming back for a while. 

Don't step out of the market, pick your stocks wisely, keep some cash to pounce on some disappointing earning calls or dips and remember: IT IS NOT MONEY UNTIL YOU SELL.

Disclaimer 2: I was a licensed financial advisor as in a securities analyst, but do your own research. This is not advice, it’s inspiration.

PS Eli went on to be a very successful entrepreneur and has started a few companies. I believe one of them is going to IPO soon DS

Hi guys just wanted to put things in perspective for you all since some of you seem to be quite nervous with the recent week of stock movement. 

I've summarised a list all stock market crashes since 1950. There has been 7 stock market crashes since 1950, averaging one every 10 years. 

The stock market crashes ranges from inflation (10%+), to oil price rises (4x) due to war, dot com bubble, housing market collapse, covid-19 etc.

The graph is a log graph meaning that the space changes are proportional to the percentage change. This is useful for looking at long term charts since the % change for a dollar increase is smaller as the index value goes up.

The S&P 500 has averaged a compound annual growth rate of 8.22% since 1950. This is illustrated by the trend lines, and as you can see the S&P 500 is trading right in the middle of the range (the two blue trend lines). 

I noted a few reasons in the box for each crash for a brief understanding of why it had happened. Note, that the only one with a 'fear of overvaluation' was only the dotcom crash where the PE's were over 200 and many companies were just cash burning shells with massive negative free cash flows.

I'm not saying a crash / correction won't happen, but i just wanted to put things into perspective and give a bigger picture of the overall stock market since pretty much before all of us were born. 

By no means am i an economist but I didn't include anything earlier than 1950s because that was pre WW2/WW1 - before the US was a superpower / the global financial hub / USD = world trade currency etc.

Edit: some of you noted that its only 8.22% if you bought at the start but I want to clarify that yes and no! Yes for the people that literally buy in once once at the beginning of 1950.

No because if you buy throughout the years (DCA every month let's say) you'll buy within the range - both lower and higher range! So it's more or less 8%! For example during 1960s-1980s the sp500 traded sideways! So if you constantly bought in those 20 years, the accumulation of money in this period would have a higher CAGR of > 8% because of where it is in the range. Just follow the lines! It makes it easier. There's roughly same amount of periods above and below the middle trend line.

Edit: Changed enron scandal to lehman brothers as some pointed out my mistake.

Edit: Further Log Graph explanation (why log is preferred) If the scale has a large range (i.e. 100 to 3000) then log should be used because its important to show the % changes as opposed to the point changes. A 1 point increase in the SP500 now is only 1/3811 = 0.02% whereas a 1 point increase 10 years ago was 1/1000= 0.1%. It's important to look at it in terms of % change because companies grow in terms of % as well. For example you don't quote apple has grown its business by 30 billion this year ( random number), instead you say apple grew its sales by 20% this year. Its so that its comparable.",4373,901,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lujnvo/sp_500_since_1950_graph_showing_all_crashes/,all,Unknown,0.98

Will it lead to lower consumer demand in an already weak US consumer?

Will it lead to higher profits for US based companies? Don't most US companies manufacturer outside of the US, so their operating costs/COGS will increase?

l3z5jq,2021-01-24,2021-01-24 08:09:56,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

nrw7cv,2021-06-04,2021-06-04 00:08:46,Biden bans US investment in Chinese military and tech surveillance sectors,"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/03/biden-bans-us-investment-chinese-military-tech-surveillance

Joe Biden has signed an executive order that bans American entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.

In a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, the US treasury will enforce and update on a “rolling basis” the new ban list of about 59 companies.

It also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the defense department, senior administration officials told reporters.

The order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.

“In addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside [China] and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,” Biden said.

A White House fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on 2 August.

Major Chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).

SMIC is key to China’s national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.

“We fully expect that in the months ahead … we’ll be adding additional companies to the new executive order’s restrictions,” one of the senior officials said.

A second official told reporters that the inclusion of Chinese surveillance technology companies expanded the scope of the Trump administration’s initial order last year, which the White House argues was carelessly drafted, leaving it open to court challenges.

The president has been reviewing a number of aspects of US policy toward China, and his administration had extended a deadline for implementation set by Donald Trump’s order while it crafted its new policy framework.

The move is part of Biden’s broader series of steps to counter China, including reinforcing US alliances and pursuing large domestic investments to bolster American economic competitiveness, amid increasingly sour relations between the world’s two most powerful countries.

Biden’s Indo-Pacific policy coordinator, Kurt Campbell, said last month that a period of engagement with China had come to an end and that the dominant paradigm in bilateral ties going forward would be one of competition.

Senior officials said the treasury would give guidance later on what the scope of surveillance technology means, including whether companies are facilitating “repression or serious human rights abuses”.

“We really want to make sure that any future prohibitions are on legally solid ground. So, our first listings really reflect that,” a second senior administration official said.

Investors would have time to “unwind” investments, a third official said.

The new list provided few surprises for investors looking to see if they need to unload even more Chinese stocks and bonds.

But some previously identified companies, such as Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), which is spearheading Chinese efforts to compete with Boeing and Airbus, as well as two companies that had challenged the ban in court, Gowin Semiconductor Corp and Luokung Technology Corp, were not included.

In May, a judge signed an order removing the designation on Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, which was among the more high-profile Chinese technology companies that the Trump administration targeted for alleged ties to China’s military.",4241,265,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nrw7cv/biden_bans_us_investment_in_chinese_military_and/,all,Unknown,0.97

He did a great job saving for college for me and my brother, but he has little savings for his retirement and no investments.

Edit: Should've mentioned I'm 18 and my brother is 16. Currently working my ass off in college. My goal is to get a good job to support myself and my father. Either way, I'm going to make sure he retires. I just want to get him started until I start having my own income.

Edit 2: Alot of helpful advice and I just want to say thank you. Another point to mention is that my dad wants to retire in Egypt, which explains why he’s so not worried about retirement savings. He can live very comfortably off of $1-2k a month there. I’ll be working my ass off to make sure me, my future children, and my father and mother can live a comfortable life. Thanks once again!

This article is short and doesn't elaborate much on what the effects of giving public access to supply and demand data are. Sueing the SEC seems like another way to stifle access to information for retail investors disguised as a means to protect them.

I have a lot of bias right now against institutional entities and I'm interested in what people have to say about this and whether or not this is more sensational news for clicks. I couldn't find a source with specifics about what the SECs overhaul would look like so I'm torn on how I feel about this.

lcftzc,2021-02-04,2021-02-04 08:39:29,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)
3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!
4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year!
5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!
6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.
7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.
8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.
9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

lqfhuz,2021-02-23,2021-02-23 05:42:56,Technology stocks are crashing – what now,"A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.

It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:

* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* S&P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.

Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.

If you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're ""overvalued"". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.

Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.

If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.

So here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with ""I own XYZ because..."". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off. It doesn't belong in your portfolio.

1ix1d6x,2025-02-24,2025-02-24 07:55:33,How is Bitcoin not just a glorified ponzi scheme?,"Genuinely asking, not here to troll. Bitcoin has been popular for 15 years, but it still doesn’t seem to have a mainstream, everyday use. You can’t just walk into most stores and buy groceries or gas with it. Yet, every time it surges, people start calling it ""the future of finance,"" but that future never really happens.

I keep hearing about institutional money coming in, but if it’s mostly hedge funds and whales pushing the price up, how does that make it a real currency? If regular people are just there to provide liquidity for the big dogs, how is this different from a glorified pump-and-dump?

Don't get me wrong I'm a Bitcoin fan and have been buying and selling it for years now. But I cringe everytime I hear “It’s digital gold”.. Gold has a use beyond its speculative value. It can be made into jewelry, art.. People want to have it because its a ‘real’ thing you can hold in your hands! Bitcoin's only real use is making anonymous transactions that regular humans don't usually need to make.

Am I missing something here, or is Bitcoin actually just a bigger fool scheme?

Edit: When you ask the trading AI everyone on tiktok uses ([this one](http://trademind.ca))  It basically says Bitcoin isn’t a Ponzi because there’s no central scammer, no guaranteed payouts, and it still functions even when prices crash. It’s more like a scarce digital asset that people trade, kind of like gold but way more volatile. But that still doesn’t really answer why it hasn’t become a real mainstream currency.

n6dh3d,2021-05-06,2021-05-06 14:04:54,I sold every share I own today.,"I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

So, I am buying the S&P. It's the boring thing to do, but I will be able to sleep at night and not spend everyday inside staring at a screen. I should have done it much sooner.

As we all know, their stock performance is often decoupled from results. Little movement in futures so far, but curious how it’ll move tomorrow. 

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

…

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

Before I get into Monday's action, a couple of things:

I wanted to first give a shout out to /u/piddlesthethug for capturing [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu), which shows that moment in time I referenced in my [third Gamestop post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/), where some poor soul got sniped while sweeping the 29 January 115 calls.  I added it into the post with an edit, but my guess is most who read the post a while back would have missed it.  I guess my mental math in the moment was off as you can see from the image that the cost was actually just shy of $500k rather than $440k as I wrote in the post.  Brutal.

People have also asked me where I stand on this trade.  I was lucky to get in early, trade some momentum, and retain a sizeable core holding (relative to my play account).  As I've mentioned some comments, my core holding, which I will hold until this saga plays itself out, would buy me a new car, all cash.  Though after today I'd have to downgrade from a lower end Lexus to a Corolla lol.

Alright, so, today's action.

I have to admit that I was just glancing at the chart between writing emails, working on excel spreadsheets, conference calls, and meetings.  Whenever I could, I was listening to CNBC in the background, and taking a closer look whenever I heard anything that might move sentiment, or theoretically telegraph an attack as had happened so many times last week.

In my opinion the price action played out almost by-the-numbers according to a squeeze campaign strategy as I laid out in my previous post.  I want to be clear, however, that while it was consistent with what I laid out (liquidity drying up, trying to skirmish at lower and lower price points), you could reasonably interpret it other ways.  As I mentioned in at least one comment, seeing things play out in a manner consistent with your expectations is by no means positive confirmation that your thesis is correct.  It just happens to be consistent with the evidence you have so far.  Always keep that in mind.

I tried responding to a few comments and questions in realtime as I got notifications on my phone.  Just as a heads up, I won't always be able to do so, and it seems like there were a number of knowledgeable people commenting in realtime anyway.  As I've said in comments on my previous posts, I am definitely not the smartest person in the room, so don't just take my word for it just because I'm the original poster.  Please challenge anything I say if you feel I'm mistaken, and don't dismiss out of hand people who may have a different viewpoint.

One thing I thought I noticed in early morning market hours action was that there was no sell order depth above the ticker price, which I interpret as a good sign.  Downward pushes into fairly good volume got sucked back up largely in a low-volume vacuum.  The most extreme example of this was the first push right at market open.  Tons of volume to push the price down, then a tiny fraction of volume as price got sucked back up.  This means very little continued panicking and bailing due to the aggressive push, resulting in gaps to the upside on the follow-on buying.  There were messages and comments from people concerned that low price would let the short side cover, but, as I explained, low price doesn't help the short side unless they can buy at that low price in meaningful volume.  That sort of action where price gaps up as soon as buying (whether by shorts or longs) is driving price tells you that there isn't much meaningful volume to be had at the lower prices.  From a higher level view, volume through the day dropped as price dropped, and that seems to have remained consistently true throughout the day.

There was some very strange after-market volume.  No idea what that may have been, other than maybe hedge unwinding as T+2 contract settlement outcomes were determined.  It seemed, at least to me, to be too much volume in too dense a time window to be retailers bailing out of their accounts en mass.  It would make no sense to do so into the vacuum of after hours anyway rather than the firmer price support of market hours.

I got messages that I was both a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pump and dump fraudster trying to somehow take peoples' money.  My sentiment analysis KPIs thus indicate I'm likely striking a healthy balance (lol).

# The Game (Theory)

Ok, but seriously, is this situation a pump and dump?

Possibly.

I say possibly because, as I stated in a comment, a failed squeeze campaign is effectively identical to a pump and dump in that the only thing that happens is capital is transferred mostly from people who got in later to people who got in earlier.  Even worse, in aggregate a good amount of capital may end up being transferred from the campaigners to the short side.  Not that it was necessarily intended to be that way from the start--it's just what ends up happening if the campaign fails.

Ok, so failure aside, what are the dynamics of the trade?  What kind of game is this?

In simplified terms, I'd describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified [dollar auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction) where the winning side also takes the losing side's bid money.  In other words, at an aggregate level, it's winner take all, go hard or go home, with all the excitement of market action in the middle.  Note that I said in aggregate and with market action in the middle, as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end.  As I mentioned in some comments where I urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money, this is going to be a white-knuckle trade to the very end.

For most of our lives, most of the time, the saying that 'information is power' and the closely related 'knowledge is power' are abstract, philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy.  More tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be 'money is power', or, for the least fortunate, the threat and reality of physical force.

Today, for many in the GME trade, that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance.  What is current SI?  Can you trust numbers from S3?  What about Ortex?  Are there counterfeit shares in play?  What is the significance of Failures to Deliver? Can the short side cover their position off the exchange? etc. etc.

Being in this situation, if nothing else, has lifted the veil for many people.  The right information, in the right circumstances, is incredibly powerful.  It outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry.

If you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor, you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information. Do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated.  Most of all, try to avoid developing a [siege mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_mentality) at all costs.  If nothing else, in my opinion, it's critical for your long-term financial success.

I don't know the answer to those questions definitively, and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything I write.  In fact, it would make me happier if I see people use some of the tools, techniques, and concepts I've tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking.  Catching my mistakes helps me.  Doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone.

# Faith, Conviction, Calculated Risk

Many people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies.

Some people, including those that most Wall Street types consider to be 'responsible' investors, invest on blind faith.  You put your capital is someone else's hands (hopefully a qualified fiduciary), and trust that they will do a good job.  The only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the person(s) in which to place your faith.  This is not entirely unlike what many WSBettors are doing with respect to DFV.  I do this with my retirement accounts, though lately I've been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a self-directed IRA.

Others trade on conviction.  They have, for whatever reason, a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk, and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light.  I consider value investors to fall into this category.

Others are momentum traders and 'technical analysts', who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity.  These opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis.  All that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk.

I think it's healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches.  I personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches mid-trade.  I.e., if you started in the GME trade on faith, it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the no-man's land between faith and conviction, where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade, but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out.  I'm not saying you shouldn't try to make that transition--just try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions.

# Swimming In The Deep

So, the consistent #1 question I always get: what happens next?  My consistent answer, which I know frustrates everyone, is I don't know, and no one else does either.

One person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth, which some may find disturbing, is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the driver's seat.  This may very well be true.  I would give it better than even odds at this point.  In fact, even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade, retail is not a well-organized, monolithic entity, and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times.

Another question I got, which was a very good one to be asking, is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side?  For me, there have been critical actions over the past few days that I would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors, such as the sustained HFT duel into the close on Friday.  That was very consistent, relatively well controlled, and sustained push on volume of 6-7mio shares traded in the $250 - $330/share price range.  Oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of $2bn in capital flow.  That is not retail--particularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time.  The 17mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze (and Ortex reported reduction in short interest) is also definitely not retail.  Others have pointed out massive action in the options today.  Tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high 6 figures.  Not retail.

All of that being said, does that really change very much?  Even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement, and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows (I do, which is why I'm writing these posts and holding that core position), in the end you are trading as an individual.  This is a point that I have made repeatedly.  In the end, you need to know yourself, know your trade, and have a plan.  Your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else (I know many are following DFV to whatever the end may be), but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual.

If my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes, and price grinding down to a floor of harder support, possibly even at the retail line of support (\~$148/$150) I outlined in a prior post.  There may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract T+2 settlement impact.  I don't know enough about what to expect there.  If the squeeze is to happen, unless RH lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum, it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while (maybe days, maybe longer), until sufficient liquid float has been locked up.

Right now options action is heavily weighted to puts, so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price.

If the squeeze fails to happen there won't be a siren, ringing of a bell, or anything like that.  It might happen gradually and non-obviously until suddenly, as only the market seems to be able to do, it becomes obvious that whoever's still there has been left holding the bag.  Hopefully this isn't the case, but if it is I'll be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car lol.

If it succeeds, it should be fairly obvious.  Just don't forget to ring the register!

Either way, this is market history in the making.  As I said in a previous comment, when you ride the rocket, it's definitely not going to be smooth--but it might just be awesome.

Apologies for the lengthy post again.  Good luck in the market!",3836,1192,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lasgrh/gamestop_big_picture_theory_strategy_reality/,all,Unknown,0.96

1jpr1r8,2025-04-02,2025-04-02 11:13:16,4 Republican senators break from party to pass new Democrat resolution to reverse US tariffs on Canada - decision to happen today,"**Edit:** Posts mentioning how Trump's economic policies impact, well... the economy and stocks, are being mass removed from r-stocks due to ""no stocks being mentioned"". I posted the exact same post I did here, there, and outlined both stock names and tickers. Seems like r-stocks mods, don't like hearing about how economy and business is down on the candidate they voted for...

\--

**What stocks this news impacts**

The **STOCKS and TICKERS** that are impacted by this by **economic policy** news are the following: Canadian ETFs (**XIC, EWC**) and Canadian companies that would benefit from a tariff reversal (**NTR, MG**)

**These stocks are expected to be impacted because was reported 2 hours ago that there's enough Republicans that have crossed the floor to work with Dems on a tariff removal resolution (just for Canada, not for the Liberation Day international tariffs)**

\- Democrat Senator Tim Kaine has launched a resolution in the US senate to reverse tariffs on Canadian imports to the US. It's co-sponsored by Senators Amy Klobuchar and Rand Paul.

\- To pass all Democrat senators need to support it, with support from 4 Republican senators. Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins have voiced concerns with tariffs and are expected to support the resolution which would help it pass. Decision was expected either yesterday or today.

**Note**

\- This is not a political post, it makes no comment of if tariffs are good or bad, or if one party is better than the other.

\- The only thing this talks about is a new devolpment that enough senators across both parties may pass an economic policy reversal

\- This was first reported 2 hours ago, and was not previously posted

\- It is relevant to stocks and investing, as the economic outlook for many US/Canada listed stocks will change if tariffs are removed.

President Donald Trump is weighing an executive order which would allow 401k funds to make private-market investments in a huge shakeup to retirement packages.

Trump is expected to announce the new policy soon, but precise details are being kept tightly under wraps and are still subject to change, the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/trump-executive-order-to-help-open-up-401-k-s-to-private-markets-c90c6788?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAjwWmilgZDFvJy8qjnFxRENG-bo7SlS9Aqrc5lOorSRNE-aypKsO8o2&gaa_ts=6877a6bb&gaa_sig=zN_1W3sdTDQgFBuDT-Mg3ZhPusocJ7grCNRW1ZBS8HvwadFsFVbXN4zfNtRdRT61uvZrPpUny7RV-Am6dFO5Lg%3D%3D) reported.

9o9w1u,2018-10-15,2018-10-15 01:24:34,Sears files for bankruptcy,"Per CNBC - After years of [Sears Holdings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SHLD) staying afloat through financial maneuvering and relying on billions of CEO Eddie Lampert's own money, the 125-year-old retailer filed for bankruptcy.

The filing comes more than a decade after Lampert merged Sears and Kmart, hoping that forging together the two struggling discounters would create a more formidable competitor.

It comes after Lampert [shed assets and spun out real estate](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/18/eddie-lampert-says-sears-is-shrinking-shedding-assets-to-stay-alive.html), all to pay down the debt the retailer accumulated when that plan went askew. The company still has roughly 700 stores, which have at times been barren, unstocked by vendors who have lost their trust. Many of the stores have never been visited by a generation of shoppers that can barely recall it was once the the country's biggest retailer.

Lampert, who has a controlling ownership stake in Sears, personally holds some 31 percent of the retailer's shares outstanding, according to FactSet. His hedge fund ESL Investments owns about 19 percent.

Ultimately, it was a $134 million payment that did the company in. The company had a payment due Monday it had not the money to pay.

Other forces were at play too. Sears' creditors refused to agree to a [restructuring proposal](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/sears-ceo-proposes-restructuring-plan-to-avoid-bankruptcy.html). They had little assurance by way of collateral or strategy, after years upon years in which Sears' only shot at survival came by selling off parts of its business. Over 42 quarters, only one yielded positive same-store sales growth. As of late September, Sears tallied $5.6 billion in current debt.

Its board was in a perilous spot. Its special committee was tasked with approving Lampert's other plan, [a bid to buy his storied Kenmore appliance business and other brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/eddie-lamperts-hedge-fund-esl-proposes-to-buy-kenmore-brand-sears-real-estate.html). Approving his offer would have helped Sears make its payment. But it would also thrust the board the spotlight, potentially opening them to the threat of litigation from shareholders who might allege Lampert has stripped the business bare.

#### Homes to Hardware

That business was once a giant. It started with Richard Sears, [who launched the Sears Watch Co. in 1886](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html) to sell watches by mail. The company later evolved into Sears, Roebuck and Co., which sold everything from homes to hardware through a catalog. The convenience brought its products to America's most rural locations.

In 1925, Sears morphed a mail-order plant on Chicago's West Side into its first retail store. By the end of the year. Sears opened seven more stores. Eventually, Sears became the largest U.S. retailer, and its house brands like Kenmore and Craftsman earned spots as staples in homes across the country. Generations of children marked the holidays by paging through its holiday catalog, known as the ""Wishbook,"" wondering if they would receive any of the toys inside.

As Sears success grew, so did its empire. It moved into Chicago's iconic Sears Tower, and for a time, owned financial services businesses like Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group.

But [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) topped Sears as the biggest U.S. retailer in 1990. Its efforts to attract female shoppers by showing them the ""softer side of Sears"" and move into new businesses lines left it without a identity.

Those challenges didn't stop Lampert, the hedge fund manager who had already impressed Wall Street with his acumen when he seemingly turned around Kmart, which he bought in 2004. He acquired and combined Sears with Kmart in 2005, arguing that two ailing retailers were stronger together than apart. The financial guru saw valuable real estate, customers he could parlay from one store to the other and ample costs to cut.

The retail giant he created had a market capitalization north of $20 billion in 2006. The media began to wonder whether he was the ""next Warren Buffett."" Lampert could have sold off his investments then, but stayed on, steadfast in his vision of the combined retailers.

Meanwhile, Walmart and [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT) kept opening stores, as did [Lowe's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LOW)and [Home Depot](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HD). Walmart touted its ""everyday low prices,"" while Target served up ""cheap chic."" Lowe's and Home Depot provided a wider array of home improvement products for all kinds of projects, making it tough for Kenmore and Craftsman to compete.

Then, came a double blow.

Consumer spending slowed during the Great Recession, especially for big-ticket items like washers and dryers. Cash-strapped shoppers began using the internet to hunt down the best deals. Gradually, they began to spend more online and avoid the mall, fueling Amazon's rise. Sears' 140,000-square-foot stores began to seem monstrous as foot traffic declined.

Walmart and others began to invest in their businesses to compete with Amazon, but Sears never had that chance. It simply didn't have the funds.

Sears' last profitable year was in 2010. A thinning cash flow has left little money to put back into the company itself, letting it become more irrelevant. For the past five years, the ratio of Sears' capital expenditures to sales has been less than one percent. That's even as its sales have more than halved in the same time period.

Sears has been in survival mode for more than a decade. Unable to rely on the Sears' business to pay the bills, [Lampert instead sold or spun off many of its most valuable stores and brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html).

Since its merger with Kmart, Sears has spun off its Lands' End clothing brand, sold the Craftsman tool brand to [Stanley Black & Decker](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/) and closed hundreds of stores. It spun out 250 of its best properties into real estate investment trust offshoot known as [Seritage](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SRG).

It has been grappling with a pension of roughly 100,000 retirees that, as of January 2018, was underfunded by $1.5 billion, according FactSet.

It became a guessing game among analysts and onlookers whether each of Sears' last five holiday seasons would be its last. But Lampert kept surprising them, extending a lifeline in the form of loans from his hedge fund ESL Investments, or finding them elsewhere, each time bankruptcy looked inevitable.

Lampert, though, sounded the alarm in a Sept. 13 [blog post](https://blog.searsholdings.com/eddie-lampert/update-on-our-transformation/). He pleaded for Sears' creditor's to agree to restructure, calling out the risks should they drag their feet.

""We continue to believe that it is in the best interests of all our stakeholders to accomplish this as a going concern, rather than alternatives that could result in significant reductions in value,"" he wrote.

By early October, it became evident that Sears' last Christmas before bankruptcy had already passed. Sears began to [raise emergency financing to support the business through coming filing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/sears-arranges-financing-for-a-potential-bankruptcy.html).

lm2mry,2021-02-17,2021-02-17 14:34:47,"BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, is starting to ""dabble"" in Bitcoin","https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/blackrock-has-started-to-dabble-in-bitcoin-says-rick-rieder.html

BlackRock’s Rick Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday the world’s largest asset manager has begun entering the bitcoin space.

The remarks from Rieder, who is BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, came on the same day bitcoin broke above $51,000 for the first time.

“Today the volatility of it is extraordinary, but listen, people are looking for storehouses of value,” Rieder said on “Squawk Box.” “People are looking for places that could appreciate under the assumption that inflation moves higher and that debts are building, so we’ve started to dabble a bit into it.”

In January, BlackRock added bitcoin futures as an potential investment for two of its funds, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds are BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and BlackRock Global Allocation Fund.

A number of other financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and Mastercard, have made entrances into the crypto space in recent days. BNY Mellon, the nation’s oldest bank, will launch a digital assets unit later this year, while Mastercard intends to support certain cryptocurrencies on its formal network.

Electric vehicle maker Tesla also announced last week it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin using cash on its balance sheet and intends to begin accepting the digital coin as payment for its products.

The price of bitcoin has risen more than 70% this year, adding to a major rally that began in the fall. “My sense is the technology has evolved and the regulation has evolved to the point where a number of people find it should be part of the portfolio, so that’s what’s driving the price up,” Rieder said.

Despite bitcoin’s growing respectability as an asset class, Rieder said Wednesday that how much exposure an investor should have “depends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like.”

“We’re holding a lot more cash than we’ve held historically,” he said. “It’s because duration doesn’t work, interest rates don’t work as a hedge and so diversifying into other assets makes some sense. Holding some portion of what you hold in cash in things like crypto seems to make some sense to me, but I wouldn’t espouse a certain allocation or target holding.”",3649,1452,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lm2mry/blackrock_the_worlds_largest_money_manager_is/,all,Unknown,0.97

I mostly contributed up to the company match starting in 2006. I think I had around 10-12k during the 2008 recession. By 2011 I had around 40-45k. Then I was unemployed/student from 2011-2014 so I missed some bullish years. Went back to work in late 2014 and contributed to the company match again.

I maxed it out between 2017-2021. I think in 2019 I had around 90-100k. In 2022 I went back to just the company match cause I had another kid (that would have been the best time to max), then maxed it out again in 2023.

t8taem,2022-03-07,2022-03-07 11:38:57,Biden administration is moving ahead with a ban on Russian oil imports,"WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is willing to move ahead with a ban on Russian oil imports into the United States without the participation of allies in Europe, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

President Joe Biden is expected to hold a video conference call with the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom on Monday as his administration continues to seek their support for a ban on the imports.

The White House is also negotiating with congressional leaders who are working on fast-tracking legislation banning Russian imports, a move that is forcing the administration to work on an expedited timeline, a source told Reuters

**A senior U.S. official told Reuters that no final decision has been made but ""it is likely just the U.S if it happens”**

Oil prices have soared to their highest levels since 2008 due to delays in the potential return of Iranian crude to global markets and as the United States and European allies consider banning Russian imports.

Europe relies on Russia for crude oil and natural gas but has become more open to the idea of banning Russian products. read more The United States relies far less on Russian crude and products, but a ban would help drive prices up and pinch U.S. consumers already seeing historic prices at the gas pump. read more

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a Sunday letter that her chamber is ""exploring"" legislation to ban the import of Russian oil and that Congress intends to enact this week $10 billion in aid for Ukraine in response to Moscow's military invasion of its neighbor.

A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced a bill on Thursday to ban U.S. imports of Russian oil. The bill is getting fast-tracked.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, the White House slapped sanctions on exports of technologies to Russia's refineries and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has never launched.

So far, it has stopped short of targeting Russia's oil and gas exports as the Biden administration weighs the impacts on global oil markets and U.S. energy prices.

Asked if the United States has ruled out banning Russian oil imports unilaterally, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Sunday said: ""I'm not going to rule out taking action one way or another, irrespective of what they do, but everything we've done, the approach starts with coordinating with allies and partners,"" Blinken said.

At the same time, the White House did not deny that Biden might make a trip to Saudi Arabia as the United States seeks to get Riyadh to increase energy production. Axios reported that such a trip was a possibility.

""This is premature speculation and no trip is planned,"" a White House official said.

A year ago Biden shifted U.S. policy away from a focus on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is considered by many to be the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia and next in line to the throne held by the 85-year-old King Salman.

fp4vxy,2020-03-26,2020-03-26 00:04:08,My experience of the 2008 bailout,"I wanted to share my experience of the 2008 bailouts because we are among friends. Right? And friends help each others, and share their experiences. Right?


During the financial crisis of 2008, it became clear that the government had to step in. People were losing their jobs, stock market dropped by more than 30%, the market was going up and down by 5-10% a day (the amount my brokerage accounts would go up or down was more than what I was earning in a month at work). It was humbling.


It was really tough and difficult to trade. Buy on the down days? Sell on the up days? Hold it until sky clears, despite having bled a lot of money already? I was over leveraged too (through LEAP options), which was not the smartest thing to do at the time, but heh, are you going to lock the loss?


Then came the bailout, with a lot of volatility leading to it. A lot of back and forth for days for politicians to get a chance to pass it. (They may have failed to pass the first version even, I don't remember).


Finally, one of the branch passes it, and it's time for the other branch to pass it. ""About time, after the bailout, things are going to get better, we can save those companies, we can move ahead and blue sky is coming.""


I remember at the time, I was looking at the final votes, and I could not believe it. As the votes would come in, and it became clear that the bailout would pass, S&P futures started to drop, like a stone. WTF!!! Help is coming, everything will get better, why is it dropping?


Well, the reason is simple, by signing the bailout, politicians agreed that we were in a shitty situation, companies needed to be saved, and the lousy bailout was getting signed, and there was no more good news down the line for a while. We shot our ammos, and now let's pray. So it became sell the news.


As the market continued dropping days after days, and I was going to be wiped out, I had to sell to not be over leveraged anymore. I had to take a 6 figures loss. And I am fortunate that I sold, because the market continued to significantly tank for almost 6 more months to level I did not think we would reach. After selling, I was not taking as much risk anymore, I got burned hard.


After we reached the bottom, I switched my positions to risky assets, and I was able to make up some of the losses. But that was a great learning experience, and I figured that I preferred to learn that lesson at the time, when my accounts were not too big than later. Recovering from a 6 figures loss is doable, but more than that, and it is a decade or more of setback.


Well, I can say that almost 12 years later (fuck, already!), the situation is very similar.
This time, I was ready, and maybe that will be another post to explain what I did in 2019-2020, as it can be easily applied.


So today:

- People were losing their jobs. Check.

- Stock market dropped by more than 30%. Check.

- The market was going up and down by 5-10% a day. Check.

- Bailout in the process, taking days to agree on. Check.


I am not saying that the market is going to drop after the bailout is voted, but watch out for that.
Unlike 2008, there is no blue sky coming. The bailout is only a short term fix. How long do you think $1200 per person is going to last?


Unlike 2008, we know that the worst is ahead of us. We still don't know. In the US, the coronavirus pandemic is expected to peak in at least 2-3 weeks. But who knows?
As we are doubling every 2-3 days, it could mean 100 times more new cases per day. 100 times more death per day (few weeks later the infection). It's absolutely a staggering and awful number.
Hopefully, lockdown will be enforced in every state, so we can reduce this grow rate.
Hospitals are already over capacity, nobody can tell exactly how this is going to end (except that's going to be a carnage).
Esp. as some are talking about removing the lockdown in 2 weeks!
And even after the peak, it means that people are still getting sick, people are still dying, as they are hospitalized for 2-4 weeks.
Expect at least 1-2 months of pain, even after peak.


I understand that the market is forward looking, but there are still many opportunities for false head starts, and failed bounces from the bottom.


From my experience with the 2008 bailout, nobody could really predict the bottom. Even as it was a financial crisis.
This time, it is not looking pretty, so please don't be like the 2008-me, don't be over-leveraged (yet), things can go either way. Politicians are very good at messing up a crisis.


And most of all, be safe and healthy, stay home as much as you can. It is going to be a rough ride, and unfortunately we are only getting started.
My sincere thoughts for people with friends and families that are going through hardship, sickness and death.
Hang in there!

TL;DR: China has mobilized tons of resources to exporters but there’s some signs of pain,"I’m an American in China but have been seeing very little foreign reporting about what’s happening in China, which is weird to me because it seems pretty important to get a clear picture of the trade war. So here’s what I learned from him.

**Gov support**

-The local government is helping and giving him low interest rate loans / short term financial support. This type of thing is very common throughout China right now - lots of local govs are mobilizing to support exporters thru the tariff war. Li Qiang, central gov minister, says central government help is probably coming too 

-Guangzhou, and I assume others too, has also organized tons of seminars since Liberation Day with buyers from Europe, Latin America, and Asia. A big source of replacement demand for his factory has been from these

-He’s getting lots of buyers from TikTok shops overseas. It seems like TikTok is helping a lot to mitigate the demand impact 

-The news story of Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. resuming some orders is true, he confirmed it. But the amounts are **very, very** small

**Pain**

-He’s already re-evaluating employees and firing some soon. He said most exporters in Guangzhou are cutting some employees, but extremely US dependent exporters have furloughed most of their workforces until mid May

**Some good news for the U.S?**

-Before Liberation Day he was building a factory in the US and has now fully committed to it. But it’s having issues since the raw materials are sourced from China and they’re getting hit with tariffs

[The full interview is here](https://www.yaphete.com/p/live-from-the-trade-war-2-chinas), I didn’t write everything here.

People are comparing them to pets.com, but I don’t think even that company was this blatant at ripping investors off. Their “quarterly report” might as well have been a fat middle finger to both their investors and the SEC.

Oh btw the company is worth around $15B... and some analysts are saying it’s a “buying opportunity” given today’s dip.

**Edit**: for more context on the Pets.com comparison:

Pets.com had annual revenue of $619k for first year, and reached a market cap of $400M at its highest. Crazy bubble right?

Well Nikola has annual revenue of less than $100k (maybe a bit more depends on how many more solar panels the CEO is gonna order for his houses lmao), but reached market cap of $30B at its highest.

It’s literally 500 times more overvalued than the most infamous bubble stock during the dotcom crisis.

**Edit 2**: For the people who argue how revenue doesn't matter because they are the next Tesla.

For comparison. Tesla was founded in 2003 and 5 years later the original Tesla Roadster was on sale. They didn't go IPO until 2 years after that. Elon Musk also had a decent track record, being a co-founder and CEO of this small startup called PayPal.

Meanwhile Nikola Motors was founded in 2004, by a businessman with no real education whose resume is ""fluffy"" at best, and their six years of ""industry leading product development"" has yielded some fantastic CG renderings. 

Can Nikola be the next Tesla? Never say never, especially in the year 2020. But my bet is that Trevor Milton is closer to Elizabeth Holmes than Elon Musk.

lmk8f3,2021-02-18,2021-02-18 06:00:22,Due Diligence of Bitcoin Mining stock valuations: RIOT and MARA,"# Due Diligence of Bitcoin Mining stock valuations: RIOT and MARA

Unlike the 2017/18 rise of Bitcoin, the 2020/21 Bitcoin price action has been largely driven and influenced by institutional demand.

With institutional demand comes institutional products. We have seen bitcoin derivatives, bitcoin trusts, and more recently a new way for exposure to bitcoin price action: publicly traded bitcoin mining companies.

There are two bitcoin mining companies which I'd like to review for you here. Both trade on Nasdaq; they are [**RIOT**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-RIOT/) and [**MARA**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-MARA/).

Lets begin with a quick summary on bitcoin mining.

---

## **What is Bitcoin Mining?**

To mine a new block on the bitcoin blockchain you must find a number called a [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining). The cryptographic combination of the nonce + next block content must be numerically smaller than the network's difficulty target (more on this below). Generating a new nonce is extremely computationally expensive. There is no shortcut, miners must try calculations over and over again until they brute force the correct result. They are trying to find the answer to a math problem; a nonce that hashes correctly with the [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) (cryptographical hashing function).

The bitcoin network adjusts how many computations must be done on average to find a valid nonce every 2 weeks. This is called the [difficulty](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty). The aim is to have a new block mined approximately every 10 minutes. This means that if the mining power is doubled, the difficulty is made 2x harder. Double the energy for the same amount of bitcoin.

We can see an estimate for the [total hash rate being applied to the bitcoin network today](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate).  Notice that it is about 150m TH/s right now (150 million trillion nonces tried every second). So for every block (every 10 minutes) 9*10^22 attempts are done (90 sextillion) until one lucky participant finds a valid nonce and can ""mine"" the next bitcoin block. In doing so they get rewarded 6.25 newly generated bitcoin + some bitcoin in transaction fees from users of the network.

You can run code on your computer to try and find the next bitcoin block. In fact, this is how all bitcoin mining used to be done. However, these days you will end up spending more on electricity than you mine in bitcoin. This is because people have developed special ASIC chips designed specially for brute forcing the SHA-256 function. These chips are a factor of 100 times more efficient than your computer.

---

## **Mining on an ASIC Bitcoin Miner**

The biggest producer of ASIC Bitcoin Miners is a Chinese company called [Bitmain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmain). They produce miners, run many of the miners, and even run many [mining pools](https://antpool.com/) where people can collectively search for the next block and split the profits.

Bitcoin mining becomes incredibly profitable when there is a rapid price increase in bitcoin. This is because there is a lag while new bitcoin mining hardware is being built and deployed to capture excess profit.

So lets take a look at how profitable it is to run an ASIC miner today.

The [Antminer S19 Pro](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020201222165500548JAa69Gvu067A) is one of Bitmain's latest machines.  It can run an impressive 110 TH/s and uses 3250W of power. On their website Bitmain is listing them at $3769 per machine but in bulk companies can buy them for as low as $2333 (notice they are sold out until at least August).

So:

* **$2333 machine cost**
* Using $0.08/kWh electricity costs ([benchmark for electricity cost in China](https://www.ovoenergy.com/guides/energy-guides/average-electricity-prices-kwh.html)) we get 3.25kW * $0.08 = $0.26 per hour in electricity costs. Assuming we run 24/7 this gives us $0.26 * 24 * 365 = **$2278 in electricity costs per year**
* And how many bitcoin will we mine? Well at 110 Th/s on an ASIC machine we are capturing 110/150,000,000 = 0.0000733% of the total bitcoin network per machine **at current total hash rate**. 52,560 bitcoin blocks mined per year; 6.25 bitcoin reward per block + ~1.25 bitcoin in transaction fees (avg right now) -> 7.5 bitcoin per block * 52,560 blocks -> 394.2k bitcoin per year for the entire network. 0.0000733% of this is **0.289 bitcoin per machine per year = $14,450 revenue (at $50k per bitcoin)**
* **$14,450 - $2278 = $12.2k profit per year**

You can play with the parameters to figure out different profit levels. For example, **if the total hash rate doubled to 300m Th/s, profit per machine would drop to $5k per year.**

Also note that transaction fees fluctuate over time depending on how many people are actually using bitcoin (sending and receiving transactions). See [historic transaction fees](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/transaction-fees). 

And how long can you run a machine for?

Running so many calculations slows a machine quickly. Additionally, new faster hardware is introduced making past hardware unprofitable fairly quickly. **As a rule of thumb we can expect a machine to be profitable for about 2 years.** This is also the rate at which companies mark the depreciation of miners on their balance sheet.

In Year 2 the machines become much less profitable than initially.

There have been studies to see where bitcoin mining is occurring through IP address analysis of miners working in pools. The University of Cambridge has a [real-time map](https://cbeci.org/mining_map) in which we can see that in 2020 mining was:

| Country    	| % Total Hash Rate 	|
|------------	|-------------------	|
| China      	| 69%               	|
| Russia     	| 6%                	|
| US         	| 5%                	|
| Kazakhstan 	| 5%                	|
| Malaysia   	| 4%                	|
| Iran       	| 4%                	|

## **RIOT and MARA**

Now that we have a basic overview of how bitcoin mining works let's look our new investment phenomenon: publicly traded NASDAQ listed bitcoin mining companies.

## **RIOT**

Incorporated in July 2000, the company was renamed to Riot Blockchain in October 2017. The company now exclusively mines bitcoin and has a partnership with Coinmint LLC in New York who operate the miners. RIOT was a penny stock for most of its existence and was irrelevant until mid 2020.

How many miners do they have?

* Current status of pre-Dec 2020 orders: [11.5k miners in operation and 10k more to be delivered](https://www.riotblockchain.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/99/riot-blockchain-achieves-milestone-of-1-ehs-in-hash-rate) ([funded from $100m secondary offering in Oct 2020](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320000871/riot_s3.htm))
* In December 2020 their stock price rocketed alongside bitcoin ($3->$15 in 1.5 months). They took advantage of this and ran a secondary offering [raising $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001054/riot_s3.htm). With this money [they ordered 15k more miners for $35m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001096/ex99x1.htm). Expected delivery starts in May 2021 with the bulk to be delivered in October 2021.

**Summary: 37,640 machines at full deployment. 11.5k machines today and won't be running the rest until Q3/Q4.**

So ignoring the cost of the machines:

* Operational 11.5k machines at $12.2k profit per year per machine = $137m
* Full capacity (Q3/Q4) 37.6k machine at $12.2k profit per year per machine = $459m

And assets

* Maybe $150m in cash/btc left over from secondary offering and past assets


Note: They may get cheaper electricity costs through their partnership and claim as low as $0.014 per kwh in some releases.


## **MARA**

Incorporated in 2010, the company has a wild history. It first engaged in the exploration and development of uranium and vanadium, then real estate in Southern California, and most recently patent trolling. The company has some questionable leadership and has also been a penny stock for most of its existence. In 2019 (I think?) the company began delving into bitcoin mining.

In September 2019 they purchased 6k S9 Bitmain miners (13.5 TH/s) for $4m. Notice that at 13.5 TH/s: these machines are far from profitable today (I'm not even sure they were profitable back then!).

So more recently they own:

* Current status of pre-Dec 2020 orders: [6.5k miners in operation and 30k more to be delivered](https://www.marathonpg.com/news/press-releases/detail/1226/bitmain-ships-4000-antminer-s-19-pro-asic-miners-to) ([funded from $100m secondary offering in Aug 2020](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220014870/forms-3.htm))
* In December 2020 ran another secondary offering after their stock price went from $2->$14 in a month. [They raised $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220023410/forms-3.htm). With this money they ordered 70k more miners (delivery of 7k in July, 63k in December) for $168m
* In January 2021 they ran yet another secondary offering raising [$300m more](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315221000864/forms-3asr.htm). They used $150m of this to buy 4.8k bitcoin at $31k per coin

**Summary**

* **Operational 6.5k miners = $79m per yr**
* **Full capacity (Dec 2021) 103k miners = $1.25bn per yr!**

**They also made ~$90m on their bitcoin holdings so far ($150m -> ~$240m)**

Impressive numbers right? Well..

---

## **Too good to be true?**

So what are RIOT and MARA trading at you may ask?

With the recent jump of bitcoin to $50k, RIOT and MARA have rocketed.

* RIOT closed at $77.90 per share, **a market cap of $5.3bn**
* MARA closed at $47.90 per share, **a market cap of $4.5bn**

Investor euphoria is at all time highs. So much so that their price action has rapidly [outpaced](https://i.imgur.com/VjQTaA3.png) and [diverged](https://i.imgur.com/wwzoTn6.png) from bitcoin.

So is it because they have such huge potential? If RIOT gets all of its hardware delivered is it really going to be making $459m per year? And MARA $1.25bn per year!?!

Well, probably not..

* As bitcoin price goes up, mining becomes VERY profitable and there is a rush to build and deploy more hardware. From Oct to Dec 2017 the price of bitcoin famously went from $4k to $20k. Total hash rate went up about 60% during this time. [However, it went up a massive 600% over the following 9 months as new miners were produced and deployed](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty) with a lag.
* As the price of bitcoin capped out and then dipped mining soon became unprofitable at such a high total hash rate and miners lost a lot of money.
* Both RIOT and MARA are pending receipt of the majority of their miners and won't be taking delivery until late 2021/early 2022. What will the network's total hash rate be by then? What will bitcoin price be by then? Chinese miners won't be sitting by idle.
* And we ignored the cost of the machines! In the future RIOT and MARA will need to buy new machines. Regardless of the market the old ASIC miners will quickly trend towards unprofitability. Bitcoin is closed system; There will only be a maximum of 328.5k + tx fees of bitcoin mined per year. In fact, this will reduce in 2024 with the next ""halving"". A company cannot reliably mine more bitcoin/capture more of the network because if they are finding it profitable to increase their hash rate then you can be certain every other miner is doing the same. How many $100m secondary offerings can they do for this free lunch?
* Take a look at the [past financials of these companies](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320000948/riot10qq3-0920.htm). RIOT mined an ""impressive"" $2.4m worth of bitcoin in Q3 2020. Their costs were $1.3m in electricity/rent/etc. + $1.2m depreciation ($2.5m!). Once you add in their $2m of salaries and marketing they had an operating loss of -$2.1m for the quarter. Their bitcoin did appreciate by a cool $385k meaning their net loss for the quarter ended at -$1.7m.
* Of course their next quarter should look wildly better thanks to bitcoins Q4 2020 price action. But this is not a business that is massively profitable under normal market conditions.


The bull case:

* Bitcoin keeps rocketing and never comes back. The total hash rate doesn't catch up and $50k btc becomes $1m btc. MARA's $1.25bn revenue next year becomes $12.5bn before ASIC miner production catches up. Investors doubled their money.


Of course, if it becomes so profitable one wonders if Bitmain decides it is better value to use the miner's themselves and breach their contract.

## **Tobin's Q**

Simply stated, when you invest in a RIOT or MARA you are investing in the profitability/unprofitability of bitcoin mining over the next 1-2 years.

It could be hugely profitable, or it could crash and burn like it did in 2018 and you see no returns.

In this instance, you are paying the executive team of MARA and RIOT to buy the hardware, plug it in, and sell any bitcoin for you. There isn't much more to it than that - you could buy the hardware yourself and run a few machines if you found a good electric company to partner with for cheap electricity.

So perhaps a good way to see what kind of premium you are paying to own bitcoin miner exposure through these NASDAQ companies is the [Q Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin%27s_q). The Q ratio is the market cap of the company divided by the replacement costs of its assets.

RIOT

* Market Cap $5.3bn
* Current btc miners 11.5k ($27m)
* Ordered btc miners 26k ($60m)
* $150m cash remaining (guess)
* **A whopping Q ratio of 22.4! And 63% of that is cash, 25% in orders!**

MARA

* Market Cap $4.5bn
* Current btc miners 6.5k ($15m)
* Ordered btc miners 96.5k ($225m)
* $240m in bitcoin
* $100m cash remaining (guess)
* **A ""value"" Q ratio of 7.75!**

With this approach, RIOT is trading at a 22.4x premium today and MARA a 7.75x.

A criticism of this valuation methodology may be that it is justified paying a premium when orders for new hardware are so backlogged. Just remember that these companies are also stuck in that backlog and won't have most of their machines online until 2022. Is it really worth such a premium?

---

## **Other factors to consider**

These companies have questionable management. **The CEO of MARA has awarded himself [compensation in excess of $300m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315221000469/form8-k.htm) over the last few months. Realise that the market cap of MARA was less than $300m just 3 months ago.**

Both companies are quick to do secondary offering after secondary offering at such high prices. MARA has been more aggressive recently and the downward pressure of insider selling and secondary share offerings has resulted in the price moving from $20->$48 in the time RIOT has gone from $20->$77.

A read through both of their 10-Qs will give you paragraphs of legal claims, shareholder class actions, and past investment write-offs due to corruption/shady circumstances.

These companies have no moat. They have no IP. They have no key talent hires. They are simply ordering ASIC miners, plugging them in, and having the biggest pay-days of their lives.

## **Trading strategies**

So is there a trading strategy I would recommend?

### **Bear**

**The challenge with being a bear in this market is you have to seriously consider whether the risk/reward is there for betting on the downside.**

Right now the market doesn't care for your fundamentals. Bitcoin has passed $50k, the narrative is that its going to $100k. The market expects these stocks to continue to trade at multiples and be 10x higher in a month.

It sounds ridiculous but it keeps happening. It is far too dangerous to be short these stocks. Or worse, short calls and you could be bankrupt on 1 intra-day move.

So that leaves you with puts. Average implied vol nearing 300% does not make them cheap.

If you truly have conviction that there will be a correction in the near term then consider weekly bear spreads.

Longer DTE plays are insanely expensive and run the risk of the many secondary offerings eventually justifying a price higher than your price target.

Another interesting idea would be a relative trade. If you could find exposure to bitcoin mining at <20x premium your long run earnings could net out. However, all publicly traded companies are similarly ludicrous so you'd have to buy a stake in btc mining privately or try and own some ASIC miners yourself.

More simply you could go long bitcoin and short RIOT/MARA. This should converge in the long run. The risk is that short term the short position will be impossible to risk manage and there is always the risk of more secondary offerings.


### **Bull**

Buy as far OTM weekly calls as you can at 400% IV and hope that momentum market continues. Fundamentals are for the 2010s.

---

### **Other**

Both RIOT and MARA's stock price spent some time consolidating down from ~28 to the 16-22 range when bitcoin corrected back from its initial $45k run up back to to $30k.

It is possible they will again if bitcoin has a pullback. However, the price action of these stocks has diverged even from bitcoin for the time being.

Ultimately the price action we are seeing now is purely momentum/hype/technical and probably retail driven. Long term and as far as future earnings go this play is a loser. But be careful; that doesn't seem to matter right now.

kjgtuc,2020-12-24,2020-12-24 10:03:48,Reminder: BABA stock does NOT entitle shareholders to equity in Alibaba,"Been seeing a lot of users posting DD on Alibaba and making a bullish case for it. Seems like the massive drop in share price now should be a fantastic opportunity to pick up the Amazon of China at only a forward P/E of 18 right? Not exactly.

This has been posted before in less detail, but I think it's important to remind investors of the current circumstances arising during the anti-trust probe with China.

The reason why BABA is nose-diving on any extra news of government involvement is that BABA represents ownership of a shell company in the cayman islands, not actually Alibaba itself. The shell company doesn't even have ownership of Alibaba's equity. If you want proof of this, simply open up any of their financial statements filed with the SEC.

Chinese law forbids foreigners from owning strategic assets in the country, and Alibaba wouldn’t be able to keep its licenses if, say, a U.S. hedge fund directly bought into the company.  Basically, the Alibaba stock will buy you a stake in a Cayman Islands-registered entity that is under contract to receive the profit from Alibaba's Chinese assets but will not actually own them. This structure is called a VIE.

So think about this, if Chinese laws prohibit foreigners from owning/investing in these kinds of assets in China, what would protect the shell company in the Caymans from enforcing their contract to receive profits from Alibaba if shit hit the fan with the CCP? If Alibaba gets broken up during anti-trust probes, how do we know which subsidiaries BABA ( the shell company in the caymans) will be contractually obligated to receive profits from? Heck, is this contract to receive profits even enforceable in China, where the law clearly states foreigners can't own strategic investments?

Is this VIE structure even legal in China? Beijing has never acknowledged the legality. According to Harris Bricken, an international law firm:

"" VIEs are illegal. We disagree with those who are saying that what is proposed is a two tier, foreign/Chinese system. ""

We don't know the true answers to the above questions. BABA could easily be worth 0$ if investors one day decide that the ""contract"" to receive profits from Alibaba is basically BS.

Alibaba and Chinese executives come out a winner either way. Alibaba was able to raise billions from foreign investors without giving up a single bit of ownership.

Oh, by the way, all Chinese listed companies on US exchanges are listed as Cayman shell companies, this isn't specific to Alibaba. Baidu and JD are set up the same way.

EDITS:

1. Since many of you are asking, yes NIO is also set up this way. When I said all Chinese companies are listed this way, I literally mean 100%.
2. I don't know why so many high-profile investors still buy these ADR's. My favourite value investor, Bill Miller, also holds a huge position in BABA. I guess you're either in the camp that believes China won't enforce their own laws on foreign ownership so BABA's VIE is undervalued, or that one day they will and so the intrinsic value of BABA's VIE is 0$ because profits can never legally flow to foreign investors.
3. The SEC just last month in a report published in November expressed serious concerns: ""These China-based Issuer VIE structures pose risks to U.S. investors that are not present in other organizational structures. For example, exerting control through contractual arrangements may be less effective than direct equity ownership, and a company may incur substantial costs to enforce the terms of the arrangements, including those relating to the distribution of funds among the entities. Further, the Chinese government could determine that the agreements establishing the VIE structure do not comply with Chinese law and regulations, including those related to restrictions on foreign ownership, which could subject a China-based Issuer to penalties, revocation of business and operating licenses, or forfeiture of ownership interests. "" Source: [https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/disclosure-considerations-china-based-issuers](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/disclosure-considerations-china-based-issuers)
4. After some further research, Mainland Chinese companies listed on the HKE are also VIE's and considered ""offshore"".

1. They sell a ton of gummies and edibles. I don't think legalizing weed is going to drastically change the number of people that smoke it or how they get it. But most people in states that it is not legal in will get to enjoy edibles that were previously unavailable to them. Also edibles are easy to scale up the manufacturer and distribution of.

2. Cresco is an American company. I think believe that the Canadian companies don't have as much potential for growth as American ones do. Just my opinion.

3. Cresco is the nation's largest wholesale distributor. This will be huge when every Tom, Dick and Joe starts opening cannabis shops like starbucks. 

4. They are virtically intergraded. This makes them more nimble and gives them the ability to change fast when the time comes.

She told them she wanted to invest in something that guarantees no loss of principle.  So they sold her $1.2M in 5.15% annuities and $800K in 3% annuities.

She has a mortgage at 2.75 that she pays to the bank with $10,000 monthly mortgage payment on a $1.1M loan.

After fees the 3% annuities pay less than the mortgage.  They tell me it's so she can deduct the mortgage interest.

I was made trustee on her accounts and was pretty shocked.  Her expenses are about $50K a month and they wrapped up 90% of her money that she can't touch for 3-5 years.   She invests exclusively at this bank so they knew her finances.

The good news is that her salary covers the $50K a month, barely.  
She sold her company for a $5M stock merger but can not sell the stock for 2 years.  
Her home equity is about $2M

The bad news is that she has FTD (Frontal Temporal Dementia), hence the trustee bit.  
The really bad news is that she has 3-5 years to live.  And how much longer she can work

I feel like the bank took advantage of he by tying up 90% of her cash.   Her net worth is around $10M so she now has about 2% of her money that she can access.

The bank won't break the annuities unless she pays the penalty.  I'm pretty pissed at the bank and have told them that their investments ""Were not in her clients best interest.""

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable “technology” companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records. Greenspan appealed the decision on March 9 and two weeks later received a letter saying that responsive records were identified, but they could not be released under legal provisions that cover ongoing investigations.

“We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,” the SEC letter stated.

According to the letter, the SEC maintains that releasing the records “could cause harm to the active and ongoing enforcement proceedings because, among other things, individuals and entities of interest in the underlying investigation could fabricate evidence, influence witness testimony and/or destroy or alter certain documents,” in addition to revealing cooperating witnesses and the general scope of the investigation.

The debatable merits of the SEC’s denial aside, an investigation into Softbank may indicate that its risky trading strategy is catching up to the giant. SoftBank unwound its Nasdaq derivative positions by December 2020 after investors questioned its ""controversial strategy"" which could've lost the company billions more. The last look at SB Northstar's books at the end of September showed that it had bought about $17 billion worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4 billion in bets to prop up their prices.

SoftBank did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.",3373,340,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mcpqqp/the_sec_confirms_it_is_investigating_softbank_for/,all,Unknown,0.99

In almost every interview he's asked why is he stacking cash or why Berkshire isn't outperforming the S&P 500. The majority of questions aren't as brazen, but rewatch some of his interviews and you'll see that 1 or 2 questions along those lines comes up. 

Take this article by CNBC from November of last year:

*Being in the enviable position of having that much cash to spend seems unenviable at the moment, as far as Berkshire shareholders, and maybe even Buffett, are concerned. Buffett’s company is currently on pace for its worst annual stock performance since 2009.*

*“He pinned himself into a corner a few years ago, saying I can’t have $150 billion in cash in three to four years and say that’s alright,” said Greggory Warren, a Morningstar analyst who covers Berkshire Hathaway.*

*Underperformance versus the index, deals that have not worked out well, such as Kraft Heinz (thought it showed signs of life in its most recent earnings), and increasing willingness on Buffett’s part to consider share buybacks, all point to the the importance of moving that cash into investments that generate a return.""*

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/even-obvious-way-for-buffett-to-solve-big-cash-problem-is-a-puzzle.html

I can spend all day finding each and every article from the past 2-3 years but you understand my point. 

As stocks soared to all time highs, people wondered just as they did during the tech boom whether Buffett had lost his touch. Now Buffett is sitting on a 125+ Billion dollar mountain of cash just biding his time. He's poised more favorably than he could ever ask for, and prices are just getting more reasonable by the day.

TLDR: When you see Buffett stacking cash, he's not an idiot. He's waiting for prices to become reasonable again, which only happens after a significant market decline.

lih6ee,2021-02-12,2021-02-12 13:23:04,Full Diligence Post on Palantir (PLTR) - Earnings Next Monday (2/16) & Lockup Expiration (2/19),"Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Palantir ahead of its earnings next TUESDAY (Edit: sorry I got the day wrong in the title but the date 2/16 is correct). Lockup expiration is also 2/18*** (didn’t realize palantir was reporting before market open). Warning: long post ahead and TLDR at the bottom.

**Palantir Business Overview**

* In one sentence, Palantir creates **operating systems** that integrates vast amounts of data from an organization’s various data silos and allows users to build applications that drive better decision making
* If that's confusing, no worries. The way I like to think of Palantir's software is that if Batman purchased the software from a company today for his supercomputer which aggregates data from thousands of sources and allows him to make intelligent decisions, that software would be from Palantir
* The company has three main software platforms: **Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo**
* **Gotham (government side)**
   * Gotham is Palantir’s software offering primarily for defense and intelligence sectors, AKA governments
   * Gotham is an end-to-end operating system that collects data from hundreds to millions of different sources and combines them onto one platform so users can manage operations
   * Gotham is quickly becoming the de facto data solution across many US federal agencies and rumor has it that it was the software that helped track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011
* **Foundry (commercial side)**
   * Next up is Foundry, a platform that is geared towards the 6,000 businesses around the world with over $500 million in revenue
   * Similar to Gotham, Foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data
   * For example, one of Palantir’s customers is Skywise, an aviation platform that has become the central operating system for the airline industry
* **Apollo (underlying infrastructure)**
   * Apollo is the last piece of the Palantir puzzle, and you can think of it as the underlying infrastructure that Gotham and Foundry lie upon
   * Apollo is a relatively new platform that Palantir introduced in order to more efficiently update the software that runs Gotham and Foundry, increasing the number of upgrades Palantir can manage across installations from an average of 20,000 per week in Q2 2019 to more than 41,000 per week in Q2 2020
* The company has estimated its **total addressable market as $119 billion,** of which $63 billion is for the government side while $56 billion is for commercial side

**The Palantir Business Model**

* Known as **Forward Deployed Engineers or FDEs,** Palantir leverages their technical talent as support and sales as well and they are often sent to the front lines of the battlefield for Gotham or company for Foundry
   * I believe that this in particular is what helped Palantir create a competitive moat in the government sector
* While the FDEs are a differentiator, Palantir has also started to build out a **more traditional salesforce** in order to better target customers and explain the company’s value proposition but this salesforce currently only accounts for 3% of the company’s total headcount
* Using both FDEs and a traditional salesforce, Palantir’s business model employs a 3 step process: acquire, expand, and scale
* **Acquire**
   * In the acquire step, Palantir provides a potential customer with a short-term pilot program at Palantir’s expense and therefore operate at a loss
* **Expand**
   * In the expand phase, Palantir seeks to understand the customer’s key challenges and ensure that its software delivers results
* **Scale**
   * The scale phase is where Palantir thrives. At this point, the customer is essentially using Palantir’s software for its operations and Palantir can also upsell to the customer by continually offering new services with minimal extra cost
* To give you a sense of the numbers for each phase, In 2019, Palantir generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which **$0.6 million** came from customers in the **Acquire** phase, **$176.3 million** from the **Expand** phase, and **$565.7** million from the **Scale** phase

**The Bull Case**

* **Section 2377**
   * In 2016, Palantir sued the US Army in what’s known as Decision 2377
   * To go into the history a little bit, in 1994, the Federal Streamlining Acquisition Act (FASA) was passed, which required that the federal government consider and acquire readily available, proven commercial services like Palantir’s rather than custom-developed solutions built by the government which has a reputation for spending inefficiently
   * This rule was largely ignored until Palantir sued and won in court, and this was extremely important because it allowed Palantir to compete and win deals across all federal agencies, which greatly helps the company realize its total addressable market. Since then, Palantir's revenue from the US Army and US government has skyrocketed
* **Sticky, Best-in-Class Product**
   * Simply put, there is nothing that offers what Palantir is offering. Its technology is way beyond most of its competitors in terms of offering a premium operating system
   * Palantir’s Gotham and Foundry often take more than a year to get fully up and running and the more it’s used, the more data in the system and the more time that has been spent by customers training employees on how to use the system
   * Palantir’s platforms becomes incredibly expensive to switch out of not just in terms of money but also time, with customers saying replacing the system could take anywhere from 6 to 18 months
   * To further prove this point, Palantir’s top 20 customers have been with the company for an average of 7 years and as of October 2020, 93% of revenue was generated by existing customers
   * In addition to this, in the latest quarterly earnings, Palantir was selected out of 999 bids by the US Army for a 2-year $91 million contract to build AI and machine learning capabilities
* **Positive Secular Trends and Growing, Achievable TAM**
   * I think everyone at this point realizes that companies are going digital transformations and Palantir has spent $1.5 billion in the past 11 years creating innovative software that becomes increasingly powerful each day
   * The company is at the right place at the right time with a total addressable market expected to grow into the few hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 5 years
   * And with just about $1 billion dollars in revenue over the past 12 months, Palantir has less than 1% market share and has plenty of room for growth
   * But perhaps most importantly, Palantir is creating a much more efficient business model with an improving tech product that will help the company achieve its TAM
      * In the latest earnings call, management said that it plans to triple its salesforce headcount due to its recent success
      * And among other improvements, the Apollo platform has helped the company greatly reduce the costs and time required to get a customer up and running
   * Being able to better target customers and onboard them quickly while providing a best-in-class and sticky data platform points to a bright future for Palantir

**The Bear Case**

* **Double-Edged Business Model**
   * While Palantir’s differentiated services and business model is one of the company’s key strengths, there are also several downsides as well
   * First, due to the custom-built solutions Palantir offers, the company undergoes a costly and complicated minimum 6 month sales cycle that can often amount to nothing
   * Second, even if a customer jumps on board, contracts are cancelable with a typical notice of 3-6 months
   * Third, the deep history it has with customers results in a very top-heavy concentration
      * As of the third quarter of 2020, the top 20 customers represented 61% of the company’s revenue, which notably is down from 73% from the year prior
   * Lastly, the deal-by-deal nature of Palantir’s business model means that the sources of revenue are lumpy and hard to predict, which can be a cause of concern for investors
* **Biden Administration and Negative Headline Risk**
   * First, Peter Thiel was an outspoken supporter of Trump, who increased defense spending 5% a year while Obama decreased spending 3% a year.
      * While I don’t think this will be a long-term issue, a Biden presidency does represent a potential decrease in defense budgets which could hinder Palantir’s growth with Gotham
      * However, it is important to note that management during its latest earnings call did address this issue, stating that it has worked with many administrations across the world and doesn’t foresee this to be a problem
   * Second, Palantir has been targeted by the media several times for giving the government too much power and the political and social environment in which the tide seems to be turning against tech could present Palantir with headaches in the future
      * This risk is also further exacerbated by the fact that Palantir is 49.9999% owned by its co-founders, who are outspoken and strongly opinionated. Clear corporate governance risk.
* **Tough Competition in Commercial Space**
   * In my opinion the largest obstacle Palantir faces is its ability to execute in the commercial space
   * Palantir offers an expensive, premium, custom-built end-to-end solution for clients, which is great for the government but not exactly what most businesses are looking for
   * Instead, most large scale businesses have already invested heavily into their own systems and want to buy best-in-class piecemeal solutions from different tech companies
   * Several notable businesses left Palantir from 2019 to 2020, including JP Morgan, Coca Cola, and American Express, and this decreased the customer count from 133 to 125
   * However, one important thing to note is that in the latest earnings call, Palantir’s management openly addressed this issue and the company has already started to provide solutions that are modular, which means customers can take the individual solutions they want rather than adopting the entire Foundry system
      * This also allows the company to offer different price points which may allow Palantir to be more competitive in the market
      * Recent news of bringing on BP and IBM as clients could also be a sign that its Foundry business may be ready for mass adoption
* **Lock-up Expiration**
   * Because this is a short-term risk, I’m adding this as a bonus bearish reason
   * Palantir went public through a direct listing on September 30, 2020, during which up to 20% of shares were available to trade (edit, thx for pointing this out!) for employees and stakeholders, (NOT all available shares outstanding)
   * This remaining 80% (roughly 30-40% of shares outstanding) is available to trade starting February 18th when the lockup expires and this could lead to a flooding of shares being sold and at the very least, volatility caused by the uncertainty

**Financials and Valuation**

* **Starting off with the income statement,** the important things to note is that from 2018 to 2019, the company has grown revenue by about 25% while maintaining roughly the same amount in operating expenses, which speaks to the improved operational efficiency of the company
   * The company has guided to $1.07 billion for the full year of 2020, which represents a 44% year over year increase and for a company with 1 billion in revenue, increasing revenue growth is a great sign
   * Comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019, the company was able to increase average revenue per customer by 38% and grew commercial revenue by 35% and government revenue by 68%
   * With all this said, one piece of concern in Palantir’s income statement is its net losses. The company has not been able to turn a profit in its entire history, but it did report positive adjusted operating income in its latest quarter when adjusted for stock based compensation
* **Moving onto its latest cash flow statement,** what you mainly need to know is that the company has recently had a huge stock based compensation expense this past year due to the direct listing, so if you were to add that back, the company is essentially near break-even
   * However, the company’s free cash flow (operating cash flow minus your capital expenditures) is negative, so the company still is clearly losing money although much less than even a year prior
* **Lastly, Palantir has a great balance sheet**
   * With $1.8 billion in cash and only $200mm in debt, the company is in a great position to fuel its future growth
* **Regarding the company’s valuation,** while the company is growing nicely at 44% from 2019-2020, and is expected to grow 31% from 2020-2021 based on street estimates, it currently trades around a 45x NTM sales multiple depending on the day, which makes it one of the most expensive companies on the market
   * The key question here is do you want to pay an extremely high premium for a company that does have a best-in-class software or wait for a better entry point?

**What I’m Doing**

* Personally, I can't justify Palantir's valuation, which may sound a little old-school but I think there are better opportunities out there
* However, in the long-run I am bullish on the company and would buy on any major dips in the 20s (and teens if it somehow falls down to that)
* I'm also closely monitoring what happens after earnings (2/16) and next week the lock-up expires on 2/19 so it'll be interesting to see what happens to the stock then

**TLDR:** Palantir has a best-in-class, sticky data platform that it offers to both the government side (where it's pretty much a monopoly) and businesses (which is picking up steam with tweaks to the business model and a growing salesforce). Growing healthy top-line but unprofitable and trading at a higher valuation than almost all other software companies. I am holding off on buying for now but would welcome major dips as great buying opportunities.

qxjwg0,2021-11-19,2021-11-19 11:32:33,There's an extremely blatant astroturfing effort to promote mining-related stocks on this and other investment subreddits,"[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qxeym8/buying_copper_stocks_now_that_prices_are_taking_a/) post about copper miners just hit the top of this subreddit, and it's a good example of the obvious astroturfing effort that's going on.

Take a look at this account's [post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/KatheKnuth/submitted/) and you'll see a common pattern: a few karma-farming posts from a couple of months ago that invariably come in subreddits like /r/aww, /r/nextfuckinglevel, /r/MadeMeSmile, /r/funny, etc. Then nothing, then a submission to a stock subreddit. Anybody with experience moderating subreddits can pick this out as a bought account immediately. This is an extremely common pattern where people build up some easy karma on a clean account and then sell it for use in various promotional campaigns.

Take a look at the post content and you'll see a pattern that will repeat: one or two paragraphs of content-free 'analysis' about events in whatever mining sector, then a series of 'pitch' paragraphs where they link to a random junior miner and include the ticker. Presumably this is an attempt to pump/draw attention to these stocks.

I've been noticing this happening in /r/investing and /r/stocks over the past few months, here are a few examples that I picked up in just 15 minutes by searching for recent posts about 'mining', 'copper', 'gold', and other such keywords. On each of these posts note the exact same post framework and then click on the username -> 'posted' tab to see the exact same type of post history.

This is just quickly scanning over posts in these two subreddits over the past month - it's been going on longer than that and I'm guessing is probably in other investing-related subreddits as well that I just don't see.

Anyway, I don't have any personal opinion on the stocks or sectors in question, but I do feel it's good to point this out and to remind everybody that when you're reading stuff on Reddit you are not necessarily reading agenda-free or good faith discussions, you are being marketed to.

ngamt2,2021-05-19,2021-05-19 12:40:46,Can we please throw out the idea that Bitcoin is an asset that protects against inflation?,"Throughout the lifecycle of bitcoin, I've heard this statement over and over again. ""Bitcoin is gold for the 21st century""... ""Bitcoin is protection against jpow's printer"".... ""Bitcoin prevents against USD debasement""...

I have nothing against blockchain tech on its own. I think there are some wonderful aspects to the technology. With that said, the amount of narratives used to sell bitcoin to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid. And given today's selloff, it's a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality.

**Bitcoin As Inflation Protection = Bad Narrative**

I have said for a long time that bitcoin is a RISK ASSET. It's yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from the growth investing asset class.

If bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection, then why in the world did it tank 12% on the day that we got the highest YOY CPI print in over a decade? And nobody can argue that it was a product of interest rates rising... since they haven't risen in any significant way since that inflation print. And it's now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class. Something... doesn't add up here.

Why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something, when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that aren't dependent on misleading people on the economics of inflation and ""money printing""? And for whatever it's worth, Gold suffers from some of the same problems, although it obviously behaves a bit differently than crypto.

**Bad Economic Narratives Dominate Bitcoin Beliefs**

* How many times do people need to show you M2 charts before they actually take a minute and compare M2 to the actual inflation levels? Hint for those who aren't aware, growth in M2 is 100% meaningless if it causes an equivalent drop in the velocity of money.
* How many times do people need to call quantitative easing ""money printing"", without understanding how quantitative easing actually works? Hint: the ""money printing"" comes from temporary fiscal stimulus, not from the fed pushing reserves that are never used onto banks' balance sheets.
* How many times do people misunderstand that ""asset inflation"" (which is just another word for a bubble) is different than consumer price inflation? Hint: Real consumer price inflation is typically rather negative for more speculative risk assets (such as bitcoin).
* How many times do people need to suggest the US dollar is ""getting killed"" before they actually look at a price history chart of the US Dollar? Hint: the US dollar is more or less right in the middle of it's price range over the last 50+ years, is significantly higher than it was throughout the entire time period from 2005-2015, and hasn't even dropped that far this year despite the massive amount of stimulus + fed swap lines used since the Covid pandemic. You would think that if the US dollar was ***actually*** debasing, we would get more than a 5% drawdown during the largest stimulus package ever. 

&#x200B;

My personal subjective opinion is that Bitcoin is yet another risk asset that benefits largely from too much money chasing too few assets. This IS actually in part a product of quantitative easing, but the irony here is that QE is not actually causing inflation. I think blockchain will likely be used in the future for a wide variety of uses, but I have no clue whether Bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership. Note: I do not own any crypto or crypto-oriented stocks, so I don't have anything to either gain or lose here.

And by the way, this is not intended as a bullish or bearish post on bitcoin.

A week later SBF admitted that FTX was insolvent and begged CZ to bail them out. CZ said Binance would absorb FTX's holdings. Then CZ got a look at the books and changed his mind, letting FTX and SBF to twist in the wind. FTT was trading in the 30 dollar range last month, now its worth $3 but you would be insane to buy it.

I wanted to chat a bit about options here. I realize that there are already plenty of articles about options that you can find online, but many are either overly complex, oversimplified, trying to sell you some products, etc. I figured I would explain some of it here, in order to reduce the learning barrier. After all, knowledge is power. And given the **recent** [event](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/young-robinhood-trader-kills-himself-over-730000-loss) **with Robinhood**, I figured it is worth repeating how options work so you understand what is happening under the hood, and don’t end up taking too many risks and making mistakes that you could regret later. If you are interested in trading options, I invite you to look for more details online.

I have been trading options since 2008. I made some mistakes, so many, especially in the beginning. Over the years, I kinda reduced my option trading activities, but these past few months, I have been doing it much more as there are so many opportunities and the market is so volatile, which helps with my trading style.

This **first** post is to explain how options work in general, the [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hdg9xc/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_2_of_4/) post will go into some more details, the third posts [3a](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgomwv/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3a_of_4/) and [3b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgp05y/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3b_of_4/) will explain some standard strategies, and the fourth posts ([4a](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hlb9ns/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_4a_of_4/) and [4b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hu8uh9/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_last_post_part/)) will give some examples for my recent trades with gains and losses and how I approach option investing. If you are looking at r/wsb style of investment, please skip these posts, they are not for you. I am a relatively conservative investor and will avoid pure gambles, but I will still take some calculated risks. So I say. :) It is fair to say that most of my money is invested in standard ETFs / mutual funds / Real Estate. So, my option play represents only a percentage of my overall wealth.

It is often perceived that options are extremely risky, and one of the best ways to get ruined. For some trades, this can be true. To dispel a myth, in reality, options can also be used to be extremely conservative. Even to a point where you barely make any money at all in any market. Unlike for shares, where you can only control the diversification, with options you have a much bigger control on the risk / profit profile. Time and volatility is also a factor that you can profit (or lose) from.

One thing to note is that not all companies or ETFs provide options for their shares.

**The basics: CALL and PUT contracts, strike, and exercise**

Options are split into two groups: CALLs and PUTs. Both have a strike, an expiration date, and a number of shares attached to it. We’ll talk about the exercise and expiration date a bit later. When you buy a call or put option, you buy a contract with a 3rd party through your broker and the stock market. Usually, one contract represents 100 shares.

The strike corresponds to a share price for the underlying instrument. So for SPY that is worth $308 today, you will have options with strike $308, but also $300, $301, $310, etc… From $5 to $525. Options strikes are created as the underlying instrument SPY goes up and down. For SPY, strikes have a granularity of $1 around the share price, but can also be $5 or even $10 farther from the current price. Some other instruments have a $2.5, $5 or even $10 granularity. It can even have a $0.50 granularity. (Hello Hertz! It dropped so much that the lowest strike is $0.50 right now).

A CALL is a contract that allows the buyer to buy a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date. If you buy a call with a $150 strike, and the share price went up to reach $200, this allows you to buy some shares at $150 that are now worth $200. The action of exchanging your call against some shares that you bought at the strike price is called exercising the call. When you exercise your call contract, you are buying shares into your account.

Remember that, in most cases, 1 contract will buy 100 shares in your account. When exercising each call contract, you will need $15k of cash in your account in this example ($150 for the strike, multiplied by 100 shares). And the same 100 shares are now worth $20k (at $200 for each share). Not accounting for the price you paid for the call option (more on this later), this means you will make a profit of $5k if you sell the shares.

Conversely, a PUT is a contract that allows the buyer to sell a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date. If you bought a put with a $200 strike, and the share price went down to $150, this allows you to sell some shares at $200 that are now worth $150 each. Similarly to a call, the action of exchanging your put against some shares that you sold is called exercising the put.

When exercising each put contract, you are selling 100 shares from your account. When exercising each contract, your 100 shares will be sold for $20k ($200 for the strike multiplied by 100 shares). And the same 100 shares are now worth $15k (at $150 for each share). Not accounting for the price you paid for the put option, this means you made a profit of $5k. If you did not have the 100 shares per contract in your account, you would be actually short selling the shares, and you could make the $5k profit by buying these shares back.

In summary, a call buys shares when exercising. A put sells shares when exercising. Most importantly, in the vast majority of the cases, you should actually not exercise your contracts, but instead, you should sell your call or put at the market price, as you will increase your profit (see extrinsic value later).

Brokers do not allow you to exercise the contract if the difference between the strike and the current value is going to make you lose money. In other words, you can’t exercise when the current value is below the strike for a call (you want to buy low when the value is high), or current value is above the strike for a put (you want to sell high when the value is low).

Most brokers do auto-exercise your call and put contracts at the expiration date if they can be exercised. If the contracts cannot be exercised at the expiration date, and you did not sell your contracts before, they will be worthless, and the money you spent buying the contracts will be completely lost.

Although I am mostly talking about American style options that can be exercised at any time, there are also European style options that can only be exercised at expiration. In the US markets, pretty much all stocks and ETFs are American style, But the cash-settled indexes, like SPX and RUT, are European style.

**The basics: Intrinsic and extrinsic value**

A call or a put contract costs money to buy, called a premium, so a 3rd party can give you the right to exercise the call or the put. After all, they won’t take the other side of this contract for free, and they have to be remunerated. The minimum for a contract is $0.01 per share for some very liquid ETFs, but for most instruments, it is $0.05, thus $5 per contract for 100 shares. When you buy a call or put, this premium is the most you can lose by expiration date. The 3rd party that sold the contract to you is open to many more risks and potential losses (see below).

The value of the call and put contracts will depend on the strike, on the share price going up and down, the share’s volatility (how fast / far it goes up or down), and the time passing.

When you buy a contract, the strike and the expiration date is known. However, the share price and volatility will constantly change. All the call and put options are constantly repriced as time is also passing (closer to the expiration date).

The intrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that only depends on the strike and the current share price. It is above $0 only when you can exercise the contract. The extrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that depends on the volatility and time. For pretty much all options, this extrinsic value is above $0, and will slowly drop to $0 as we get closer to the expiration.

Let’s take an example with a share price of $150.

Say, you buy a call with a strike of $145 expiring in a month for $7. The intrinsic value is $5 ($150 - $145), the extrinsic value is $2 ($7 - $5). Said differently, if the share price did not move at all until the expiration date, your call contract would bring you $5 per share. You would have lost $2 due to the time passing.

Similarly, you buy a put with a strike of $155 expiring in a month for $7. The intrinsic value is $5 ($155 - $150), the extrinsic value is $2 ($7 - $5).

It is worth noting that any call with a strike price at $150 or above has $0 of intrinsic value. If you pay $4 for a $155 call, all the $4 is extrinsic value. If the stock price does not go over $155, you will lose the full $4 per share (so a $400 loss per contract). Similarly, a put with a strike price at $150 or below has $0 of intrinsic value. If you pay $4 for a $145 call, all the $4 is extrinsic value. Your contract will be worthless by expiration if the stock price did not drop under $145.

Note that, in these examples, I use the same price for the call and put options that are $5 away from the strike price, but it’s not always the case. The call and price options are priced differently depending on the volatility, market expectations, potential dividends, cost of money, etc.

**The basics: ATM, ITM, and OTM**

There are few definitions related to the relationship between the strike and the current share value for puts and calls.

An option is ‘At The Money’ (ATM) when the current share value is matching the strike. The share price is $150, and the strike of $150 for both the call and put contracts will be considered ‘at the money’.

An option is ‘In The Money’ (ITM) when the contract has some intrinsic value. The share price is $150, so a call at $140 is ‘in the money’, with $10 of intrinsic value. A put at $160 is ‘in the money’, with $10 of intrinsic value too.

An option is ‘deep in the money’ when the option is ITM and the strike is far from the current share price (for example more than 20%). For example, with a share price of $150, a $100 call will be considered ‘deep in the money’. Same for a $200 put.

Conversely, an option is ‘out of the money’ if there is no intrinsic value. With a $150 share price, a $160 call is ‘out of the money’. A $140 put is ‘out of the money’. The money you paid for the call and put is purely extrinsic value, there is no intrinsic value. An option is ‘deep out of the money’ when the option is OTM and the strike is far from the current share price. For example, with a share price of $150, a $200 call will be considered ‘deep out of the money’. Same for a $100 put.

As the share price goes up and down, depending on the option strikes, it can switch between ITM, to ATM, to OTM. The option price will always reflect that and will be based on the time at expiration and the current share volatility.

Few key things to note:

* The deeper ITM an option is, the more expensive it is. As it gets deeper ITM, the intrinsic value increases, the extrinsic value decreases. You have a higher chance for the option to be worth something, and you will lose less money on the extrinsic value. The price of Deep ITM options will move very closely to the underlying shares (a positive correlation for calls, a negative correlation for puts).
* The deeper OTM an option is, the less expensive it is. Again, OTM option price is pure extrinsic value. You have a very small chance for the option to be worth something by expiration.
* The maximum extrinsic value is when the option is ATM. It is purely extrinsic value, with barely any intrinsic value. These option strikes are the most sensitive to time, volatility and share price.

Here is an example, with the same share price of $150. For a call, you could get something like this:

Strike = $100 / Premium = $53 / Intrinsic = $50 / Extrinsic = $3 ← Deep ITM

Strike = $125 / Premium = $30 / Intrinsic = $25 / Extrinsic = $5 ← ITM

Strike = $150 / Premium = $9   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $9 ← ATM

Strike = $175 / Premium = $5   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $5 ← OTM

Strike = $200 / Premium = $3   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $3 ← Deep OTM

You can imagine the same table for a put but in the other direction.

It is worth noting that if you have a $100 call and you decide to exercise it, you would directly get $50 of proceeds per share, but you would also destroy the extrinsic value to $0, losing $3 of proceeds. Instead of exercising your call, you are much better off selling your call for $53. In general, there are not many reasons to exercise your options. Selling them is more advantageous.

ucp8pg,2022-04-26,2022-04-26 19:02:50,Robinhood Lays Off 9% Of Full-Time Employees After Decline In Users,"[https://blog.robinhood.com/](https://blog.robinhood.com/)

*Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev shared the below to Robinhood employees following a company-wide meeting to discuss the changes.*

Today we made the difficult announcement that we are letting go approximately 9% of our full-time employees. While this decision was necessary, it was not one we undertook lightly, and I’d like to share our rationale. 

As you know, throughout 2020 and H1 2021, we went through a period of hyper growth accelerated by several factors including pandemic lockdowns, low interest rates, and fiscal stimulus. We grew net funded accounts from 5M to 22M and revenue from \~$278M in 2019 to over $1.8B in 2021.

This rapid headcount growth has led to some duplicate roles and job functions, and more layers and complexity than are optimal.

lbnqg1,2021-02-03,2021-02-03 08:41:17,$CRSR Corsair DD - The Q4 results are basically already out and nobody is talking about it!,"*“While the whole world was having a big old party, a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could. \[…\] These outsiders saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy, and they saw it by doing something the rest of the suckers never thought to do: They looked”.* (Big Short)

I have seen many good quality DD about Corsair. We all know it’s a great business. 

What I want to focus on is the financials. More specifically: **We already know Q4 results and nobody is talking about it! Why? Because nobody looked!!!**

Corsair recently posted a prospectus related to the sale of 7.5M shares by some insiders (totally normal as it’s mostly the private equity owner – EagleTree - selling a small bit and passing from 78.32% to 68.55% ownership - they sold 7,135,000 out of the 7,500,000 sold… It’s totally fair for the PE owner to cash out a bit). 

Here’s the **prospectus (dated 21st of January 2021**): [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33) 

**1)** Now, check out page 9 of the document 

  **For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:** 

**• Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million** 

**• Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million**

**• Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million**   
 

Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates…

In fact, the company initially estimated the following (*from Q3 release* [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

For the full year 2020, we currently expect: 

• Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.

• Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million. 

• Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.  

Then, they updated the *guidance on November 30th 2020* ([https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook)): 

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

* Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.
* Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.
* Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.  
 

**So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!**

&#x200B;

**2)** But that’s not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again… we just need to look). 

As they mention on the Q3 report, “as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million”.

In the more recent prospectus (page 10): 

*In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.*   
 

**This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.** As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So **this implies around 150M FCF in 2020** (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M). 

(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

   
At $39, Corsair has a 3.5Bn market cap (91.92M of shares outstanding).

This is a very respectable cash flow yield of 4.2%. I’d be expecting a much lower yield from a company growing as fast as Corsair is (60.7% growth year-over-year in Q3 and, assuming sales of 554M for Q4 vs 327M for Q4 2019, a growth of 69.4% in Q4).

\-----

Now, you must be thinking: but the smart money already knows this! They have accounted for it!

I used to be like you… I used to think the market was efficient and that big funds and banks were always looking carefully at things! 

No f\*\*\* way!!!

Take a look at Goldman Sachs’ research from February 1st 2021 (yes, after the prospectus was published). 

Someone shared it on reddit

[https://preview.redd.it/nrmzjy9lw3f61.png?width=4129&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c3bf8e1c1308a15dbbb26b519c58a4d7dea8ab0](https://preview.redd.it/nrmzjy9lw3f61.png?width=4129&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c3bf8e1c1308a15dbbb26b519c58a4d7dea8ab0)

   
They still base themselves on the updated guidance of November 30th 2020. No mention whatsoever of the much more recently updated “guidance” (more than a guidance, it’s actually the results given how close the ranges are…)

&#x200B;

m4ojn2,2021-03-14,2021-03-14 00:09:58,"PSA: If You recently left Robinhood, double check your transferred cost-basis!","If you, like me, used recent events as an excuse to leave the clowncar Robinhood, double-check that the cost basis for the transferred shares is correct. Robinhood apparently managed to send Vanguard random numbers for my portfolio.

Even on really simple cases of a few shares bought a year ago and never traded at any point later, the cost basis is just... wrong? For my entire portfolio, plus a few dollars/share here, minus a few dollars/share there, not really any reasoning for any of it, but definitely an overall much lower total cost basis than actually should have been there.

If you haven’t left Robinhood yet, get out. This kind of technical incompetence isn’t just embarrassing, it’s scary. You don’t want to keep your money in a clown car.

Edit: For those saying they never received cost basis, note that I only received mine more than a full month later and after I sold some shares - the transfers went through on 2/5-2/8 and I got a statement indicating cost basis was updated on 3/10 for shares which I'd sold (and cost basis information appeared on all other shares). Somehow the date in the cost basis is correct on Vanguard, but the amounts are wonky (roughly the date of the transfer, but the purchase date is correct for some, for others random values). For example, 4 shares of EA came through as 141.50, but my entire history with RH only has one purchase for 147.25 - https://imgur.com/a/GwvQRSH",3173,671,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m4ojn2/psa_if_you_recently_left_robinhood_double_check/,all,Unknown,0.97

This weekend I went and bought some Plywood for the house. I couldn’t believe how much I had to pay for some simple 2’x4’s.

The price has gone up by 250% in just the last few months. With the housing boom happening and everyone trying to remodel their house I see this continuing on for a while.

Is anyone else noticing this and trying to take advantage of it?


The two lumber stocks I found are Weyerhaeuser(WY) and Rayonier (RYN) both of the stocks are up slightly but don’t seem outrageous in terms of evaluations.

You can see WY doesn’t have a crazy evaluation. It also peaked in 2007 during the last housing boom.

> Elon Musk tweeted a complaint about Tesla’s share price that wiped $14bn off the company’s stock market value on Friday morning.

	Tesla did not immediately confirm whether Mr Musk’s tweet had been given legal clearance, and did not respond to a question about whether the company currently has a general counsel. Tesla lost three general counsels last year, one of them quitting after only two months.


	The Tesla boss, who has 33m followers on Twitter, issued his curt verdict on his company’s shares early in the morning in California on Friday, writing: “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”

Within moments the Tesla share price started sinking, dropping 10 per cent over the course of an hour before recovering slightly. The sharp move comes in what has been a hugely volatile period for Tesla’s shares. They slumped more than 60 per cent after coronavirus hit, but then rebounded by 120 per cent.

kpeffw,2021-01-03,2021-01-03 00:19:22,Reasons We May Not Be in a Bubble,"I'm seeing a lot of posts comparing this to the 2000 dot-com bubble. Here's a breakdown of why we're likely not anywhere close to 2000 levels of craziness.

**First:**  During the dot-com era, the Nasdaq Composite's price-to-earnings valuation ran up as high as 200. By comparison, the index's P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. 

**Second:** Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.

**Third:** Much of the value gains we're seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html)

**Fourth:** The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren't backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.

**Fifth:** The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we're printing against our 22T dollar economy when we're really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.

This is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:

[https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/](https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/)

**My Take:** There are a few stocks that are out of control with their valuations (Hi TSLA!), and a few sectors that are overvalued, but overall the market looks to be on sturdy ground with the increased savings, and the increased liquidity. There will be peaks and valleys, but I think there's a lot of room to grow, especially once the vaccine is widespread.",3033,882,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpeffw/reasons_we_may_not_be_in_a_bubble/,all,Unknown,0.96

“It’s a game. If it weren’t securities, let’s say it was monopoly, let’s say it’s Draft Kings ... it would be so much fun,” Cramer said on “Squawk Box.” “Pick a couple of stocks, you gun them in the morning, and then you hope people are stupid enough and they buy them.”

If Elon had faith that his stock still had room to grow, there is no chance in hell he'd be selling. He'd just be getting a loan to cover his tax liabilities, while his equity value increases. The fact that he's trying to cash out shows he thinks it's near peak and about to go down. All the media drama is just an attempt to retain value for as long as possible to distract and justify his cash out. 

It's crazy how I see NO ONE talking about this... And instead it's all about ""clever redditors"" seeing his real intentions are to cover his tax liability. No it's not.

ix957m,2020-09-21,2020-09-21 16:55:09,Nikola founder Trevor Milton forfeits $166 million in stock he would have lost any way and gets to keep $3.1 billion under separation deal,"Nikola founder Trevor Milton agreed to forfeit up to roughly $166 million of equity as well as a two-year, $20 million consulting contract as part of his abrupt departure from the company he started. However, the EV executive gets to walk away with more than $3.1 billion in stock as part of a separation agreement reached over the weekend.

Milton, who’s come under scrutiny in recent days, agreed to give up his position and duties as executive chairman of the board as well as all other board seats on the company’s subsidiaries, according to the agreement dated Sunday. The deal strips the 39-year old entrepreneur of any say in the company’s operations and blocks him from attempting to influence any decisions for at least three years, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. Milton agreed to advise the company as an unpaid consultant on an ad hoc basis through the end of the year, but he cannot comment about the company on social media, blogs or other online platforms without legal approval from Nikola, according to the deal.

The value of his exit package will vary over time as the start-up’s shares have swung wildly since it went public on June 4. The agreement requires Milton to give up roughly 4.9 million in restricted, performance-based shares valued at $166 million as of Friday’s closing price of $34.19 a share while allowing him to walk away with more than 91.6 million shares that were worth over $3.1 billion.

Nikola declined to comment on Milton’s exit package.

‘Continued service’

The company also accelerated vesting on 600,000 restricted shares worth more than $20 million, allowing Milton to sell stock that was previously locked up until June 3, 2023 sometime within then next six months. Milton really didn’t give up much since the restricted shares he forfeited were contingent on the stock’s performance and his “continued service” at the company through that same date, so he would have lost that equity regardless, according to a separate securities filing.

Milton’s resignation sent shares of the company plummeting in premarket trading before opening at $24.97 – their lowest opening price since the company went public. Shares were trading down about 20% during trading midday Monday.

&#x200B;

For investors worried about how the election will impact their portfolios over the long haul, fear not: Elections have seldom had a lasting impact on equity prices.

President Donald Trump has warned that the stock market will crash if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the [presidential election](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/election-2020-live-results-updates-trump-biden.html). Some market experts have also raised concern about the potential for a “blue wave” if Democrats gain a majority in the Senate, win the White House and keep control of the House.

However, history shows that stocks usually do well regardless of which party controls the White House or Congress. 

“I think people overestimate the importance of politics for investing,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 

### Are Republicans or Democrats better for stocks? 

Data over the past 78 years shows that party control over either chamber has relatively little to do with long-term changes in the broad S&P 500 stock index.

Starting in 1942, the numbers indicate that Republican and Democratic majorities in the House and Senate have had little impact on stock prices in the two years following an election. 

The same holds true when you look at the number of party seats gained or lost in the House and Senate, against stock prices in the S&P 500 during that period. 

The data yields similar results for the November to November cycle, which is a gauge of market sentiment to the election, as well as January to January, which shows the actual market performance of the Congress. 

### Presidents and stocks 

Where you start to see more of an impact is the combination of party control in both chambers of Congress. 

Data compiled by LPL Financial shows that beginning in 1950, the average annual stock return was 17.2% under a split Congress, 13.4% when Republicans held both chambers, and 10.7% when Democrats had control.

LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick said in a note that “markets tend to like checks and balances to make sure one party doesn’t have too much sway,” hence the stronger stock performance during a split Congress.

But when you broaden it out even further to consider the party of the president in tandem with party control of the two chambers, the trend of a split Congress being best for stocks doesn’t always hold true. 

Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, looked at how the market has performed under six political scenarios: a White House and Congress all under the same party, a White House with a split Congress, and a White House and Congress hailing from two different parties. Stovall included election data going back to 1945.

Of all the possible combinations, stocks appear to perform best when a Democrat is in the White House and the Congress is split. The second highest returns happen when a Democrat is president and Republicans control the Congress.

 

But ultimately, Stovall said, investors should be wary of reading too much into these numbers. 

“It’s a good example of how you can have data tell whatever story you want,” he said. “If you want to favor the Democrats, talk about the presidency. If you want to favor the Republicans, talk about House control.“  


Bob French, director of investment analysis at McLean Asset Management, agrees. “We can go in and slice and dice the data however we want and most of the time come up with whatever answer we want.”

However the vote plays out Tuesday, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee thinks the stock market is poised to take off.

“At least 90% of \[our\] portfolio strategy would be identical under either win,” Lee said in a note on Oct. 6. In either case, Lee predicts the outcome of the election will be bullish for stocks.",2866,213,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jnexf3/stop_stressing_about_which_party_is_better_for/,all,Unknown,0.93

>But in an email to employees Musk acknowledged that Tesla's actual profit margin is fairly low, only about 1%, and that the stock price is due to investor expectations of future profits rather than recent results.
>""If, at any point, they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a soufflé under a sledgehammer!"" he wrote in the email, which was first reported by Electrek. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the email.

""The order finds that, from at least 2008 through 2016, JPM, through numerous traders on its precious metals and Treasuries trading desks, including the heads of both desks, placed hundreds of thousands of orders to buy or sell certain gold, silver, platinum, palladium, Treasury note, and Treasury bond futures contracts with the intent to cancel those orders prior to execution. Through these spoof orders, the traders intentionally sent false signals of supply or demand designed to deceive market participants into executing against other orders they wanted filled. According to the order, in many instances, JPM traders acted with the intent to manipulate market prices and ultimately did cause artificial prices.""

Morgan Stanley is the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by Morgan Stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank’s internal communications. Bitcoin’s rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.

But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with “an aggressive risk tolerance” who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.

Two of the funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital, a crypto firm founded by Mike Novogratz, while the third is a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and bitcoin company NYDIG.",2852,614,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m77ggf/morgan_stanley_becomes_the_first_big_us_bank_to/,all,Unknown,0.97

1jpgecv,2025-04-02,2025-04-02 00:33:57,"US tourism officials sound alarm, tourist flights to US sink 70% and could impact up to 140k hospitality jobs and $14B in economic spending","Here is my way of trying to find alpha in an erratic stock market - how I'm trading the US tourism dip.

**1. Canada is the US's largest source of tourism**: In 2024, 20 million Canadian tourists visited the US, spent $20.5 billion, and supported 140,000 US jobs. Canada's population is 40 million, so 50% of the entire country visited, and the US had 77 million tourists so 1 country is contributing 26% of visits.

**2. Recent US policies is leading to a tourism boycott from Canadians, and the rest of the world**: Tourists are boycotting US tourism due to tariffs, annexation threats, new travel barriers, and stories of visitors being unlawfully detained with no due process (in March a Canadian citizen was denied entry due to an expired visa, while this was a worker and not a tourist, instead of being allowed to return to Canada, as is the norm, she was shackled in chains and sent to a private ICE facility for 2 weeks without being able to contact a lawyer or get a bed).

**3. Analysts previously predicted policies would decrease tourism by 5%, new numbers released this week show that it's 14x higher:** For Canada alone (26% of US's entire tourism industry with 20 million visitors) - airline travel is **down** **70%**, land travel is **down** **45%**, and **85%+** of tourists survey say they cancelled their US trips.

**4. Here's how I'm planning on using this information to make stock trades into specific companies both long and short:** I'm shorting airlines that have high exposure to Can-US routes (it's been reported that airlines are slashing these routes due to 0 demand, and they is no clear way they can cover this revenue gap with a lower utilized fleet). I'm shorting select hospitality chains (hotels, restaurants) with high exposure/retail foot print in US states that border Canada like Niagara Falls. The US travel association says that even just a 10% dip in tourists will lead to $2 billion in economic losses and 140,000 jobs at risk (assuming 70% decrease from air travel happens across the board, that's $14b), I expect hospitality to have lower revenues. I'm shorting all non-essential or higher price retailers with a big footprint in hostility states, all these workers being laid off by lack of tourism + the fed job cuts won't have as much to spend (not my specific trade, but an example would be short Target, long Dollar General).

I'm long, and buying, non-American/Europe hotel chains and travel booking platforms that get most of their revenue outside the US, as I expect Canadian and international tourists to concentrate their spend to Europe/Asia/Oceania travel this summer.

**Edit 5. How do the European/International figures play?**

It's important to note that the Canadian tourism numbers dipped after the policies that happened in point 2. And we're seeing what those numbers are a few months later now. The US admin is rolling out these policies across the board tomorrow during ""Liberation Day"". The point here is that we won't see the true vector of an internal tourism boycott both in terms of magnitude and direction until the policies that were enacted on Canada are enacted globally, and consumers have time to adjust behaviour. But if the Canadian consumer is any indication, I have more conviction in my trades. **A glimpse into this being a trend is a French travel company reporting to Bloomberg their Europe to US travel bookings are down 25%.**

**Edit 6. Example of the airline play**

Yes I know US airlines are already down a lot. Rode that wave and exited my shorts. Now I'm shorting Air Canada and ONEX (parent company of WestJet), since they have much more exposure to US-Can routes, and are cutting routes dramatically with no increase in capacity elsewhere

Also looking to short airline maitence companies, the food suppliers specific to flight food, and fuel refineries/storage those two airlines use, and retail stores with large exposure to airports that only see US/Canada travel.

But going long on regional air craft hangers since their smaller fleets are used the most for US/Canada travel, while their bigger fleets will still be active for the europe/asia flight routes that havn't seen impact on demand.

Would like to hear what everyone thinks about this trade play. Thanks!

nfhan1,2021-05-18,2021-05-18 13:52:08,Why do passive investors frequently say “past performance does not guarantee future results” but they also say to invest in index funds and use past statistics to predict a future return rate of 10%?,"Passive investors say not to pick an outperforming mutual fund or ETF because you don’t know that it will outperform in the future. However, they look at market returns from the past to predict or expect returns in the future. Just because businesses have grown at a rate of 10% annually since 1926, why should investors expect 10% in the future?

It seems illogical to have your retirement rely on a system that is based on past performance from only the past 95 years. If a 20 year old starts investing today until retirement at 65, that’s 45 years. 45 years is 47% of the S&P 500’s existence, yet people say there’s enough evidence to expect a certain future return. If we had 1,000 years of historical data showing that the S&P returns 10% annually, I think that it would be ok to say that 10% can be expected for a 45 year window of retirement investing.

Saying that 10% returns can be expected in the future because thats what’s happened over the past 95 years is just using past performance to project future results. The passive investor frequently says that it does not make sense to expect certain future results because of past results.",2804,545,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nfhan1/why_do_passive_investors_frequently_say_past/,all,Unknown,0.92

Millions of people are behind on their credit-card and auto-loan payments, the latest sign of the coronavirus pandemic’s financial devastation.

Lenders in April had nearly 15 million credit cards in “financial hardship” programs, such as deferral programs that let borrowers temporarily stop making payments, according to estimates by credit-reporting firm TransUnion. That accounts for about 3% of the credit-card accounts the company tracks, TransUnion said Wednesday.

Nearly three million auto loans were in these hardship programs, accounting for about 3.5% of those tracked.

The numbers have surged from a year ago, when 0.03% of credit cards and about 0.5% of auto loans were in financial-hardship programs.

The spike in unemployment caused by the coronavirus has strained people’s ability to make their monthly debt payments. To make matters worse, Americans were tapping credit cards and auto loans at record levels even before the pandemic to deal with rising costs and stagnant incomes.

As coronavirus cases surged in the U.S. and businesses shut down, millions of people told their lenders they wouldn’t be able to pay their bills. Some lenders have allowed borrowers to miss payments for as long as several months on credit cards, auto loans and personal loans.

The performance award consists of a 10-year grant of stock options  that vests in 12 tranches. Each of the 12 tranches vests only if a pair  of milestones are both met.

* Market Cap Milestones: To meet the first market cap milestone, Tesla's current market cap must increase to $100 billion. For each of the remaining 11 milestones, Tesla's market cap must continue to increase in additional $50 billion increments. Thus, for Elon to fully vest in the award, Tesla's market cap must increase to $650 billion.
* Operational Milestones: To meet the operational milestones, Tesla  must meet a set of escalating Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets (the  only adjustment to EBITDA is for stock-based compensation). These  milestones are even more directly aligned with shareholder value  creation than those used in Elon's 2012 performance award. They are  designed to ensure that as Tesla's market cap grows, the company is also  executing well on both a top-line and bottom-line basis.

For each of the 12 tranches that is achieved, Elon will vest in  stock options that correspond to 1% of Tesla's current total outstanding  shares (1% of that amount is approximately 1.69 million shares). If  none of the 12 tranches is achieved, Elon will not receive any  compensation.

To give some perspective:

* 50 years old

* Graduated from a no-name college with a business degree (paid my own way, had about $20,000 in student loans when I graduated)

* First year out of college made $21,000.  Was at $58,000 when I was 29.  Highest year was about $125,000, but have averaged around $100,000 for the past 10 years.

* Pretty much all from putting as much as I could manage, or was permitted, into 401K and IRAs.  About 65% of the total is traditional retirement, 30% ROTH, and 5% non-retirement.

* I bought cheap used cars when I was under 25.  But then bought a new car and drove it for 20 years.

* The only ""bonus"" along the way was I had a job that I got 6 months severance (around $35,000) and got another job right away, so I had ""double income"" for that 6 months.

* 100% self-managed, primarily through an E*Trade account.

* I pretty much buy and just let it sit.  Last time I sold anything was about 3 years ago when I last rebalanced.  I held all through the 2009 recession and lost about 60%.  I've always invested pretty aggressively, so I got hit hard when it went down, but I've recovered well as it's gone up.

* I pretty much focus on mutual funds now after getting my ass handed to me on individual stocks a few times.  The few I have left are ""sentimental"".  The SIRI and MSFT I've owned since 2001.  The FB I bought in the IPO.  BABA was bought shortly after the IPO.

* I opened my first brokerage account with $2,000 in Ameritrade in 1997 thinking I was going to jump on the internet bubble.  I bought and sold weekly and rode that baby down.  I basically never made any money, and when the whole thing crashed, my $2,000 literally got down to like $37.  So many internet stocks that just evaporated.

fauzs4,2020-02-28,2020-02-28 08:51:30,My Coronavirus Stock Portfolio strategy,"Thought I would add something for a change, take this FWIW. Here is my strategy: 

1 - DCA
I am buying this week. I will be buying next week and the week after. Catch a falling knife, wait for the bottom, blahs blahs blahs. I am buying. I am mostly in index funds, although I have positions in several large companies also. I have been around a while, possibly longer than many people here. I was also buying in 2008 when people were freaking out and I have done quite well

2 - Unsubscribe from this sub
Seriously. This place has become a fear mongering echo chamber lately. Last week people were asking if they should buy at all time highs. Now people are shitting themselves because everything is on sale. I am going to Unsubscribe and try to focus more on my side hustles to generate more cash for buying (see item #1). I am not saying this to be a dick. I am saying it because it is legit unhealthy to freak out and surround yourself with other people that are freaking out.

Take a deep breath. New flu strains surface from time to time, it is very cyclical. Yes, things will get a little worse, but it will rebound and people who buy will be the beneficiaries (don't buy with your rent money obviously,  just be smart). Watch what happens when a vaccine is announced.

Just my two cents. I am going to Unsubscribe now and go for a run. Because good mental & physical health is key.

> Spotify launched in South Korea on February 1, 2021, but did so without music from artists with licensing deals under Kakao M, including IU, Zico and more.

> Now, releases distributed by the Korean label have been removed from Spotify around the world. Kakao M distributes a large share of Korean popular music, with 37.5 percent of the songs featured on the 2020 Top 400 Yearly Song Chart from Gaon Music Chart under the company.

[Also on BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-56237626).

Kakao M claiming it was Spotify removing it:

https://www.soompi.com/article/1456887wpp/kakao-m-releases-statement-explaining-that-spotify-was-the-one-to-end-their-licensing-agreement

> [...] later that same morning, Kakao M countered with its own statement, in which it claimed that Spotify had been the one who chose not to renew their agreement, even after a request on Kakao M’s part.

While this is clearly over compensation, Spotify needs to rectify this asap. From their [own news release](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-02-24/from-bts-to-blackpink-the-power-of-k-pop-has-no-bounds/), K-pop is a huge part of why people use their service:

> Between January 2014 and January 2020, K-pop's share of listening on Spotify increased by more than 1,800%.

> Since Spotify released its first K-Pop flagship playlist, K-Pop Daebak, in 2014 (and then a massive hub dedicated to the genre in 2015), there have been more than 41 billion K-Pop streams on Spotify. From rising artists to international collaborations, there’s something for both new and old K-Pop lovers on the platform.

> Top-streamed K-Pop artists on Spotify include BTS, BLACKPINK, EXO, TWICE, and Red Velvet. In 2019, BTS was the first group from Asia to surpass 5 billion streams on Spotify. And, as of February 2020, the boy band reached a new milestone: more than 8 billion streams (8 billion streams!) on the platform.

g7cza6,2020-04-24,2020-04-24 13:49:53,I lost 25% of my savings this week. Here is what I learned.,"After a long time of very responsibly trading blue chip stocks for modest gains single digit gains, last week I started contriving a plan to get into oil and ""hit it big"".

I spent at least 40 hours considering all my possible options. Then on Monday afternoon, it became clear to me - **it was time to strike**. I put 50% of my money in.

Tuesday morning was not fun.

Here's what I learned:

* **Don’t ever buy something you don’t FULLY understand.** On Monday, I bought into USO as oil prices bottomed, thinking I was buying into a fund that was purchasing up all of the May Futures contracts. I thought USO was rolling out of April and into May, and they were conveniently buying up all the world’s WTI at bottom of the barrel pricing. I saw the warnings all over the place that people didn’t understand that USO was based on futures, not spot prices. I KNEW USO was buying futures, not spot. I thought that meant I understood the warnings. I didn’t know that the real risk was that I didn’t know which months I was buying into. The funny truth is that they weren’t even making most of their moves on Monday. I was WAY off.
* **Don’t trust third party sources on the details - not even your bank.** Both Yahoo Finance, and my bank - RBC Direct Investing - have incorrect information on USO and most major ETFs. For as long as I have been looking (2 weeks), they've said USO is holding April WTI Futures. This is 100% false: [https://i.imgur.com/bOm0JEQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/bOm0JEQ.png) I thought this meant that USO had to sell all those contracts and move into May contracts on Monday. I thought USO was being paid to take a bunch of oil that they would then have all month to get rid of. But that's not how this works.
* **The word “ETF” is used extremely loosely.** An ETF like SPY or ZQQ.to, is absolutely nothing like all the ETFs out there that are “attempting to track daily movements of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_”. An ""ETF"" is just a fund. Don’t buy into ETFs that you do not FULLY understand. Read the actual prospectus.
* **Do not underestimate the number of stupid investors out there.** As I watched WTI plummet in real time, I immediately saw USO skyrocketing, I thought for sure that meant that smart institutional money was piling into USO. I thought there was no way that retail investors could move a $2.5B fund that fast, but they were. That was not smart money causing the pump. It was a million idiots like me.
* **Don’t fuck around with leveraged ETFs.** In addition to USO, I purchased into a 2X leveraged WTI tracking ETF “HOU.to” at the very end of the day on Monday. I thought for sure on Tuesday morning the oil prices would bounce back up from negative, and give me a big bump. I figured, even if it didn’t work out, I could hold onto it forever until oil comes back. Wrong. You cannot hold onto these things forever. They trend towards 0 mathematically. If you can’t make gains in your first couple of days or weeks, you are probably stuck with taking a loss. You shouldn’t even hold these things more than a single trading day. ESPECIALLY in this crazy market.
* **Despite your Father's advice, you can't just be patient and hold on to everything.** [HOU.to](https://HOU.to) \- which I purchased into - is beyond toast. The company has all but told investors it’s time to cash out. After the fund lost 40% of it’s value on Tuesday, they froze it, and then released an official press release that the ETF was worth about 1/6th of its already obliterated market price. They then said pretty clearly that they no longer expected to be able to achieve the funds objectives. After a few cuss words, I basically kissed my money goodbye. Then much to my pleasant surprise, on Wednesday morning, I saw it was back up for trade. Somehow it was rising. (This goes back to not underestimating the power of stupid money.) I cashed out immediately, and was very pleased to get 2 /3 of my money back. Everyone around me was telling me to be patient and not take a loss. The fund has done nothing but post double digit losses since then, yet millions of people are continuing to trade it, when they should instead be cutting their losses. While June futures are up 70% since Tuesday, this 2x ETF is down like 50% - yet people still cling on.
* **The biggest lesson in these oil ETF’s is that NOTHING is certain in this crazy ass market.** A TON of the pain that I felt this week was caused by USO and other funds like them restructuring. USO has been rolling front month futures on a predictable calendar for 12 years. On Tuesday morning they absolutely fucked my investment in USO, and probably contributed to the obliteration of HOU.to by surprising us all with a restructuring announcement. I never in my life thought that USO was going to restructure. I thought the whole point of it was that they were legally obligated to follow a certain predictable futures trading pattern - and that certainty gave people a mechanism to buy and sell. NOPE. They can legally just do whatever the hell they want, costing retail investors like me an arm and a leg, while their fund managers continue to make 7 figure salaries.
* **Last but certainly not least, this week should be a lesson to us all that there are mammoth sized financial incongruities hidden in every corner of the global economy right now.** The insanity that has taken place in the oil industry this week should be a warning bell to us all. The 2008 crisis was caused by bad assets in a SINGLE industry. Considering the demand for everything is down by at least 30%, and the governments have propped the world up with free cash equivalent to over 10% of global GDP - it’s quite certain that there are “sub prime mortgage backed security” equivalent death traps forming in every single industry. It’s only a matter of time before more of them pop up. They could appear on Monday. They could appear in August. But anyone who is paying attention is fairly certain they are out there.

U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in March, spurred by increased vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government, cementing expectations that an economic boom was underway.

Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was be the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.”

Economists expect job growth will average at least 700,000 per month in the second and third quarters. That, combined with the fiscal stimulus and about $19 trillion in excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, is expected to unleash a powerful wave of pent-up demand.   

First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter.

v96u59,2022-06-10,2022-06-10 08:37:51,"Inflation rose 8.6% in May, highest since 1981","[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/consumer-price-index-may-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/consumer-price-index-may-2022.html)

 

Inflation accelerated further in May, with prices rising 8.6% from a  year ago for the fastest increase since December 1981, the Bureau of  Labor Statistics reported Friday.

The consumer price index, a  wide-ranging measure of goods and services prices, increased even more  than the 8.3% Dow Jones estimate. Excluding volatile food and energy  prices, so-called core CPI was up 6%, slightly higher than the 5.9%  estimate.

On a monthly basis, headline CPI was up 1% while core rose 0.6%, compared to respective estimates of 0.7% and 0.5%.

Surging shelter, gasoline and food prices all contributed to the increase.

Energy  prices broadly rose 3.9% from a month ago, bringing the annual gain to  34.6%. Within the category, fuel oil posted a 16.9% monthly gain,  pushing the 12-month surge to 106.7%.

Shelter costs, which account  for about a one-third weighting on the CPI, rose 0.6% for the month,  the fastest one-month gain since March 2004. The 5.5% 12-month gain is  the most since February 1991.

Finally, food costs climbed another 1.2% in May, bringing the year-over-year gain to 10.1%.

Those  escalating prices meant workers took another pay cut during the month.  Real wages when accounting for inflation fell 0.6% in April, even though  average hourly earnings rose 0.3%. On a 12-month basis, real average  hourly earnings were down 3%.

Markets reacted negatively to the  report, with stock futures indicating a sharply lower open on Wall  Street and government bond yields rising.

Some of the biggest increases came in airfares (up 12.6% on the month), used cars and trucks (1.8%), and dairy products (2.9%).

Friday’s numbers dented hopes that inflation may have peaked and adds to fears that the U.S. economy is nearing a recession.

The  inflation report comes with the Federal Reserve in the early stages of a  rate-hiking campaign to slow growth and bring down prices. May’s report  likely solidifies the likelihood of multiple 50 basis point interest  rate increases ahead.

“Obviously, nothing is good in this report,”  said Julian Bridgen, president of MI2 Partners, a global macroeconomic  research firm. “There is nothing in there that’s going to give the Fed  any cheer. ... I struggle to see how the Fed can back off.”

With  75 basis points of interest rate rises already under its belt, markets  widely expect the Fed to continue tightening policy through the year and  possibly into 2023. The central bank’s benchmark short-term borrowing  rate is currently anchored around 0.75% -1% and is expected to rise to  2.75%-3% by the end of the year, according to CME Group estimates.

Inflation has been a political headache for the White House and President [Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/).

Administration officials pin most of the blame for the surge on supply chain issues related to [the Covid pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/), imbalances created by outsized demand for goods over services, and [the Russian attack on Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html).

In  a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Biden said he will push for further  improvements to supply chains and continue efforts to bring down the  budget deficit.

However, he and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen  both have emphasized that much of the responsibility for lowering  inflation belongs to the Fed. The administration has largely denied that  the trillions of dollars directed toward Covid aid played a major role.

How  much the central bank will have to raise rates remains to be seen.  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers recently released a white paper  with a team of other economists that suggests the Fed will need to go  further than many are anticipating. The paper asserts that the current  inflation predicament is closer to the 1980s situation than it appears  because of differences in the ways that CPI is computed then and now.",2593,909,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/v96u59/inflation_rose_86_in_may_highest_since_1981/,all,Unknown,0.98

Sterling dipped as low as $1.1032 at 12:00 p.m. London time, around an hour after the measures were unveiled in the House of Commons.

The pound has been on a precipitous fall against the greenback this year, hitting levels this month not seen since 1985.

Friday’s measures were billed by the government as heralding a new era for the U.K. focused on growth, and included a mix of tax cuts and investment incentives for businesses.


Cuts include reduced taxes on property purchases effective immediately, a reversal of the 1.25% National Insurance hike, and a 1% decrease in basic income tax. The highest level of income tax effective at £150k or more (45%) is now completely scrapped.

In just this year alone, we are looking towards several key major catalysts such as: 

\- the SAFE act for MSOs to get access to banking  

\- uplisting to NYSE (US MSOs are currently traded as OTC leaving the vast majority of institutional investors on the outside looking in for now)

\- more states legalizing independently 

Decriminalization even without full legalization would be a major boon for growth but is not even necessary for growth to continue with more states legalizing and/or relaxing restrictions on MSOs. The 4 major players (Green Thumb, Cresco, Trulieve, and Curaleaf) are all on top in this. They maintained solid financials, limited debt/losses, huge expansion across all medical/recreational states and are almost certainly going to remain the big 4 post-legalization. A play across these 4 covers the majority of gains we'll see leading up to and after legalization.

Joint Statement by the Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC
March 12, 2023
WASHINGTON, DC -- The following statement was released by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell, and FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg:

Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system. This step will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth.

After receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and consulting with the President, Secretary Yellen approved actions enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, in a manner that fully protects all depositors. Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13.  No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer.

We are also announcing a similar systemic risk exception for Signature Bank, New York, New York, which was closed today by its state chartering authority. All depositors of this institution will be made whole.  As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer.

Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. Senior management has also been removed. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law.

Finally, the Federal Reserve Board on Sunday announced it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors. 

The U.S. banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry. Those reforms combined with today’s actions demonstrate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors’ savings remain safe.",2487,882,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11pscz8/us_government_guarantees_all_silicon_valley_bank/,all,Unknown,0.97

Selling your positions triggers a taxable event and creates a capital gains tax liability. Simply submit an ACATS transfer.,"All you need to do is initiate an ACATS transfer at your preferred receiving brokerage and your assets will transfer over in-kind, meaning that your stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc will transfer and cost basis for tax purposes will transfer over as well. 

All of the major brokers such as TD, Fidelity, Schwab, E*Trade, etc support ACAT transfers. 

Note: proprietary or non-transferable positions may still need to be liquidated, but all publicly traded instruments should be fine.  These transfers typically take 5 business days and you should refrain from transacting on the account when you are ready to transfer. Don’t have open limit orders, expiring options, recurring ACHs open otherwise RH will reject your request. 

Godspeed!!

Edit: I am not a tax advisor so nothing I say should be construed as tax advice, so I cannot tell you what you should or should not do.  Please consult a tax professional if you have specific questions.

Edit #2: Again, I am NOT offering advice to anyone. This post should not be interpreted as me telling you to transfer your account. That decision is fully YOURS to make. 

Edit #3: I kind of touched on this, but an ACATS transfer will lock your account for the duration of the transfer, preventing you from trading.

ukaei2,2022-05-07,2022-05-07 06:22:41,Nvidia fined $5.5 million by SEC for hiding how many gaming GPUs were sold to crypto miners,"Link to article from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/6/23059930/nvidia-sec-charges-fine-settlement-gaming-gpu-crypto-mining)

""Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to “gaming,” hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isn’t admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.

The charges stem from Nvidia’s fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line specifically for mining, attempting to prevent shortages for gamers. But employees apparently acknowledged that many gaming GPUs were still going to miners. “The company’s sales personnel, in particular in China, reported what they believed to be significant increases in demand for Gaming GPUs as a result of crypto mining,” the order says.

Given the boom-and-bust nature of cryptocurrency, this meant Nvidia’s sales numbers didn’t necessarily indicate reliable future growth, making investing in it riskier. “NVIDIA’s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company’s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,” the SEC alleges.

Despite this, Nvidia didn’t mention mining-related sales as a factor in its gaming division’s success. Meanwhile, it mentioned crypto as an important factor in other markets, which suggested to the SEC that it was being deliberately deceptive. And investors’ anxieties turned out to be well-founded. A crypto crash in late 2018 (along with a weakening Chinese market) led it to slash its quarterly earnings projections by $500 million and spurred a shareholder lawsuit.

“NVIDIA’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” says SEC Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit head Kristina Littman. “All issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.”""

[Edit] lots of people asking why this is illegal.

1j9ygro,2025-03-12,2025-03-12 19:46:22,Remembering stock market crash of 2022,"It’s easy to forget how short the market’s memory is.

Still remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.

Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.

Meta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren’t making money. Zuckerberg was ""burning billions"" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.

It wasn’t just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google’s ad revenue shrank. Microsoft’s growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.

And then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.

Meta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.

When markets are crashing, it feels like they’ll never go up again. When they’re at all-time highs, it feels like they’ll never go down. Neither is true.

So investors, it's going to be fine. Just be calm and hold tight. And if you can, keep buying.",2465,712,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j9ygro/remembering_stock_market_crash_of_2022/,all,Unknown,0.9

>Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.

>Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.

>Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,"" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.

>""Wild $T1mes!"" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.

>Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

>Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.

>""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.

>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).

>Consumer demand for electric vehicles is turning a corner in some major markets. The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe last month, consulting firm JATO Dynamics reported Monday. read more

>Tesla also appeared on Monday to be making progress resolving regulatory problems that threatened its business in China. The company said it had opened a new data and research center in Shanghai to comply with government requirements that data collected from vehicles in China stay in the country. read more

>However, Tesla faced new U.S. regulatory pressure on Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board's new chief sent Musk a letter questioning why Tesla was rolling out its ""Full Self Driving"" software even though the company has not officially responded to the NTSB's questions about the automated driving system's safety.

>""It (the Hertz order) puts an exclamation point under guidance for 50%+ growth in deliveries,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. ""Another solid piece of evidence EVs are going mainstream.""

>Tesla now faces the daunting day-to-day challenge of becoming a high-volume automaker growing at a rate not seen since the early 1900s when demand exploded for Henry Ford's Model T.

>Tesla is coping with an order backlog for its vehicles and extended supply chain disruptions. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned investors during a call last week that Tesla's near-term production goals will hinge on resolving those disruptions and ramping up two new, huge assembly and battery plants in Austin and Berlin. read more

>""There is quite an execution journey ahead of us,"" Kirkhorn said.

>Rivals are not sitting still. Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz brand, General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), and startups such as Lucid (LCID.O) and China's Xpeng (9868.HK) are all battling Tesla with new electric cars or trucks.

>Investors and analysts, for now, are looking past the near-term challenges. Morgan Stanley boosted its Tesla price target by 33% to $1,200 as the brokerage expects the electric carmaker to surpass 8 million deliveries in 2030.

>The Hertz deal also underscored the power of the Tesla brand, as the rental car company emerges from bankruptcy and aims to revive its once-dominant brand. Hertz's rescue is led by a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management.

>""We absolutely believe that this is going to be competitive advantage for us,"" interim Hertz CEO Mark Fields said of the Tesla order, due to be delivered by the end of 2022.

>""We want to be a leader in mobility. ... Getting customers experience with electrified vehicles is an absolute priority for us.""

>Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, making this order worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for its mass-market sedan.

>Fields declined to say how much Hertz was paying for the order. Tesla was not immediately available for comment.

>With the current order, Hertz said EVs will make up more than 20% of its global fleet. Fields cited the rising number of EVs for sale and consumer interest in electrified vehicles.

>Hertz also said it was installing thousands of chargers throughout its network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the United States and Europe.

>Tesla shares closed up 12.7% at $1,024.86.

x7yo4z,2022-09-07,2022-09-07 03:26:43,"Porsche IPO is so corrupt that if it goes through, I’m never investing into German stocks again","**TLDR**: the Porsche family is getting full control of Porsche the company literally for free. This is the main reason for the IPO. The way the IPO is structured will hurt VW and gullible investors buying into this. VW and its long-term strategy are thrown into disarray.

**TLDR (with light details):**

1. The Porsche family already owns a significant chunk of both VW and Porsche companies. But they want full control of the Porsche company.
2. They ousted the CEO of VW on a pretext and forced the IPO that benefits only them.
3. The family will get additional 25% of the Porsche, which will give them full control of the company.
4. The family is not paying a market price for 25% stake. In fact, they are not paying at all, because they forced VW to pay a dividend from the IPO proceeds, which the family will get by being a shareholder of VW.
5. Shares available to the public during the IPO are all non-voting.

**Long story**

The way the IPO is organized is a disgrace, and if the German government allows it to go through as is, I will have no faith in making long-term investments in German stocks anymore.

If this is legal under German laws, then I'm not buying. If this is illegal and they don't do anything, I'm not buying either.

To understand what and why is happening you need a little context, so here it is.

The Porsche family lost control of the Porsche company during the 2008 financial crisis. They wanted to buy VW but ended up in a weird financial situation where they instead had to give up control of Porsche to VW but got a controlling voting stake in VW.

The ownership structure is complicated, but in a simplified form it looks like this:

>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> VW company -> Porsche company

The IPO will make it look like this:

>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> VW company (>50% of voting rights)  
>  
>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> Porsche Company (>50% of voting rights)

The money flow is like this:

>The family “buys” 25% of voting shares from VW below market price with no competition.  
>  
>VW pays 50% of IPO proceeds as dividends.  
>  
>The family gets its money back from VW in the form of dividends.

This IPO would be a disaster even during normal times. VW is losing its best cash cow, for half the price, and the price is below market rate. But it’s happening during one of the worst times for IPOs ever. The stocks are in a global downturn, hammered by inflation, rising rates, quantitative tightening, supply chain issues, and ongoing war in Ukraine, which amplified all of the above and added energy crisis on top of that. Germany is in the worst economic situation since the fall of the Berlin wall.

This is not the right time to IPO a luxurious brand. However, this is the best time for the family to get their favorite asset out of VW. From their perspective, the less money IPO makes, the better. This conflict of interests is as bad as it gets.

IPO shares available to the public will be useless non-voting shares for gullible investors, who do not understand what they are buying. Think SNAP or GOOG. But it gets worse.

Let’s remember for a moment, that VW was not a good company for a long while. It ended up in a “diesel gate” scandal, had to pay enormous fines, as well as to change its CEO. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because VW got a good new CEO, had to reinvent itself by becoming more environmentally friendly, and thus started an early transition into EVs.

VW is already a top seller of EVs in Europe and rapidly growing its market share. It has a vast portfolio of cars ranging all segments, from the cheapest economy cars to the most luxurious ones, of which Porsche is the main brand. Platforms within VW are interchangeable, they use the same tech across multiple brands to achieve synergy.

Now, if you take Porsche out, these plans are thrown into disarray. On top of that, both Porsche and VW will have the same CEO, answering to the same family. Which company do you think he will prioritize more when it comes to that?

What’s more, the transition to EVs was not going smooth already. There are issues with software, which VW was never good at historically. And the labor unions were very unhappy at the potential loss of jobs (because you need less jobs to make EVs). The family seized on this opportunity to oust the CEO under a pretext that the software was delayed, and the labor unions supported the change to get their job guarantees.

The labor unions now expect to keep their jobs, meaning VW will have to keep combustion engine factories operating for longer for no economical reason. This is good for workers, but a disaster for investors in VW. The family got their IPO, which is good for them, but also a disaster for investors. And the new CEO has no experience in building software whatsoever with no sound plans to address the problems.

The right change for VW would be to hire an experienced executive VP from one of the major tech companies in the US and improve their software development culture. There was no need to change their CEO, especially considering that VW was transitioning to EVs better than all of its competitors. But, oh well.

**My positions:**

I owned VW stock for a while and sold at \~2x profit after the war in Ukraine started but was planning to buy back later.

>The Seattle-based company, which operates a real-estate brokerage and home-listings website, said the decisions were made because it is predicting that the real-estate market is going to be smaller next year and its home-flipping business is losing money. It previously laid off 8% of its workforce in June of this year.

>The closure of Redfin’s home-flipping business, RedfinNow, follows Opendoor Technologies Inc. posting record losses last week. The biggest home-flipping company sold too many homes for less than their purchase price. Opendoor blamed the pace of rising interest rates for throttling the housing market faster than the company could predict.

rd9nos,2021-12-10,2021-12-10 09:19:19,"Inflation surged 6.8%, even more than expected, in November to fastest rate since 1982","From [the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/consumer-price-index-november-2021.html):

> The consumer price index, which measures the cost of a wide-ranging basket of goods and services, rose 0.8% for the month, good for a 6.8% pace on a year over year basis and the fastest rate since June 1982.

> Excluding food and energy prices, so-called core CPI was up 0.5% for the month and 4.9% from a year ago, which itself was the sharpest pickup since mid-1991.

Shelter costs came in at +3.8%:

> Shelter costs, which comprise about one-third of the CPI, increased 3.8% on the year, the highest since 2007 as the housing crisis accelerated.

An interesting observation was made in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/rd8rjn/inflation_surged_68_even_more_than_expected_in/hnzk9o9/) about this:

> It’s wild to consider the math here. 1/3 of the formula came in at 3.8% and the other factors still lifted this equation to 6.8%.

> The reporting on the 3.8% for shelter may raise eyebrows, but independent of disputing the data the raw math on this is shocking.

gal8gs,2020-04-29,2020-04-29 20:21:17,Elon Musk says orders to stay home are ‘fascist’ in expletive-laced rant during Tesla earnings call,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk lashed out at government stay at home orders as “fascist” in an expletive-laced rant on Tesla’s Q1 2020 earnings call.

While answering analysts’ questions about liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic, Musk called shelter-in-place orders “forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights.”


Musk said he was concerned about not being able to resume operations at the company’s factory in Fremont, California, saying that possibility should be considered “a serious risk” given Tesla produces most of its cars there in addition to its Shanghai-based plant. Tesla had initially said the factory it would remain open despite shelter-in -lace orders until the county where it’s located said it could not be considered an essential business. Six counties, including Alameda, where Tesla’s factory is located, recently extended their shelter-in-place orders through the end of May. 

Musk had spoken out about government restrictions on citizens during the coronavirus pandemic earlier on Twitter, but further expressed his opinion on Wednesday’s call while encouraging government officials to invest in infrastructure. He praised China for having “much better” infrastructure than the U.S.

“This is the time to think about the future, and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people’s rights as what is happening right now?” Musk said.

“I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry. It’s like somebody should be, if somebody wants to stay in the house that’s great, they should be allowed to stay in the house and they should not be compelled to leave. But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom.”

At another point on the call, he said, “So the expansion of the shelter in place or as we call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes, against all their constitutional rights, is my opinion, and breaking people’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong, and not why people came to America or built this country, excuse me. It’s outrage, it’s an outrage. It will cause loss, great, great harm, but not just to Tesla, but any company. And while people will weather the storm there are many small companies that will not,” he said.

He continued sounding more and more incensed, at one point asking, “What the f--k?”

The Bay Area’s orders do not say that people cannot leave their house, but do restrict non-essential businesses from staying open and ban many other activities, such as large public gatherings.

Some states, including Michigan and Texas, have seen protests of stay at home orders as fears about economic deterioration grow. But public health officials have cautioned that reopening too quickly could result in cases of Covid-19 re-accelerating and developing new hot spots that could overwhelm health systems.

1ny8yig,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 19:32:37,Do stock valuation metrics matter?,"Hi, I'm new to investment from EU.

I recently learned about stock valuation measures such as P/B, P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and more. However, I started to feel like these traditional stock valuation metrics do not really provide useful insights in fast-growing companies nowadays and which one to invest. For instance, the current stock price valuations on tech companies such as Tesla, Palantir, Nebius, AST Space, and IonQ are not justified by the metrics IMO. It seems like to me that the majority of the tech companies have very high premium price solely judged by the valuation metrics. Perhaps, it's just all about the AI, EV, and future technology hype, but their stock prices have been growing fast long enough even though people pointed out they are overvalued years ago. I don't think that professional investors are dumber than some random dudes using yahoo finance or seeking alpha and ignore all those numbers...  

As I see, qualitative properties (e.g, market trend, product outlook) have much stronger influence on the stock price. I'm not sure if I should be less concerned about the metrics and be more focused on what company does and the current market trend.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**1. Fake analyst ratings**  
  
Quantum Companies like **Quantum Computing Inc** (**QUBT**) have recently gotten a new promotional analyst rating from ""**Ascendiant Capital**"", raising their target from **22 usd** to **40 usd**. Now I know that these fake analyst ratings are normal within small-cap companies but once companies enter the 1 billion+ market cap, don't these companies automatically become subject to all the **SEC** rules and therefore this could be considered fraud even though **Ascendiant** discloses that it was a paid analyst rating? I'm not too sure on this but I asked ChatGPT and it said yes, and it gave me a wild theory, that they do this because of the government shutdown and the fact that 90% of the **SEC** is off on leave. (idk if this is true, but sounds absolutely insane and just maybe insane enough to be true). This conversely sent the stock flying and generated headlines on both Yahoo finance and tradingview.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**2. Dilution and Liquidity**  
  
2 weeks ago (15-18th of september) the vice president of **QUBT** sold off **100%** or **400.000** of his shares. October 1st **QUBT** diluted further 25m shares into the pool, and even though the market should have been bearish it ended up sending the stock flying up 25% in the first 30 mins of trading because of a short squeeze (i think).  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**3. Big cashout???**  
  
Everyone knows they're a scam, they pivoted from beverages to quantum and now sell vaporware. They already have several SEC filings against them and one for fraud would be detrimental. Could this rally just be in order to make sure there's sufficient liquidity for a cashout, now that their market cap is 4b+?

I'll give some quick context before, but if you're not interested you can skip to the bottom part! :) 

I am currently 19 years old and am trying to get into investing. I had a rough period but recently I learned to live life a bit healthier etc and also to manage my money a lot better. I still study, but work on the side every now and then as well, which gives me a small, but stable income. I'm planning on investing €200/month, with a self created trading plan. To start it off, I will be transfering all the money I have put in crypto's as well. (rn its about €1.8k, with 80% of profits, i put in €1k) so in short: DCA ing €200/month with a starting of almost €2k. 

I will be trying to get a portfolio for the very long term as I am still young, with relatively secure, small profits yearly, looking for like 5-10% a year on average (tell me if that's too ambitious pls). I have three questions however. 

TL;DR

1) I live in Belgium. Does anyone have suggestions for which trading platform I should use? I've been looking into trade republic, degiro, bux and interactive brokers. Right now I don't really know which one suits my plan better. any suggestions are welcome

2) My current Idea isn't extremely concrete yet, but at least its something :)   
\- 65% ETFs with 40% of worldwide ETF's, 10% emerging markets, 10% tech and 5% clean energy  
\- 20% Obligations  
\- 10% REIT (if possible with the brokers)  
\- 5% cash/gold   
Any feedback on this? better ideas or things you want to tell me? Goal is to get about an average of 5-10% profit yearly, accumulating 

3) Is it a good idea to start investing with my plan in about 2 weeks, or should I wait? I feel like the markets have been doing very well lately and I would hate to get in at the ATH's and see everything going down when the AI bubble pops. I've been reading a lot about it and I see what people mean by saying that. 

Any other advice you think can be relevant for a young, relatively unexperienced investor would be welcome! Thanks so much in advance :) ",1,1,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nxuxjs/starting_to_invest_monthly_at_19_a_few_questions/,new,Unknown,0.57

1nxs8yc,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 08:08:15,Advice on long term investments,"Hi im 22 from the UK and have been investing £200 monthly into VUSA for 3 years now and have built it up to £9.5k and im very happy with my progress but recently ive been feeling like due to my young age it would be a good idea to start investing into some individual stocks to have a potential of higher earnings in the future. Like the title suggests im in this for the long run 25-30 years and ive been doing some light research for the past couple days when i have time and have come to a conclusion that i want to start investing in the future of AI and robotics as they both obviously have huge potential that we are even starting to see today. 

I have chosen some stocks, i wont give my reasoning here yet as i still havent decided to pull the trigger on if i will start investing in them as i have deeper research into each company to do but i wanted to see what more experienced investors might think about the portfolio and what advice could be given in which to potentially not take and why or even why i should pick alternative stocks. 

The stocks im thinking of investing in and in what percentages are:
VUSA 60%
Tesla 9%
Nvidia 8%
Palantir 6%
Richtech robotics 5% (really on the fence) 
AMD 4% 
ASML 4% 
Broadcom 4% 

Id like to add that from this month onwards i will be investing £500 - £600 monthly rather than £200.

1nxpsq3,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 05:49:03,Is the Al Lending Boom Innovation or a Hidden Bubble?,"From what I know, I think the surge of capital into Al-enabled fintech, which led global funding to hit $100B in Q3 is less about consumer-facing genius and more about enterprise solutions fixing massive systemic problems, but this focus introduces a major hidden risk.

The facts driving this investment I think is:

1) VCs Target Enterprise: Over 80% of Al-enabled fintech funding goes to enterprise-focused startups because Al is solving complex legacy problems like accounting, data compliance, and risk profiling. Enterprise applications are receiving a majority of VC deal value (around 74.6% in 2025).

2) Al is primarily accelerating credit scoring and risk assessment. This allows fintechs to approve more loans with fewer risks than traditional models, making lending one of the most significant investment sectors.

3) As Al models become ""black boxes"" of complex data, the key challenge shifts to regulatory compliance and liability. If an opaque Al lending model introduces bias or failure, the risk of legal action and capital loss dramatically increases.

The conclusion is clear: the substantial capital inflow is driven by measurable efficiency gains, but it comes with a proportional rise in unseen risk.

I've laid out the data which I had got now I want your pov for the collective read: Is the bigger ""funding pain"" the challenge of accessing these high-value, exclusive enterprise deals, or is it the challenge of vetting the long-term, hidden compliance and liability risk of the Al models themselves?

Let's discuss solutions for adapting to this new diligence standard.

However, I have a special needs child who I want to leave my investment to when I pass so he can live off the annual returns. 
My plan is to travel a lot between retirement time age 60 to age 70 and cut down significantly on expenses at age 70. I am hoping I will not need more than 5% of my return on investment to supplement my income. I will have a good health plan with my pension and will be paying around $1400 mortgage. 

My question is with this plan, can I still leave at least the 500k investment for my special needs son? For those who have retired for a while, which age range is the most expensive during retirement? 

Edit: 
My mortgage will last another 10 years after retirement at 60. No car payments. My monthly expenses is about $5200 inclusive of mortgage payments. I have no debts. My investment is with Robinhood managed by them. (Currently about $ 225000 95% stocks). I also have about $125000 of which 80k is pretax and 45k Roth 403 b with my employer.

""deteriorating"" which is kind of scary to me
Fed won't usually use the word stagflation publicly because it has heavy negative weight in markets last major U.S stagflation was the 1970s). Instead, they phrase it in softer terms like ""deteriorating"" or ""imbalanced risks
And today AGAIN  Fed's Goolsbee said We are seeing both sides of Fed's mandate ""deteriorate"".

This looks like a stagflation warning in disguise.
That combination stagflation risk (weak growth + sticky inflation
Fed's dual mandate price stability (inflation) and maximum employment.

If both sides are deteriorating, it suggests:
Inflation may not be under control (price stability weakening).

Labor market may be softening (unemployment risk rising)

tracking my actual behavior. Was checking my portfolio obsessively and making impulsive trades during every market swing.

Decided to try automated strategies as an experiment in removing emotions from investing. Took some research to find platforms I trusted but eventually connected my accounts and stepped back. 6 months later the results speak for themselves. Account is up 23% compared to 9% during the same period last year when I was actively managing everything. Fewer trades but way better timing and execution.

More importantly learned how much mental energy constant portfolio monitoring was consuming. Didn't realize how stressed I was until I stopped checking prices every hour. Work focus improved, relationship with family got better, started exercising regularly again. Biggest surprise was how much better the automated system handled market volatility. During the October selloff I would have panic sold everything. Instead the system kept executing strategies and recovered quickly while I slept peacefully.

Took about a month to break the habit of obsessive checking. Had to delete broker apps from my phone temporarily. Now I review performance maybe twice per week maximum. Still maintaining some individual stock positions for fun but the bulk of serious money is automated now. Scratches the stock picking itch without jeopardizing systematic returns.

This is entirely contained to my fidelity account, where I am building my emergency fund, and have stocks (mostly tech) allocated to shorter term investing - pretty much just extra ""wants"" budget that I want to grow to help for a down payment on a car if I want a nicer one once my current car is done, as well as for buying a cheap car to take to a local track (something I've always wanted to do)

I also am invested in FXAIX. This is the fund I am using for longer term investing, like for putting a down payment on a house (I don't feel entirely committed to my current city even though I love it) in 5 years+.

Anyway I guess my main question is related to my tech stocks.

I have a tech ETF that has returned 30% in the last year ish, up 500 dollars in value.

I also on a whim bought some planet labs stock earlier this year. I put 584 dollars in, and it has gone up 1300 dollars in value total.

Just like when I purchased this stock, I currently still see it as a gamble. I don't know anything about it lmao I just saw on paper that they were doing something well, and landing contracts. And they continued, and their stock continued to go up.

So on one hand I know I can't lose by taking profit, especially that amount, a 200% gain, and that it is risky to stay in on a single company that I know nothing about.

On the other hand, I'm young, and can afford to be risky. Especially since the money invested in that stock was all part of my wants budget in the first place.

Not sure what to do. I'm contributing 840 dollars a month to my fidelity account - total value of 17k, but only 3.5k in my money market position (liquid). I don't regret it yet, but up until like April if this year, I kept buying more stocks, contributing more to FXAIX, the tech ETF, and planet labs. Last time I bought was when the market tanked with the whole tariff thing, which, in hindsight, was a pretty baller move on my end I must say.

But my point is I want to finish my emergency fund first. While I have a really stable job, extra piece of mind doesn't hurt",0,12,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nx0e50/when_do_you_know_to_take_profits/,new,Unknown,0.22

On the side I do private investing through fidelity (which also offers a ROTH IRA). My company's 401k has a garbage match of 1.5% and the best funds available on average get 15% returns (per year).

I contribute 16% of my paycheck to that company 401k. With my remaining savings I first invest into a Roth IRA through through fidelity until it hits the yearly cap. Any savings beyond that goes into a taxable brokerage account. The Fidelity accounts on average have pulled returns greater than 30%  (per year).

* Netflix stock NFLX fell 2.4% Wednesday, a rare stumble on a day when the S&P 500 notched a record close above 6,700. One thing might be behind the fall – a post from a billionaire.
* Tesla boss Elon Musk echoed boycott calls, writing on X: “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids,” targeting the pro-transgender messaging of the animated series Dead End: Paranormal Park.
* The selloff may not be directly linked to his comments – stocks don’t usually move on culture-war tweets alone – but markets aren’t exactly immune to Musk’s megaphone either.

**Boycott Fears or Just Noise?**

* Investors might be quietly wondering whether this morphs into something bigger.After all, Netflix is no stranger to political or cultural backlash – though historically, it shrugs these off.
* Streaming is sticky. Cancel campaigns have rarely translated into a sustained drop in subscribers, especially given Netflix’s scale and diversified content library.
* Still, even the perception of reputational risk can move a stock in the short term, particularly when traders are hunting for reasons in an otherwise bullish tape.

**Bigger Picture Still Strong**

* Context: Netflix shares are up 32% this year, well ahead of the S&P 500’s 14% gain, proving investors see the platform as resilient in choppy macro conditions.
* Growth levers like ad-supported tiers, password-sharing crackdowns, and global expansion continue to fuel optimism, even if one-off controversies grab headlines.
* Musk’s post may not ding the fundamentals, but it added a twist to a day when Netflix underperformed while the rest of Big Tech marched higher.",0,3,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwvl68/nflx_netflix_stock_sheds_24_was_it_because_of/,new,Unknown,0.41
1nwvgqn,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 06:32:30,FX/crypto investing or speculation?,"Most of my money is in ETFs and individual stocks, which I think of as “real investing.” I try to stick to long-term strategies, diversify, and avoid chasing hype. Lately, though, I’ve been dabbling with a small FX and BTC account, mostly out of curiosity and to experiment with shorter-term trading strategies. The thing is, it feels very different from the stock/ETF world. The speed, the volatility, the way positions can swing in a matter of minutes or hours, it’s almost a completely different mindset.

Because of that, I’ve been wondering: should a small FX or crypto account really count as investing, or is it just pure speculation? On one hand, you’re still putting capital to work, analyzing charts or economic indicators, and managing risk. On the other hand, the risk-reward profile and time horizon feel totally different from traditional investing.

I’m curious how other people approach this. Do you treat FX or crypto accounts as a legitimate part of your portfolio, or is it just a side hobby, almost like gambling but with more structure? And for those who do include it in their portfolio, how do you reconcile the extreme volatility with your broader investment strategy?

I’m interested in hearing different perspectives because I’m trying to figure out where I stand. Does it make sense to classify FX/BTC as investing if the account is small and experimental, or is it better to mentally separate it from my long-term ETF/stock holdings?",1,8,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwvgqn/fxcrypto_investing_or_speculation/,new,Unknown,0.57
1nwuua0,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 05:55:26,Realistic 10-year S&P 500 Returns,"**Are 10% annual returns realistic for the next decade?**  
Most investors on the internet talks about the expected 10% annual return, based on historical returns.  
But is that true for the market today?

Historically the market is much cheaper than today, many investors seem not to care about valuations, and think AI will make explosive growth which will justify current valuations. However, we have a P/E over 31, and a Shiller P/E over 40, history tells us this won't end pretty.

Lets look at the numbers and model out the scenarios, to see what we can expect for returns.  
For this model we need a low, medium and high terminal P/E (what P/E will the S&P 500 end at in 10 years)  
and we need low, medium and high estimated earnings growth numbers.

Historically P/E has a median of 15, this is too low since it goes back to the 1800s, but in the past 50 years, the P/E median is \~20, in the past 20 and 10 years, it's \~25.

So let's go with:

* low: 20
* mid: 25
* high: 30

For growth estimations I looked at the past 20 years of earnings, 50% of the years were below or equal to 4% CAGR, which means this is most likely, and 20% of the years were above or equal to 8% CAGR.

To give some room for more expected growth, let's go with:

* low: 4%
* mid: 6.5%
* high 10% (only seen 4 times since 1880)

*(Note: these aren’t conservative.)*

We now can get the terminal value:

Terminal value = current EPS \* (expected growh rate)\^10 years  
current EPS = 219.52

From here we can see what Compounded Annual Growth Rate will get to the current share price from the terminal value in 10 years. For my estimations I get the following annual returns from the estimations:

* high: \~9% annual return
* mid: \~4.7% annual return
* low: \~1% annual return

This shows another picture of what is preached about 10% annual returns.

**Before the AI bulls comment, please read the section in my article about AI.**

The S&P 500 is priced for perfection. But perfection almost never happens. At current valuations, investors are betting on a decade of above-average growth. Growth that history tells us is unlikely to materialize, and the assumptions are based on hype.

There are a few different research methods that I've found and liked, I wanted to create a discussion around them and see if there are any I'm missing out on.

1. 30 / 60 / 90 trend lines for timing the buys and sells over/under the line
2. Investors that publicly state buy/hold/sell suggestions (not any specific investor but monitoring multiple)
3. 3 / 6 / 12 month growth trends
4. Morning star risk rating, and fund classes 1-4 for balanced vs risky/industry specific funds
5. The 9 box val/growth and size metric and monitoring where in the chart I am vs where I want to be
6. Monitoring the percentage of investments (cash, foreign, domestic, ect)
7. Adding up the amount of a single stock across multiple funds to prevent overinvesting to one unintentionally

As I was thinking this, I realized there are probably so many other tracking methods that other people might need to be able to effectively use it. So I want to see what else is out there, and if there are some tools that exist (i.e. I dont want to spend the time to build something that I could just use freely, or not pay much for)

Not sure if everybody is following the podcasts, but for those who listened to this particular episode how is your conviction about factor investing?

 1) Publication bias: everyone want interesting things to read. According that, the sample chosen might indicate data mining, which can not be aligned with the out sample.
 2) Premium decay: arbitrages occurred already on the past due exchange of information, but now our capacity to share, analyse and execute everything has over escalated. So, lets say that the reaction to arbitrage is much faster.

After finally saving money and having some free cash to invest (10k) this march(2025), I put it in the market. I started with regular stocks and then went into options. All went well, I gained around 200$, then with options I was making gains of $3000. I got overconfident as usual and then the market tanked in April and I lost all my money. Basically totaling around $20k. From panic sells and what not. Ever since then I’ve been just in a deep state of depression about myself as a person, I blamed myself and I was embarrassed and thought I could do nothing right. Seeing the market reach ATH the moment I exited the market, and keep rising every day checking stocks daily just to see new highs made me feel even worse.

I recently found more inner peace by focusing on stuff that actually matters. Been going to the gym and spending more time outside and with people. 
Financially however things are not looking too bright. I still deal with a complete lack of confidence, embarrassment about money and yet another fear that once I start investing I will just lose it all ..

I believe NTLA is setting up for a potentially big move. Two major clinical data readouts are expected soon, one for nex-z (ATTR-CM) and another for lonvo-z (HAE). Both use in vivo CRISPR editing, which has huge financial advantages over ex vivo: it’s more scalable, less costly, and can be delivered as a one-time therapy without the complex, well.. ex vivo, steps.

Declining interest rates, high short interest and possibility for cnpv voucher are also something to consider.

I have strong belief what Intellia is doing and how it’s doing those things (CEO is very good imo). First BLA application should be submitted in 2026 and pipeline is only getting more interesting after that in coming next years. Interested to hear what do you think about in vivo crispr editing or Intellia specifically?

12% Emerging Markets 

14% U.S. Small Cap Value

I have always thought that when it triggered, I would then sell a specific (different) losing position at the same time.  And lately, I learned about Conditional Orders, specifically O-T-O, one triggers other.  (""Wow, how convenient is that!"")

Read about it.  I'm not always connected to the market in the first couple of hours -- most of my trades really do happen almost unexpectedly, on a morning gap-up -- so  it seems to fit my need perfectly.  Tried to construct such a trade order this morning. 

And I learned ... that's NOT how they work.  You can't have two different holdings.  You apparently can only connect two different order TYPES for the SAME holding.  Sell it, enter a repurchase order automatically, for example.

I can't see how that's the least bit useful!

SO, THE QUESTION: UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS \*IS\* THAT TYPE OF ORDER USEFUL?  When would I want to automate a limit sell and a buy or the same stock?  Or a limit sell and another limit sell?  Who is the primary user of such an order ... daytraders?

Testing out the waters with stop limit quotes.  Invested in some tech stocks that people think will go higher, while others say they're primed for a crash/correction.  Playing with small amounts of $, but using stop limit quotes to sell.

My gains in these stocks here have already increased by 10-40% in the past few months.  Is that 5% gap big enough to create a likelihood that the sale will execute, in case there happens to be a quick drop in price below the LIMIT?  Is there an ideal gap between STOP and LIMIT?

Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious. 

Social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to pig-buthering scams and pump-and-dump scams. - do not assume that an offer to ""help"" is legitimate.

1. Good explanation of pig-buthering here - [Pig butchering - how to spot](https://dfpi.ca.gov/news/insights/pig-butchering-how-to-spot-and-report-the-scam/)
2. Legitimate investment advisors do not use WhatApp, Telegram, Discord, etc. to provide tips. In the US - it is against regulation - specifically SEC Rule 17a-4 and FINRA Rule 3110. For example - brokers in the US that use social media for support do not offer investment advice. 
3. It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams. It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else.
4. Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media - bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks.
5. One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.
6. Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake. If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser, be wary.

Depending on where you live -  you can verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser. Most countries have legal requirements for investment advisors and brokers to be registered. 

United States - check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here - [https://brokercheck.finra.org/](https://brokercheck.finra.org/) You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here - [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)

If you believe that you or someone has been the victim of a trading or investing scam. Be aware of the following:

1. Do not send more money. Do not provide additional banking or credit card information. 
2. It is common to be contacted by additional scammers who may pretend to be law enforcement or private services to offer to ""recover"" funds for payment. This is a common follow-up scam. Law enforcement will never ask for money. 
3. If a login account was created. The password used is compromised. Change all passwords that are used. The password will be shared and sold to other scammers.

Here’s how I see it:

* Short term: it’s going to push costs higher. $14B isn’t pocket change, and I wouldn’t be surprised if this weighs on margins in upcoming quarters.
* Long term: this screams commitment to AI. Meta isn’t just playing around with chatbots or ads they’re building infrastructure that powers recommendation systems, future metaverse projects, and whatever comes next in large-scale AI.
* Competitive angle: it positions them to better compete with the giants already dominating cloud + AI Microsoft, Google, Amazon. Instead of renting capacity, Meta is basically locking down the horsepower they’ll need for the next decade.

Personally, I like seeing this move. It reminds me of when Amazon poured billions into AWS back in the day. Painful upfront, but it turned into one of their biggest growth engines.

1nuzdzn,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 00:59:18,Why I keep buying uber shares below 100 everyday,"Here are few reasons Why I am bullish and why I think uber is still cheap below hundred.
I am on my mission to make uber my no 1 position in my portfolio.

1)   $40B+ annual revenue, growing double digits, yet still priced cheaper than many mid-cap techs.

2) Over $1B+ FCF, with potential to compound and I dont think it’s priced in.

3) stakes in Grab and Didi

4) Partners & Key Moves Uber & Lucid: Nuro is supplying the self-driving tech for a robotaxi fleet of Lucid SUVs, to be deployed via Uber’s service. 20,000+ robotaxis over 6 years starting ~2026. 

5) Nuro has years of delivery-bot testing, deployment in limited domains; its robotaxi program via Uber-Lucid is just ramping up.  
So basically what nuro does it builds its own autonomous driving technology so instead of selling cars like tesla it sells the brains basically self driving technology.
So I tell how uber can use it for its advantage as uber.
So basically Lucid makes the cars, Nuro integrates their Autonomous tech into their cars and uber put  it on their platform.
I know it can put pressure on margins but I think uber will find its way to increase their margins somehow trust the management.

I know and understand the definition of book and market value (ie book and market value of equity). What I don't understand is why the market doesn't consider book value (wholly) when making investment choices and why they indirectly mix together accounting with other valuation methods instead.

In your traditional university stock competition, the main valuation you undertake for a stock is the DCF ie cash flow discounting to get enterprise value, then minus debt and add cash/non op assets (roughly) to get Equity value. Now, I compare that to the market price.

  
I have a problem with this because its mixing up accounting principles with market perception of value.

Book equity value is just Assets- Debt, and then  
Therefore, enterprise value is equity value + debt - non-operating assets (roughly)

  
Now, what I don't get is how we can use market cap equity value and then use accounting terms to get to enterprise value, or how we can simply use DCF to get enterprise value, then use accounting principles to get equity value.

  
We are combining methods of how markets wish to value things like enterprise value (DCF) or equity value (market cap), and then mixing accounting principles even tho the accounting view and market perception view are not using the same basis, so how can we mix both LOGICS??????????

It seems like at least every other day, there is a doom and gloom story that the market is going to go down. Sometimes I look up the author and notice that their background is in journalism, and they have no formal education in business, or finance or economics. Sometimes I notice the people writing these articles are just out of college.  
I'm starting to wonder if the media companies require a certain amount of these doom and gloom articles to be put out every week, simply because it draws on fear and fear gets more clicks, which in turn gets more eyeballs on their ads. It would be interesting to look at all the articles that have been put out over the last 20 years or so to see if this is the way it has always been, no matter what is happening in the market. My guess is it has always been this way.  
Chatgpt made what I thought was a good point in saying, ""they put articles like this out, because markets are cyclical , and they know, eventually they will be correct."" If that is true, I find that very disingenuous.  
There have been bull runs that lasted 11 years. From what I looked up, it was 2009 to 2020. I can't say for sure, but my guess is these media companies were putting out doom and gloom articles the entire time.

Still I need to read news on the stock market but I'm growing tired of constantly seeing this stuff. I can ignore the article but I can't ignore the sensationalist leaning headlines.

not telling anyone to buy (do what you want, it’s your money). I just think it’s funny how this is like the one vice industry wall street doesn’t openly mess with even tho it’s probably bigger than half the stuff they pump.

1nufyxd,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 11:17:11,"Honeywell, spin off, next General Electric? Opportunity? Division into 3 new companies: Materials, Automation and Aviation.","In 2021, General Electric decided to dismantle its historic conglomerate by dividing it into three autonomous companies: GE Aerospace, GE Vernova and GE HealthCare.

The overall capitalization of the three companies rose to around 474 billion dollars, compared to 290 billion before the split. In other words, the market recognized over 180 billion in additional value thanks to the separation.

Why does this happen? There are three main reasons. First: conglomerates often suffer from a market ""discount"", because investors struggle to give the right value to very different businesses. By separating them, each company becomes more readable and comparable to direct competitors. Second: capital management improves, because each entity can invest without having to compromise with the needs of other divisions. Third: a dedicated board of directors and management can move with greater clarity and accountability.

Let's talk about Honeywell. Today the company is organized into four major areas: Aerospace, Safety and Productivity Solutions, Building Technologies and Energy and Sustainability. Translated into a post-spinoff scenario, we could imagine three companies: Honeywell Aerospace, Honeywell Automation (which would combine the first two non-aerospace divisions), and Solstice Advanced Materials, focused on specialty chemistry and decarbonization technologies.

The shareholder letter decided to give 1 share of solstice for each share of Honeywell. The split of the other 2 divisions is expected at the end of 2026.

The Aerospace segment is by far the strongest and represents the main source of revenue. Honeywell supplies avionics, engines and auxiliary systems to giants such as Boeing and Airbus, but also to military aircraft and even future eVTOLs such as those from Joby Aviation. In addition to this, a significant portion comes from after-sales services: maintenance, repairs and overhauls which guarantee recurring flows.

Honeywell Automation, on the other hand, would focus on industrial automation, intelligent warehouses and security solutions. Think of scanners, robotics and voice-picking systems in Amazon warehouses, gas detectors and PPE for industrial workers, or energy and fire management systems for complex buildings such as airports and university campuses.

Finally, Solstice Advanced Materials would represent the “greener” and more futuristic side: CO₂ capture, green hydrogen, advanced battery materials and sustainable chemical solutions. A reality in its own right, with a positioning perfectly in line with the ESG priorities of global investors.

For an investor there are three paths. The first is to buy Honeywell shares now and wait for the split, then deciding whether to keep all the companies or sell the less interesting ones. The second is to wait for the spin-off and bet directly on the most promising horse, which in all likelihood will be Aerospace.

A recent research note from a major international bank initiated coverage on one of the L4 players, WeRide, with an optimistic outlook. The report set a $20 target price. The bank’s reasonings:  
  
One, global reach. The company holds autonomous driving permits in a reported seven countries. This globalization focus is cited as a significant first-mover advantage, especially in international markets.  
  
Two, valuation logic. The $20 projection wasn't just a number; it was based on a discounted cash flow model. The analyst's conclusion is that the stock is 'undervalued compared to peers'.  
  
This brings up a crucial question for anyone looking at this space:

WFC has even gained 66%! And it's revenue hasn't moved in the last two years!!! (literally sitting at just 82 billion $ from 2023 till now TTM) Why the expected growth if the valuation metrics don't matter?

Looking at their valuation metrics they seem very overvalued. It doesn't appear to be related to an sector/industry hype, because NECB is a regional bank with solid fundamentals, yet it continues to drop without any reason/negative news. Sure I cannot compare a regional bank to worldwide bank like that, but after all we are interested in the value investing when not speculating and I don't see the value in buying 25% profit margin banks with 13-16 PE ratios. How are those banks safer bets compared to NECB with 6 PE ratio, 43% profit margin (double compared to some big banks), higher dividend (around 2 times bigger, as they just 1 month ago released a special dividend not present on the calculations) and many other metrics being better like PB and return on assets.

Let me explain: I have been trying to buy a few Muni's on Fidelity and while several of the available bonds have an ""Ask"" and a Minimum listed, hardly any had any ""Bids"". Moreover, the couple that had Bids listed next to them had significant spread and when I put a bid that was HIGHER than that was listed, my orders fell through. That means the seller was unwilling to budge and could be sitting on the Munis for a long time. Hence my question about the liquidity of these securities?

This bond is trading at a **discount** evident by the fact that it is selling below its face value (75<100), and also because the current yield is higher than the coupon rate (when prices go down, it pushes current yield above fixed coupon!).   
The reason it is trading at a discount is because its coupon rate (3%) is less than that of similar government bonds at 4.297%. Investors aren’t willing to pay full price for it. Because of this, demand for this bond has fallen, lowering its price, until its YTM   aligns with similar bonds (RBA benchmark: 4.297% and YTM = 4.88%)   
Additionally, the YTM value is greater the the current yield indicating it is at a discount, and it shows investors will have a capital gain at maturity. *(Fernando 2022)*",1,1,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nu072y/how_correct_is_my_analysis_of_this_bond/,new,Unknown,0.57

I do know that the general argument for growth over dividends is that dividends are immediately taxed and you do not control when that happens, whereas with selling appreciated stock, you have (some) control over the tax implications.

On the other hand, with dividends, I understand that there is a certain advantage to reinvesting dividends and picking up stock at a potentially lower price during lean times.

Majority of my wealth is in US based tech RSU (\~60%) that has been performing above my expectations. Primarily for diversification, I want to bring it down to 30% in the next 6-8 months.

Note: I am intentionally not seeking broad market indices for the next 5-10 years.

|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Russell 1000 Growth UCITS|**R1GR**|50%|Growth focus, similar to SCHG, but less concentrated than the Nasdaq 100.|

|Momentum/Small-Cap ETFs|**SPMO/IDMO/AVDV**|25%|Split equally among these 3 for small-cap, momentum, and value exposure. (No good UCITS alternative found).|

1ntxs68,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 19:39:59,Extending the DCA concept to selling an ETF to buy a stock,"Previously, we had DCA to move periodically from a fixed amount of cash to equity.

When moving from a fixed amount of equity to cash, the equivalent of DCA (dollar sell averaging??) seems to be to sell a constant number of shares periodically. (There have been other posts on that.)

In the first case, you have the cash and can always buy the shares (assume fractional shares are possible.) If you adjust the cash you spend (e.g., via Value cost averaging) you may sometimes not have the cash available.

In the second case, if you sell a variable number of shares to meet a cash point, you may come to a point where you don't have enough shares to make that. If you sell a fixed proportion of the shares, you can always sell.

Now let's throw in another variable. I have an ETF that I am going to sell and a stock I am going to buy. The ETF shares can either be correlated with the stock, or not.

What is the minimum risk strategy for making the transfer?

1. If the two equities are correlated, do I sell a fixed number of ETF shares or a fixed value of ETF shares? The cash obtained is used to purchase the stock.
2. If the two equities are not correlated, do I sell a fixed number of ETF shares or a fixed value of ETF shares? The cash obtained is used to purchase the stock.

I suspect I need to write a program to simulate the various scenarios in order to answer this correctly. My intuition is leading me nowhere.",1,3,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntxs68/extending_the_dca_concept_to_selling_an_etf_to/,new,Unknown,0.57

1ntwo3a,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 18:51:32,1 year of investing: here is my outlook,"Hey guys I wanted to make a little list here of all of my wins and losses. My dos and donts of my personal finances.

So let's begin where ive been putting my money. Now im pretty happy with how I did it. I've had a huge sum just rotting (that's how you gotta see cash, as literally rotting) rotting in my bank account.

So step 1: get off your ass and put it in a mutual fund. ""Oh its not as good"" blah blah its better than just having it sit there and you do nothing about it. Procrastinate procrastinate... just do it.

Step 2: learn about ETFs. The more you learn about mutual funds the more you realize theyre ripping you off. So start putting your own money into a self directed investing account.

Step 2.5 (for canadians): Use TSFA or HSFA or RRSP. If you're young and make decent money, use HSFA. If you make very little money use TSFA. If you make a lot of money, use both. Remember there is a limit to how much you can put in and rules about them so go learn.

Step 3: dont start gambling. Basically you (me not you this is what I did) have no idea what youre doing and now youre just guessing what might go up or down. People on tik tok saying Costco is a buy or amazon or Google or whatever. I bought them all. I still have some but here's my rule right now: only hold what you're willing to lose. If you've got 1000 in your account then only holding 10 in Microsoft might seem like a failure since its up 19% so you might be tempted to put 200 in. But take it from me, im still holding onto stocks that ive over invested in and theyre losing. 

Step 4: go slow. You cant beat the market. Just put in money bit by bit. And if you have a big chunk of money, just put it into something safe and buy little by little every week. Set aside a reasonable amount from your paycheck and invest in the same reliable ETFs

Step 5: here is what i invest in:
40% S&P 500, (best option)
10% Gold and/or silver(market stablizer)
10% Uranium (betting on global turbulence)
20% Global markets (diversify)
20% China (risky wealth building) 

So my results after a year

My mutual fund with 60% of my money (in 1.5years) = +16%
My TSFA with 30% = +7.5%
My HSFA with 10% (8months) = +12.5%
S&P 500 = +19% (damn I really thought I did better than that)

1ntrlou,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 15:32:47,Dividends + Margin Account = Growth machine?,"(TLDR at the end, this is a long post)

So I had an idea, but it feels wildly too good to be true, and before risking my assets into a fool’s errand, I’d like to aggressively stress test it. I welcome all criticism and really want to build a strongman argument for (or against) it before moving forward.

I have been wracking my brain trying to find fault in it, and while I can see some obvious pitfalls, they have yet to convince me **not** to go forward.

First for context, we have been comfortably borrowing to invest for a while, and generating great returns with a healthy mix of growth etf’s + some generally high yield dividend split corps (think bk.to). We currently have approx 40% growth compared to the initial loan size, and are now generating 18.15% aggregate yield. On the side of this, I’ve been toying with a margin account, buying in and out of healthy canadian stocks with low volatility, and selling back a few cents above for small but fun profits. Grew about 1k to 5k in the last 6 weeks doing so, but I digress.

The idea that struck me is, what if I combined the power of 15% + yield machines with the extra buying power of a margin account. And I am not JUST talking about the 3.33x leverage it would give on day one, but the realization that every single distribution that comes in would theoretically further boost our buying power by the same 3.33x.

For the sake of argument, let’s assume a simple 30k/70k scenario in which I invest 30k and obtain 100k in buying power. Let’s also temporarily ignore any stock price change for now. Out of concern for a rapid market downturn and potential margin calls, let’s also stick to never using more than 60% of the total buying power. Meaning I’m only using 60k of the 100k on day 1, keeping a (I think) healthy 40k/40% spread from my max.

This 60k, invested at 15%, would net 9k a year, or a clean 750 per month. Normally, I’d reinvest that 750 month to month, meaning each distribution actually gets rolled into the 15% calculation and the actual result by the end of the year would be slightly higher than 15% (but of course, this would potentially be negated or further amplified by the price variations that will of course happen).

Now the real kicker here is that inside a margin trading account, that 750 is actually also leveraged at 30% and thus creates 2500 in new buying power. Using the same safety formula, let’s only use 60% (1500) and reinvest THAT. Now we’re making 15% of that additional 1500 (225/18.75 per month). 

Anyone can draw up a quick excel and understand how supercharged this makes DRIP/Div reinvesting. I did one, with a bunch of different variables, where you can play with the percentage of the max buying power used (you can even start aggressively at say 80% and then tone it down to 60% over the course or x months etc.), you can play with assumed yield, initial seeding money, you can set it to reserve a portion of the unused buying power for the borrowing costs and eventual tax cost that will inevitably become hard to sustain without tapping directly into the margin, borrowing rate etc. 

All of those variables slightly affect how much, but in all scenarios, you’re greatly speeding up the compounding effect, and one can, depending on risk level, initial seeding cash vs portfolio that is being leveraged, reach the equivalent of 5x the month 1 income after only 48 months. Anyone with sufficient time, ie 5-10 years could rapidly generate silly amounts of passive income (and portfolio size).

Here are my actual numbers as of today, in a very top-heavy, start-aggressive scenario:

**Aggressive Scenario**

Initial cash: 30k

Initial Portfolio leveraged: 210k

This gives me a potential buying power of 590k.



Using 95% of it on day 1 :  560,5k @ 18.15% (my current aggregate yield) = 96 644,21$ or 8 053,68 per month. 



This means that on mo 1, the dividend unlocks an additional 26 845,61 of buying power. Because I want to rapidly reduce my risk level and increase the cushion of used margin, I do the following:



\-First account for borrowing cost and eventual owed tax on those dividends  = 698,87 + 2953,60 = 4 506,66 (the borrowing cost is actually taken off of the remaining equity, and the tax cost I’m just choosing to artificially subtract from the remaining equity).



Of the remaining amount, I then reinvest a gradually decreasing %, so having started at 95, and aiming to reduce to 75 over the course of 48 months, I’m now reinvesting 94.58% of the buying power, = 21 222,01.

At 18.15%, this bumps my annual income to 100 496,01 or 8374,67, or a difference of 320.99/mo. That’s a 3.98% “salary raise” lol. Of course this happens month after month, and because everything is compounded, the rate of increase *also* increases. By the end of mo 12, with the math explained above, I should have gone up to 147 184,01 /yr, a 52.2% increase. By the end of year 4, this amount is up to 505 566,08. You don’t want to know what it looks like after 10 years, because it makes no sense to the human brain lol. (In any case I don’T think one could get there because the size of the loan gets above 5M which seems to be the margin loan limit, at least with my current broker - at any rate, by that point, one might want to start reducing their exposure and just enjoying the proceeds of what’s left, which would put any sane person MORE than very, very comfortable.

And this is where I’m starting to doubt what my eyes and my math is telling me - I’m a little (a lot) incredulous that this could actually work, and again, I’d like to fully stress test this notion because it feels too good to be true.

A few things I’ve thought of so no one wastes time on the basics - but by all means, if I missed something else that should be obvious, do enlighten me.



**A)All of this only works so long as there is drastic market drop/recession/war/pandemic etc.** 

This is where your individual risk tolerance varies, and one could choose to start with a lower borrowing power used %, say 65%, and stick to that. This slows down the math, but doesn’t change the fundamental effect of having dividend distributions leveraged at 3.3x (and then using whatever portion you’re comfortable with) 



**B)All of this only works so long as my yield remains that high, implying that none or very few of my securities crash, reduce, or stop their distribution altogether.**

Again, mileage may vary based on your comfort level with risk, and yes, it requires a lot of watching the market for signs of trouble. There is, of course, not a single thing that guarantees safety from such an event. In our specific case, we hedge against this knowing that we have an unusually high job security, a sizeable chunk of investment that will NOT be mixed up with any of this and that covers the full borrowed amount for at the very least the early, aggressive couple of months.



**C)Ultimately, margin calls, because of the above**

Yes, they happen, yes I understand how they can happen and what it would mean, and again, keeping a comfortable cushion + having a backup source of dry-ish funds to inject if shit hits the fan is key.



**D)Ballooning debt amount and inability to actually withdraw the dividends so long as the loan is not paid off**

In my 48 year scenario above, the loan has indeed reached a terrifying size of 2,785M. Because of how margins work, I’d have to wait until dividends reduce the margin-used portion (at 505k a year it would be over 5 years of not touching the money and letting the dividends pay it off, and I’m not even accounting for borrowing costs and taxation here), so the best way out I can think of is to just sell off the securities, shut down the margin account and cash out the entirety of the portfolio, to then reinvest it at more comfortable rates, whatever those may be. At the same 18.15%, and again, assuming no portfolio growth at all, we’d be looking at 241 361 of gross passive income, without any associated loan anymore.

And that’s it, that’s all I can think of, I might edit the post as I think or read some answers to save everyone time. What am I missing here? Any reason NOT to do this?



TL;DR: If one invests in a margin-trading account, and high yield securities (15% and up), those dividend distributions compound extremely fast since every new cash injection in the account adds 3.33x the amount in buying power. One can go from any modest initial seed money and very rapidly multiply their portfolio size, and passive income if that’s what you’re after. I think my math and my spreadsheet are clean, but I feel like it’s too good to be true, and I’d like someone to help me stress test the theory or point out whichever flaw I may have missed.

1nto9qg,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 13:27:47,Investment advice from a friend... WDYT?,"Imagine a situation. Jonny's portfolio is fully in stocks like PLTR, IONQ, OKLO, QUBT, etc... Jonny found them up on Reddit. He's happy with the portfolio being 5x in just a year, seeing how his 10k became 50k. What a deal! At night he dreams that the next year will bring another 5x and his 50k will turn into 250k. Power of compounding! He wonders if it's a good idea to take a loan and sell his girlfriend's jewels to invest in those ""5x"" stocks. When he's a millionaire, he will shower her with diamonds.

In search of advice, Jonny comes to a friend, Kattie, whom he respects for warning him about using leverage and teaching him the concept of volatility. That saved all his money in the past.

Jonny: Hey K! What do you think about that idea? I'm really afraid I'm missing a great opportunity to get rich. Those companies are sure to be the next Nvidia, Apple, and Google. I want to take a risk and go all in.

Kattie: Dude… why do you think these companies are great investments in the first place? Have you seen the financial results and checked the valuation? The P/E and P/S ratios are so insane that I wouldn't even bother looking deeper.

Jonny: You should see what people on Reddit are saying! This is the ultimate game, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. AI will replace all current jobs, and quantum will replace all modern computers. Just yesterday the CEO of that quantum stock said they're the next Nvidia. I'm already up 5x. It means something!

Kattie: Yeah, it means you're a gambler - and CEOs are really great at pumping hype and making themselves money. Look, successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Take your beloved Apple, Nvidia, or Google and look at their history. In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey. In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with its products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. In 2010 it still wasn't too late to buy Apple stock, right? In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was too late? Ha!

Jonny: I don't get your point.

Kattie: Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products, all because management is big on words, selling a ""we're the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action, in product. With a great business, you don't need a middleman selling you a story; you can witness the impact yourself. A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research; take your time. Even after five years, we'll still offer a great opportunity."" They are not loud, because they have a moat! A scam business sells you a beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist. Do you really think those companies you invested in are the next Nvidia, Google, and Apple? Have they demonstrated excellence multiple times over the previous years? Did they really changing the world? Do you see it yourself?

Jonny: Well, I guess we need to wait and see if they'll really create a product that will change our lives. Now I see why you brought up Google in 2005 - it was already impacting everyone's life, but it wasn't a missed opportunity. It was just the beginning.

Kattie: Exactly! Great companies continue to be great and reinvest their talent into developing more great stuff.

Jonny: What should I do with my portfolio? Sell it? Buy Nvidia and Google?

Kattie: I won't tell what you should do. If I were in this situation, I'd first consider myself very lucky. I made good money on a blind gamble. Thanks, life! Then I'd be smarter with my investments. I'd take my gambling profit and reinvest it into an index fund by dividing it into 24 equal chunks and buying one chunk every month. That would benefit me if the stock market crashes because of all the insane gambling hype happening right now. I'd use those two years to learn financial analysis and how to interpret companies balance sheets. That would give me the tools to invest in the market.

Jonny: But 5x, I really afraid that I might miss the next round.

Kattie: Remember, 99% of start-ups fail, even if at some point their stock price rises 10x in a short period of time. That means you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Short-term gains != long-term success. In a gamble, it's better to take a profit and leave the table. 

Jonny: I guess you're right. I'll ask what folks on Reddit think about this situation.

1ntlfop,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 11:41:49,Micron (MU) has lots of room to grow,"Micron Technology is a global leader in memory and storage solutions, a foundational part of nearly all modern electronics. Over the past six months, Micron’s share price has surged by nearly 70 percent, and its year-to-date gain now stands at over 92 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations.

Behind this rally lies Micron’s growing strategic importance in the AI and data center economy.
Its memory chips are increasingly essential for powering artificial intelligence applications, with top-tier customers like NVIDIA, Apple, Samsung, and Lenovo relying on Micron’s cutting-edge technology.

Top analysts from Citi, TDCowen, and Deutsche Bank remain bullish ahead of upcoming earnings, pointing to tailwinds from the expanding data center market, which is forecasted to grow by 33 percent annually through 2030. In Q4 2025 alone, analysts expect a staggering 109 percent year-over-year revenue increase.

With industry momentum, strong financials, and unmatched exposure to AI demand, Micron is shaping up to be one of the strongest long-term semiconductor bets of 2025.

Despite Micron’s impressive 2025 rally, many investors believe it still trades at a discount to its true value. The key reason is Micron's forward price-to-earnings ratio remains significantly lower than peers. Its 2026 forward P/E of just 9.72x is well below the semiconductor industry average.

This disconnect exists because much of Micron’s value lies in its exposure to high-bandwidth memory, a crucial technology for powering AI workloads. Micron’s HBM product lines are sold out through 2026 and the next-generation HBM4 chips are already generating buzz.

Micron is evolving from a cyclical chipmaker into a long-term growth story. With AI infrastructure booming, its undervaluation won’t last much longer.

Wall Street is focused on Micron ahead of its next earnings release. In recent weeks, Citi,
Mizuho, and Susquehanna all raised their price targets, with Citi and Susquehanna now
targeting $200 and Mizuho not far behind at $182.

Citi also reiterated its Buy rating, citing stronger-than-expected demand for AI-ready memory chips. Micron’s earnings per share expectations have risen accordingly, with investors anticipating continued upside surprises.

Micron already delivered an EPS of $3.03 in Q4 2025, significantly beating estimates, and
analysts expect the trend to continue. Key themes to watch in the upcoming report include AI product demand, margin guidance, and capacity updates for 2026.

The AI revolution is triggering a record wave of infrastructure investment. From Microsoft’s $30 billion supercomputer project in the UK to Nvidia’s backing of OpenAI with up to $100 billion in funding, the scale of global AI investment is massive.

Micron sits at the heart of this growth, supplying high-bandwidth DRAM and NAND memory required to keep AI models running. With OpenAI’s Stargate project planning
multi-gigawatt-scale data centers, Micron’s role as a memory provider is becoming even more critical.

Micron has even reorganized internally to reflect this shift, aligning its product roadmap to the growing demands of the AI and cloud markets.

Micron’s financial foundation is solid. The company continues to ramp up R&D investment, especially in AI-focused memory, while improving profitability. Recent quarters show operating margin expansion, and Micron’s R&D budget now exceeds historical averages, reflecting its strategy to stay ahead in HBM, DRAM, and NAND technology.

This combination of profitability improvements and innovation spending makes Micron uniquely well positioned to capitalize on future AI cycles.

Micron has built a strong track record of earnings performance, consistently delivering beats on EPS and revenue.

In Q4 2025, Micron reported an EPS of $3.03 compared to estimates ranging from $2.53 to
$2.86. Revenue was $11.3 billion, also above expectations. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double beats in fiscal 2025.

Micron has now beaten expectations for eight straight quarters. This consistency reflects both demand strength and operational execution and has been a key driver of investor confidence.

Micron remains attractively valued even after its run-up. Its forward P/E is 13.4x, well below the sector median of 19.2x. Its forward price-to-sales ratio near 3.7x is also lower than that of leading AI peers like Nvidia and AMD.
This valuation gap is notable, especially given Micron’s exposure to the same AI megatrends as its higher-multiple competitors. Even a re-rating to average sector multiples would imply a substantial upside, with some analysts suggesting prices well above $200 per share.
While the bullish case for Micron is strong, risks remain. 

Competition from Samsung and SK
Hynix is intensifying, particularly in high-bandwidth memory. The memory market itself is highly cyclical and could be affected by any slowdown in AI or cloud infrastructure spending.

There has also been regular insider selling and approximately $200 million in quarterly
stock-based compensation. Although much of this is standard practice in tech and not tied to
bearish sentiment, it still contributes to dilution. In addition, any missteps in yield, supply chains, or global trade could pressure margins.
Micron holds approximately $11.9 billion in cash and $14 billion in debt, resulting in low net
leverage. Its investment-grade profile gives it the flexibility to raise capital at favorable terms if needed. This reduces reliance on equity and helps limit shareholder dilution.

This financial strength provides a buffer against the memory industry’s inherent volatility and
supports Micron’s long-term strategy.
Looking further ahead, Micron’s FY2027 forward P/E projection is just 10.5x. This sets up an attractive long-term buying opportunity, particularly as AI spending is expected to grow
throughout the decade.

Micron is well positioned to benefit across multiple AI investment cycles, not just a short-term surge.

From a technical perspective, Micron’s RSI currently signals overbought conditions, suggesting the stock may cool off in the near term. However, its price remains well above the long-term simple moving average, confirming a strong bullish trend.

Crucially, the fundamentals support the technical momentum. Robust demand, earnings strength, and favorable industry trends provide a solid foundation, suggesting that any pullbacks may represent long-term buying opportunities.

Governments worldwide are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. The United States has
supported projects in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Norway, while other nations like the UK, UAE,
and Japan are also building next-gen AI facilities.

As a key supplier of high-performance memory, Micron stands to benefit from this global infrastructure buildout. Its products are necessary components in nearly every advanced AI deployment on the horizon.
Micron insiders, including CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, regularly sell shares through pre-scheduled trading plans. While the lack of insider buying may be seen as a mild negative, it is typical in the tech industry where executives are already highly exposed to company stock.

Micron also issues about $200 million in stock-based compensation each quarter. While this
contributes to modest dilution, it is not excessive compared to other major tech firms and is an accepted tool for attracting and retaining top talent.

Given Micron’s growing earnings and market position, this dilution is manageable and does not materially weaken the bullish case.

Micron offers a rare combination of explosive earnings growth, AI-driven product demand,
attractive valuation, and a strong balance sheet. While competition and market cycles require ongoing attention, the upside potential significantly outweighs the risks.

As Micron continues to execute and deliver results, it remains a strong buy ahead of earnings and into 2026.

Investor sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive. Retail traders view Micron as one of the leading beneficiaries of the AI boom, and institutional investors are showing strong conviction.

Hedge funds have increased their stakes and long-term investors like pension funds are holding steady.

With confidence from both Wall Street and Main Street, Micron is becoming one of the most widely embraced infrastructure plays in the AI space.

The semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation powered by AI and data. Micron
Technology sits at the center of this shift. As covered throughout this report, Micron’s rising
earnings, leadership in next-gen memory, and robust financial position give it a powerful
long-term edge.

The company is positioning itself for the future of technology, from generative AI to cloud
computing and beyond. Even after a substantial run-up in 2025, Micron remains attractively valued with room to grow.

All signs point to Micron Technology being a top semiconductor pick for 2025 and the years
ahead.",0,9,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntlfop/micron_mu_has_lots_of_room_to_grow/,new,Unknown,0.43

I've tried searching for the answer and am not finding it, so I'm hoping someone knows: 

When you invest in an index fund, what happens if one of the company disappears? 
(Eg it goes bankrupt or it closes) 
Especially if it is a higher percentage of the index fund? 

Does it differ if it's a mutual fund vs ETFs? 

Are the companies that compromise the index fund set in stone? 
Do you lose that percentage of your investment, or does it get reallocated into the other companies already in the index fund and the percentages for all get adjusted? 
Does the whole index fund get shut down, and money refunded or lost? 

Or does the manager/s of the index fund, find a different company to sub in for the company that no longer exists? 
Does this still happen if it's a passive fund? 
(Are they already swapping companies in and out if some are performing badly? I haven't been watching the complete makeup of funds I've already invested in to notice if they changed since I bought shares) 

I understand/assume there'd be a huge value loss immediately if this happened eap with large companies, so I'm not asking about the value per se, but what then happens with the fund? 



(I realised a lot of the index funds have the same couple of major companies making up a solid chunk of their allocation. I realise the likelihood of eg Amazon suddenly shutting down is incredibly minimal, and I do realise there are likely legal protections in place to prevent this occurring, but it made me very curious with ""but what if?!!"".

Why the surge?

1️⃣ Sports assets are seen as inflation hedge

2️⃣ Blend passion and prestige with long-term value creation

3️⃣ Patience is easier for family offices

The appetite is uneven:

➡️ 71% want exposure to men’s major leagues

➡️ Just 19% interested in women’s leagues

➡️ 31% interested in venues/RE and streaming technology

Blackstone's David Blitzer, is the first person with equity in all five US major sports leagues.

The question is - is FO investment a leading or lagging indicator of where to invest?

Neodymium is the leading option but Iron-Nitride is expected to surpass this when production increases in the long term.

1nse5u1,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 23:30:15,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

1nsa2sl,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 19:57:05,You can't beat the market by buying good companies for the same reason you can’t get rich betting on the best football teams,"The idea that information is “priced in” is a notoriously tricky concept for new investors (I know I struggled with it for a while), and it occurred to me that a sports betting analogy might help.

You can go out and bet on who is going to win tomorrow's NFL games, but for most of those games, there's a lot of information out there that leads people to expect that one team is more likely to win. Take, for example, tomorrow's Bills-Saints game. There's a lot of information suggesting that the Bills are a much better team, and are much more likely than the Saints to win. As a result, if you want to bet that the Bills will win, you're not going to find someone who will take the other side of that bet straight up.

To get someone to take the other side of the bet, you have to concede something: either give them better odds (ie they get a bigger payout if their unlikely bet pays off), or a spread, meaning a number of points that the favored team must win by for the bet to pay out (in this example, the Bills have to win by at least 15 tomorrow, if they win by 7, the people who bet on the Saints get the money). The expectation that the Bills are going to win is priced in, the odds or spread adjust until equal numbers of people are willing to take either side of the bet.

The stock market works the same way. There's a lot of information that leads people to expect that Apple will continue to grow and perform much better than the average company. As a result, to get someone to agree to sell you an Apple share, you have to pay a high price: 35 times Apple's current earnings per share (compared to an average of about 26.6 times for the US stock market as a whole). If everyone expects Apple to do better as a company than the market in general, the price of the stock will rise until there's an equal number of buyers and sellers. The expectation that Apple will have above average earnings in the future is already priced in, just like the expectation that the Bills will beat the Saints.

Everyone agrees the Bills will probably beat the Saints. To bet on it, you need to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. Everyone agrees Apple will probably have better earnings than the average company. To bet on it (ie buying Apple shares instead of a total market index fund), you have to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. You can't get rich betting on teams that everyone knows are good, and you can't beat the market buying companies that everyone knows are good. Available information is priced in.

Edit: I stopped watching football a while back, so the fact that the Bills are -14.5 vs the Saints is wild to me.

Edit2: If you think you have a method for finding mispriced stocks, that’s not necessarily in conflict with my point here. The point is that it’s more complicated than simply buying companies widely regarded as good, in contrast to what new investors often assume. (That said I do tend to be skeptical that retail investors can expect to find a market-beating strategy)

Edit 3: the Bills won 31-19, meaning that they won the game but did not cover the spread, and people who put money on the Saints won.",160,127,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nsa2sl/you_cant_beat_the_market_by_buying_good_companies/,new,Unknown,0.75

1nrrne6,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 06:17:01,Is Google still cheap? 10 year expected returns,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better.

However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it.

When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value.  
After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years.

From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500.

Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations.

Anyways here are the results:

FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR  
EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR  
Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR

So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price?  
Probably not.

Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs.

That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding.

Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels.

For me this is a clear hold.",276,140,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nrrne6/is_google_still_cheap_10_year_expected_returns/,new,Unknown,0.88

1nrohh5,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 02:54:04,Study shows wealthy investors react more strongly to financial stress (but recover confidence faster),"India does a national household survey consisting of 275,000+ responses. A research analyzing these responses found that higher income groups become significantly more pessimistic about current economic conditions during financial market stress, compared to lower income households. However, wealthy households show no increased pessimism about future economic prospects.

This likely reflects greater exposure to financial markets among wealthy households, they feel immediate stress from market volatility but have confidence in their long term financial resilience. I found this bit surprising as I thought people with lesser wealth would be more concerned about it being eroded away than the wealthy folks. 

The study also revealed that currency fluctuations and government debt spreads impact household confidence more than stock market volatility in India, which is the opposite pattern from developed economies where banking sector stress dominates.

The issues are things like sequence of return risk, percentage of withdrawals, increasing your holdings in bonds, all sorts of topics that just don't apply to people like us, who plan to live off our dividends in retirement.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the entire retirement ""industry"" is geared towards this, and not towards living off of dividends. My free advisor at Fidelity is definitely not oriented towards dividend investing, either now, or in retirement.

I feel like there's some information that I'm missing that only applies to dividend investing. Maybe things like switches in your investments to make now to reduce risk, maximizing dividend income safety, how to make sure your portfolio keeps ahead of inflation. I'm pretty sure that there's plenty of other topics that I'm missing.

It was priced monthly, so presumably marketable. It had a 10-12% yield, which was fairly typical for bond funds at the time. But the income was never reported on her her tax forms; however, it did show up as a ""RECIP DIST"" on the 1099s with a note, ""Your distributions have been adjusted to reflect proper tax reportability."" She had her taxes prepared by a CPA so presumably he knew what he was doing.

The NAV of the fund steadily declined over the 7 years she held it. I don't think the dividend was 100% return of capital. (What would be the point anyway of buying a fund that paid back mostly return of capital, unless it was some kind of tax oddity?)

I lost 80% of my portfolio due to too many call contracts (on another stock that was performing well). I turned $700CAD to $2600USD like a week ago (yes, I'm a poor). I've never earned that much money investing before, and I knew right then there I should just pull half out to lock in the gains, or wait a bit and go back in at an optimal when it has a reasonable dip. Or maybe look at some other stocks.

But no, instead stock started falling further, activated stop limits, price went down, caused more people to sell, activated more limit stops, etc. The stock had been lingering around 9.50 - 10.50 for almost a week - after that huge drop it went down to $7. What's worse is I had a reasonable number of puts (bought too high) and I wanted to get rid of them. Eventually it broke even and I sold it, thinking it would surge back up at any minute.

I was also buying additional calls because their price was so slow, I was sure that there would be at least a mild rally and I'd be able to get maybe 50 - 60% of my money back.

Eventually today it went up to 8.06, and I only had 2 days before expiring. I didn't want to risk holding onto it much longer only for it to fall more. So I sold it and lost $1200USD.

You know what the best part is? It raised 25% immediately the next day after I sold and I would earned over double if I just waited 12 more hours. It went up to like $9.10, and my breakeven was 9.12

This is about the “Prophet Trading Method,” a true golden tip.

There is a very famous prophet named Baba Vanga, known for an accuracy rate of about 85 percent.

If you read her prophecies carefully, you can see the future direction of humanity.

That is where you begin your reasoning.

Of course, not every prophecy comes true, but the important part is the overall direction they suggest.

You can view prophecy as an indicator of humanity’s general course.

So if you take long positions in sectors that align with that direction, even if you face temporary losses, some stocks will naturally rise over time.

For example, if you study the prophecies closely, you will find hints about breakthroughs in human biotechnology, solar energy, renewable energy, AI, quantum computing, and so on.

On the other hand, investing in directions not mentioned in the prophecies, such as oil or coal, could be considered a foolish choice.

The idea is simple. Take the results inferred from the prophecies, select the sectors that match, buy the ones that are undervalued, wait, and then sell when the time is right.

I personally invested heavily in Lithium Americas for its role in clean energy and waited a long time.

Recently, I was fortunate that Lithium Americas surged, and I made a good profit.

You can also find Baba Vanga’s prophecies on Wikipedia for reference.

If you are not sure, focus on renewable energy, AI, quantum computing, or biotechnology.

Part of the learning curve is recognizing the fact that a share price can decrease, without ANY fundamental change in the company. The company can absolutely obliterate all expectations, and the ""share price"" can still drop. 
My point is, I sold many lots early because I was new, and impatient. 
I've learned two things. 1- DCA all day. 2- if you believe in the companies fundamentals and nothing has changed, then do not react to outside influence. Do not sell, continue to DCA all day. 
Off the top of my head, I sold: RIG at 0.64, MP at 18, IONQ at 9, ZDGE at 2.4, WD at 43, INTC at 26, RGTI at 8, NOTE at 2, CARR at 55, GME at 13 (PRIOR TO THE SHORT), NIO at 4, ON at 30, RR at 1.40,  ERIC at 3.3, XOM at 60, GE at 130 (13 pre split), UPST at 19, MU at 50, TTD - i sold at 561, but its been RSd and I dont know today's equivalent. 

 All of those above are higher today, than my sell price. Also, when I sold, at whatever time, with the exception of WD and CARR (they where green, but nothing crazy) they where in the red, for sure. The moral of the story was, nothing changed. I sold due to a reaction of the market, NOT, the company. 
Here's the kicker. I'm still up 300% overall  and 1000%+ percent lots, because I learned my lesson. I identified my error, ( I used to panic )
I swallowed that lesson. Took it in stride, and made the change. I stuck with PLTR ( at its worse, down 90+ percent) , RKLB (worst , down 88+) , PL (down 60%). And have been DCA all day, and don't watch the day-to-day. The companies are execution, nothing has changed fundamentally, and the outcome has been nothing but amazing. The result? Today , I'm in the green 300%+ overall. Why? I identified my errors, and key point. ACCEPTED IT AS TRUE. Make the change. And win. (FYI I'm currently down 20% on LIDR, but, I cannot do my job without LIDAR, so for me, the need is there. Company fundamentals haven't changed, ill continue to DCA)

I already have a good amount of $VOO but i’m looking into diversifying to other ETFS as well BUT not stopping on purchasing $VOO. With its current pricing I’ve thought about putting in about $200 a month to purchase a fraction of it while the rest goes to other ETFs.

I’m trading under Fidelity Roth and I don’t plan on moving brokerages anytime soon (or at all). Are there any downsides other than having to liquidate later if I were to move to a different brokerage?

1nqrymi,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 00:24:21,"Is my explanation of how bonds work, correct?","Thank you very much for your help. Very much appreciated!



**How do bonds work?**  
Put as simply as I could:

1. Government/firm issues a bond with a coupon rate (interest rate) similar to the market interest rate.
2. **Primary market:** according to RBA (*2022),* when an investor has purchased the bond **for the first time,** this is called buying in the **primary** **market**. *(This first price of bond depends on interest rate, term of bond, and price of similar bonds).*
3. **In the primary market, the buyer pays the face (nominal) value of the bond, and the yield (aka return) matches the bonds coupon rate.** The buyer will want the coupon rate/yield to be higher than market interest rates.
4. But if later on the bondholder decides to sell the bond before maturity, (due to many factors) it will be sold on the '“**secondary market.”**
5. **In the secondary market -** bond market price fluctuates on top of the face value because of supply and demand. There are many factors affecting bond like competing market interest rates (shown below) and the yield of the bond. Makes sense, right? When market prices exceed the face value of a bond, you are paying at a premium. When market prices are below face value of a bond, you are paying at a discount
6. Bondholders will need to recalculate the yield, as the coupon rate no longer matches the yield (because market prices have changed). This is done using this simple formula: coupon / market price x 100 **The relationship between the market price and bond yield is inverse.** *(EconplusDal, 2017)*",10,9,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqrymi/is_my_explanation_of_how_bonds_work_correct/,new,Unknown,0.86

Right now I’m aiming for about a 70/30 split between individual stocks and an ETF. I’ve already funded the ETF side, but for the stock portion I’m trying to narrow down my picks.

My goal is to grow this portfolio at 15–20% annually (minimum) to outperform the ETF, then roll the gains back into ETFs later. I understand the risks and taxes involved, and I don’t mind some volatility since I’m still learning.

The main stocks I’m considering are:
	•	AMD – strong potential if they land new deals and improve their software side.
	•	UNH – looks undervalued; the investigation doesn’t seem too damaging, and the stock hasn’t fully corrected since the murder news.
	•	SHOP.TO – e-commerce is still growing, and last quarter’s earnings beat gave it a strong rebound.

I’m also keeping an eye on GOOGL and researching NVO.

I suspect a larger market correction is coming eventually, but I still think there’s time to benefit from the current bullish trend.

TL;DR: New investor, already in an ETF, now looking for individual stocks that can realistically return 15–20% yearly over the next few years. Thoughts on my picks (AMD, UNH, SHOP.TO) and any counters/alternatives?

1nqlo50,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 19:14:01,"SPT Sprout Social - No one talks about it, and i dont know why","Here’s everything you need to know about SPT - Sprout Social. If you still believe the company is not undervalued after reading this, I can’t help you.

1. In the era of AI, data plays a crucial role. Sprout Social connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this amount of data.

2. Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance.

3. Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.


Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:

- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.


Risks:
- „But there is an investigation“. That’s for wrongdoing. I think there were 200 cases like this last year. Let’s say they have to pay $25 million - $23 million will be paid by D&O, and Sprout will pay $2 million. Thats nothing.

- „I make more profit than they do“. Value doesn’t necessarily equate to profit. Over the past three years, they’ve acquired three companies. The product has received new features and a significant amount of AI integration. Growth is more crucial than profit, as profit will naturally follow. Sprinklr became profitable too early, resulting in revenue growth of about 6%, but the company is currently struggling. Sprout, on the other hand, has experienced double-digit revenue growth and is poised for even greater success as it shifts towards serving upmarket and larger customers, like Honda and NASCAR. Trust me, profits will follow.

- „High SBC“. Yes, this is true, and I don’t like it either. As far as I know, in 2023, they offered their employees SBC. However, at least SBC didn’t increase last year and instead remained flat. Nevertheless, SBC is high, and I don’t like it either. Without it, they would already be profitable. What’s important to me is that they are operational profitable, even though they are not GAAP-based. GAAP-based profit will follow.",0,16,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqlo50/spt_sprout_social_no_one_talks_about_it_and_i/,new,Unknown,0.38

1nqfbgz,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 14:57:19,Why do we insist on CRP when there is none?,"Let me use Turkey as an example.

There’s this idea that investors should require an extra risk premium when they invest outside the US. Sure, we can debate the whole “US exceptionalism” thing, but leaving that aside…

According to CAPM, you shouldn’t get compensated for risks you can diversify away. For instance, most European markets are pretty tightly correlated with the global market. So, no matter how much you diversify, you’re still basically exposed to the same risks.

Turkey, though, is different. Since the 2018 shift to the presidential system, its correlation with the MSCI World Index has been just 0.36, with an R² of 0.13. That’s really low. It basically means Turkey doesn’t move with world markets, so if you diversify, you can actually wash out most of its country-specific risks.

So my question is: why do we still tack on an extra risk premium for Turkey?

And here’s a bonus thought: Turkey’s equity risk premium has been close to zero, or even negative, whether you look from 2000 or from 2018. So investors might want an extra return for the risk, but the market itself doesn’t actually provide it. At the end of the day, your opportunity cost is what the real market gives you, and in Turkey’s case, that “extra risk” doesn’t translate into extra return.

1nqcnct,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 13:15:48,Is Auto-Investing in P2P lending a viable option?,"I’ve been exploring ways to diversify my investment strategy and read about the concept of auto-investing in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending on [https://lendermarket.com/lendermarket-risk-rating/](https://lendermarket.com/lendermarket-risk-rating/) . Essentially, P2P platforms allow you to automatically invest in consumer loans based on predefined criteria such as loan terms, interest rates, and risk ratings.

One of the key attractions of these platforms is the potential for relatively high returns. Many P2P lending platforms offer average annual returns in the range of 15-18%. While these returns can be appealing, they typically come with a higher risk profile compared to traditional investments, which is something to carefully consider.

To manage risk, many P2P lending platforms offer risk rating systems to evaluate loan originators. These ratings consider factors such as financial stability, legal structure, and transparency. By investing in loans with lower-risk originators, you can reduce the likelihood of defaults, though higher returns often come with higher risk.

A notable feature is the buyback guarantee offered by some platforms. If a loan becomes overdue for a certain period, the platform’s originator repurchases the loan, ensuring the principal and accrued interest are returned to the investor. This buyback provision can offer some peace of mind, but it’s essential to remember that there’s still a risk of delays or defaults, especially in cases where loans are extended multiple times.

Another consideration is the lack of liquidity in most P2P lending platforms. Unlike stocks or mutual funds, you can't sell your investments before they mature unless a secondary market is available. This means that your capital could be tied up for a significant period, potentially reducing flexibility in case you need to access funds quickly.

I’m curious if anyone here has experience using auto-investing in P2P lending. What has been your experience in terms of returns, risk management, and overall performance? Any thoughts on balancing risk and return when using such platforms?",0,2,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqcnct/is_autoinvesting_in_p2p_lending_a_viable_option/,new,Unknown,0.33

If such a scenario plays out, the market implications could be huge especially for energy.

Oil & Gas: Russia remains a major supplier globally despite sanctions. A credible peace push could ease fears of supply disruptions and potentially bring more Russian crude/natural gas back into legitimate global channels. On the flip side, if escalation happens before talks, we could see another spike in Brent/WTI.

Europe: European natural gas prices have been extremely sensitive to the war. A genuine move toward peace could stabilize or even depress prices, but if the path is rocky, volatility might remain high. LNG exporters in the U.S. (LNG, CQP) could be impacted if Europe shifts away from emergency buying.

Energy Stocks: Majors like XOM, CVX, Shell, BP might see headwinds if peace reduces the risk premium baked into energy markets. On the other hand, stability could boost refining margins and long-term demand planning.

Broader Commodities: If peace looks real, agricultural and fertilizer markets might calm (Ukraine/Russia being key wheat & potash exporters).

As an individual investor, this seems like a terrible return, especially when safer assets like government bonds sometimes offer even higher yields.



I've heard all the simple answers, but none of them seem to fully hold up. My doubts are:



\- The ""Spread"" Argument: People say banks profit on the spread between the interest they pay on deposits and the interest they earn on the loan. But I understand banks create money when they lend, not just lend out existing deposits. So why create money for a low-return mortgage instead of for something more profitable?



\- The ""Low-Risk"" Argument: The loan is secured by a house, making it low-risk. But there have been times when long-term government bonds were both safer and had a higher yield than mortgages. Yet banks kept issuing mortgages. This can't be the only reason.



\- The ""It's the Law"" Argument: The final answer I get is that banks are legally forbidden from creating money to buy bonds? Okay, but that feels like a circular argument. It doesn't explain why the entire financial and regulatory system is seemingly built to make mortgages the absolute best, most profitable thing a bank can do with its unique power to create credit???



I feel like the real answer involves something deeper. Can anyone explain the real, non-simplified rationale here?",191,391,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npzzyt/why_is_a_2_mortgage_a_great_business_for_a_bank/,new,Unknown,0.79

I know nothing about them other than reading the Ameritas literature.  Question for people who know about them: Is the cost worth it? Are their pitfalls that I need to know about?

I assume this is not adjusted gross income for income limit? I don't have social security wages, since I'm in a state pension system.

For high earners, will the Roth limit increase beyond the $8,600 for year 2026 for those 50yo+? For example, 50yo with earnings below $150,000 will have a Roth max of $8,600 (standard $7,500 + catchup $1,100), but higher earners will have a higher limit, because catchup contributions that were previously pretax get added?

1npncdh,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 16:38:02,Be careful with quantum stocks,"I'm an engineer, and my sphere of competence is technology. I'm a believer in quantum computers. Here's why I think it's a bad idea to invest in quantum stocks.

You see, a successful business is not determined by how advanced the technology is, but by its ability to generate a pile of money. Business, first of all, is a cash generator. And we, as investors, want to own great cash generators. The problem with quantum stocks is that none of them are great businesses (aside from maybe IBM and Google, which aren't really ""quantum stocks"").

Let's put aside the complexity of quantum computing and how difficult it is to scale. Let's assume we've solved all technical issues. Do you know how much it costs to build and maintain a quantum solution? Do you know how much it would cost to develop commercialized mass-manufacturing? To educate the personnel? The answer: a freaking unimaginable amount.
  
There's no company in Taiwan that will print you quantum chips on demand. There aren't millions of quantum engineers and software programmers waiting to be employed. The infrastructure does not exist. Quantum technology won't be scalable for decades - maybe half a century.
  
You can't even compare quantum to the AI revolution. AI is still silicon-based and can reuse existing infrastructure. Quantum technology reimagines our entire approach to computing from scratch. And it costs a hell of a lot of money (tons of debt, none of profit).

None of the companies on the market will dominate the quantum space. They're not businesses - they're research labs (and some are scams). The companies that will eventually build infrastructure, hire engineers, and scale to the market don't exist yet.

Technology doesn't mean business. Research doesn't mean cash. And sadly, even established companies with fully built infrastructure and strong brands can fail as businesses (sorry, Intel, I'm talking about you).

See how absurd it is that current quantum stocks already have billions in market cap, sitting alongside successful businesses? These companies print flashy news releases and talk big about how quantum will change everything. They exploit public ignorance about technology to sell wet dreams stuffed with money bags. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Your money will soon end up in the pockets of insiders and hedge funds.

This is a reality check not just for quantum stocks, but for tech hype in general. Think twice where you put your money. Maybe it's better to take your profit, consider yourself lucky, and buy your girlfriend flowers or a house?

Not investment advice, of course, but I'd rather put a smile on a girl's face than invest in quantum. ;)

P.S.
When in doubt, trust fundamentals, not your biases. Don't fool yourself into thinking you would've picked Nvidia in 2015 if you only had the information available in 2015. Today is the same - you don't know who's going to be the champ in 2035. It will surprise us all.

1npm4f4,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 15:50:49,Is Celestica (CLS) the quiet “picks & shovels” winner of the AI build-out?,"Seven weeks ago Celestica (CLS) hit the $253 price target I’d set. Since then, the stock has kept climbing, and, more importantly, the fundamentals have strengthened. This isn’t just another contract manufacturer anymore; it’s becoming one of the key suppliers enabling the AI infrastructure boom.



The CCS segment grew 28% y/y in Q2 2025. Its HPS revenue surged 82% y/y, lifting margins and returns. These numbers are being driven by the transition from 400G to 800G network switches, the high-speed plumbing that connects massive GPU clusters. Every major hyperscaler is now ramping 800G programs, and Celestica already has design wins for 1.6T switching racks scheduled to start in 2026.



You can add more GPUs to a cluster, but if the links between them are slow, training times don’t improve. Doubling network speed from 400G to 800G (and soon 1.6T) removes that bottleneck. Celestica spotted this shift early and is now one of the go-to suppliers for ultra-fast switches and racks.



The macro backdrop is also reinforcing the thesis. Nvidia and OpenAI just announced a plan to deploy 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA AI systems for OpenAI’s next-generation infrastructure and Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI to make it happen. Oracle has committed a staggering $300 billion to host OpenAI’s future workloads. All of that AI compute has to live somewhere, connected by somebody’s hardware. Celestica sits in the middle of that supply chain, quietly making the high-speed gear that keeps the AI arms race running.



I’ve raised my fair value estimate for Celestica to $320 per share, up from $253. That’s based on higher CCS growth assumptions (35% instead of 27% in 2025) and a slightly lower cost of capital as visibility and margins improve. The upside comes with risks (concentrated customers and potential capex pauses) but the long-term compounding story is intact.",15,8,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npm4f4/is_celestica_cls_the_quiet_picks_shovels_winner/,new,Unknown,0.69

Before, I was investing more unconventionally through real estate, but better late to the Roth retirement account then never.

I came up with a Roth IRA portfolio of: 50% VTI 20% VXUS 15% VGT and 15% QQQM.  

I've gotten some feedback from that post and have a new split of  50% SPMO 20% XMMO 15% VGT and 15% QQQM.  

Now I was looking for feedback on my brokerage account.  Currently it's comprised of individual stocks that I've just bought and been holding.  It's done quite well recently, up 110% since 2022 but I'm well aware that you could have pretty much picked any stock and made money the past few years.

  
So that leads me to this post, I want to add more stability and start reallocating and distributing my funds differently, mainly adding some ETFs to it.  So this is what I came up with to balance and not overlap the Roth.  

35% VTI 20% SMH 20% SCHD 15% ARKK and 10% to explore ie individual picks.

  
currently my 401k is primarily VOO.

1- Am I correct to have a sense of urgency not leaving this type of cash in 3.4% no penalty accessable anytime CD’s (despite the overvalued markets and anticipated crash) ? In CD’s I feel like I’m losing money every day - how fast should I act 

2- how would you diversify? Please note: with regards to physical gold/crypto I’m not there yet so looking for other options

3- I’m 46, and not yet ready for bonds

4- I am more a long term investor, I love the set it and forget it approach 

5- Another option is paying off my apartment or paying off some of it. It’s at 5.4% mortgage / had it for 4 years / $450k only out 10% down / it’s value dropped 15% since I bought it / I don’t like it and don’t intend to stay there long / some people talk about paying off mortgages or making extra payments > I know this is a predicament often discussed but maybe in my situation it could be a no brainer, what do you think?

I thought I had a good feel of the upward slope of the CAPE and how technology past 20 years might suggest a Shiller PE ratio of 40 might not be a sign of disaster in modern day.

Consider if you normalize the Shiller PE ratio to account for increases in productivity and the ""new normal"" for the level of earnings and productivity per unit capital.

If technology and productivity does not change over time, then Shiller PE graph might look flat, but obviously it is anything but flat for past 25 years.

My ""target"" Shiller PE is \~80 for 2026-2028, jumping to 300-1500 by 3032 depending on social and educational evolution being restructured by pressures from AI.

1nox5s0,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 19:43:46,Thoughts on my portfolio?,"
Thoughts on my portfolio? I’m just trying to grow my money. It’s not necessarily for retirement, but I do plan on just keeping it invested to grow for 5+ years probably so that it’s beating inflation and growing to some capacity where I don’t have to necessarily ever feel like I’m strapped for cash 

Investments into the brokerage account started a month ago. 

ETFs:
1) invested $178,765 into VOO between 576 to 606 price per share. 
* Current balance is about $187,730 with around 9k unrealized gain

2)invested $21,571 into QQQM at about $239 per share 
* Current balance is about $22740 with about $650 unrealized gain 

Individual stocks:
1) Invested about $5k in Google at around $190 a share 
* current balance is about $6500 with around $1500 unrealized gain 
2) Invested about $6300 into UNH between $275 and $300 a share
* current balance is about $7600 with about $1300 in gain 
3) invested $1k in Open Door to gamble a bit. I’m down like $300, since I entered last week and it’s been dipping. Shares bought in between 8.40 and 10.40 

Feedback is appreciated. I’m aware that I’m not very well diversified, esp in the international market as I have nothing for that. I also know that the mag 7 is driving up s&p 500, so I’m quite heavy in tech at this time

Should I rebalance, or does it like safe enough? I know past performance does not predict future too, meaning that international market could beat USA in the future and I’m heavy in U.S large cap right now. I guess I am in a way chasing performance, but I’m not sure if many people actually would criticize my selection or see it as fine. 

I’m looking to grow as aggressively as possible for the future without basically just gambling.

I can invest this money in exactly the same way as it is in my 401K and still earn this 15 or so percent each year.

Growth is slowing, job gains are slowing, and unemployment is creeping up. Overall, the economy isn't collapsing, but the party is undoubtedly winding down.



Inflation remains a concern. While below the nightmare scenario of 2022, it hasn't yet returned to the Fed's ""dream"" of a 2% target. Core inflation (sticky inflation) remains lingering. Think of it as a guest at a party that refuses to leave.



Interest rates: a little high, a little low. Powell called current rates ""modestly constrained."" In other words: they're not stifling the economy, but they're certainly hindering its rapid growth. The Fed has already cut rates slightly, but he made it clear that future rate cuts are not inevitable. The data will tell.



The risks are two-way. Cut rates too quickly? The inflation monster could reawaken. Keep rates too tight for too long? The job market will suffer. Powell essentially said, ""We're winging it, but we're doing it in a very professional way.""



Stocks are expensive. He actually said the market looks ""quite richly valued."" The Fed Chairman politely told us, “Yes, you paid a high price for those stocks.",326,140,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1noqbel/powell_spoke_today_heres_the_vibe_check/,new,Unknown,0.87

Key sentences: 

* ""Our vision is simple: we want to create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week.""
* ""... it will require innovation at every level of the stack, from chips to power to building to robotics.""
* ""We are particularly excited to build a lot of this in the US; right now, other countries are building things like chips fabs and new energy production much faster than we are, and we want to help turn that tide.""
* ""Over the next couple of months, we’ll be talking about some of our plans and the partners we are working with to make this a reality.""

Any guesses on who they'll partner with mainly? I'm not super into the end-to-end AI infra space but here's what our good friend ChatGPT says are the main areas:

* **Energy generation & supply:** To scale to gigawatt-per-week growth, you need lots of cheap, reliable, low-carbon or zero-carbon power. Also, grid/interconnection infrastructure must handle large loads.
* **Chips / accelerators / custom hardware:** GPUs, TPUs, ASICs, other accelerators for training & inference.
* **Data center / facility design:** Physical buildings, racks, layout, power distribution, mechanical infrastructure (cooling, ventilation), modularity, robotics for construction etc.
* **Cooling / thermal management & power delivery:**  GPUs and accelerators produce lots of heat; cooling strategies (air, liquid, immersion) become critical.
* **Networking & storage / I/O / data movement:** Training large models involves moving large volumes of data between storage, compute, between datacenters, etc. Inference also has latency requirements, so networking bandwidth, latency, storage speed matter.
* **Supply chain and manufacturing:** Everything needs to be manufactured at scale. Also packaging, testing, transport.
* **Software, orchestration, tools:** Software stack to manage hardware: scheduling of training/inference, utilization, monitoring, fault tolerance, optimizing for power, usage, etc. Also tools for model evaluation & selection, efficiency, etc.
* **Regulation, environment, sustainability:** Ensuring that scaling doesn’t blow up carbon emissions, water usage; environmental permitting; policy around energy usage; ensuring power grid stability; social/environmental impact of building huge facilities.

1noibvq,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 10:05:53,Transitioning our ROTH's from a managed brokerage (Ameriprise) to Fidelity...,"Hello all,

As the title says, I will be transitioning to Fidelity soon based on the advisor fees that I am currently paying. The wife and I set this account nearly 30 yrs ago at a time when we didn't know anything and the ability to trade and manage your money was a lot more cumbersome.  Over that time our two ROTHS have grown and are now at $500k (total)) which puts our yearly management fees at just under 5K.  I am kind of embarrassed that I let this go for so long but now I want to transition out of managed accounts and into something where we do all of the managing.

The funds within each of our current ROTH's have a decent mixture of bonds, REIT's and other assets but I feel that it could be better and now that I will be going to Fidelity, it opens up access to many more funds.  I'm looking for advise as to what those funds should be

Currently, each ROTH account contains - FEPIX, LLDYX, MXFIX, COST, MSFT, QQQ, SLV, IVE, IJH, ICF, IJR and VEU

Some more background might help as well -

The wife and I have 3 more years of work.. We have 75K in a HYSA and all our monthly expense, once we stop working at 60, will be covered by my military pension and disability rating. Our military health care covers us until we hit Medicare age. We also have (2) 401ks @ \~ 600k total so the ROTH money will remain largely untouched for at least the next 10-15 yrs.

Knowing all that, how do think I should set up the new ROTHs?

From what I've seen and heard, Nvidia is solidifying its position, and Oracle is becoming a huge player in the AI cloud.

1) The Nvidia-OpenAI deal is massive, with a commitment of up to $100 billion. It feels like Nvidia is locking in its biggest customer and ensuring its dominance.

2) The Nvidia-Intel partnership, with a $5 billion stock investment, seems like a smart way to de-risk Nvidia's supply chain and give Intel a direct line into the AI space.

3) I've also heard that Oracle is becoming a central player in the AI cloud, securing key contracts and positioning itself for massive growth.

All this new, energy-intensive infrastructure for ""AI factories"" is going to put a huge strain on global energy grids and supply chains. It feels like there are new investment opportunities and risks popping up everywhere.

1no8ea2,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 00:48:49,50RR Trade called out this weekend... Did you miss it? A perfect setup brought to you by Trend Analysis,"Hi all, Chartstradamus here.  I wanted to highlight a trade I called out both in this weekends update and yesterdays daily update. (For proof image 2, or my post history)

It is the 3rd of the 3 setups I trade, I've done some previous updates highlighting the other 2 over the past month.

This setup is a breakout strategy on the failure of an established trend.  On the break of the trend structure I will enter heavy on a retest and generally an impulse leg should bring us to the target zone of the over-riding trend.

For reference the Purple 15m bear structure was established and unchanged on my chart from middle of last week.  

The Blue 1H bull structure was established weeks ago and has remain unchanged as well.

The setup played out perfectly, with a clean test, break, and retest of the breakout line (circled in the 1st image) and a strong impulse toward the target area (the dotted blue line).

This is how good TA works, I am not necessarily predicting something is going to happen.  As I stated in yesterdays update I was actually short going into the day.  

I am just identifying inflection points in the market ahead of time, and depending how the market reacts to those areas plotting a trade from there. 

Wth extended targets and stops outside of structure that if they were to hit I would be sure of a directional change.

I'm up over 10k in profits more than doubling my account in under a month during this forward test. 

I hope some of you who have been following from the beginning were able to capitalize on this trade as well.  I appreciate all of you.

I have a 403(b) account through my old non-profit job called 'The Retirement Plan Company' or 'TRPC.' I started a new job a few months ago, and opted for their pension plan through WA state. My job also has a voluntary investment program through Fidelity that I can contribute to. I don't have much more money to invest outside of my pension right now, but I do have the option to contribute as little as $15/month to their Fidelity program (but I may be able to contribute more as time goes on). I have a separate Fidelity Go account with a little money in it for my daughter's college when she gets older too. 

My question is - should I rollover my TRPC 403(b) to my current employers Fidelity investment program and then contribute $15 a month?

Isn't this corroboration that workers with a paycheck got an 8% pay cut since Jan? Maybe that's a bit overstated, but it feels that way.

*Oklo Inc today holds a groundbreaking ceremony at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for its first Aurora powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”*

*“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.*

*The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.*

*“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”*",17,1,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1no05ld/oklo_breaks_ground_on_first_aurora_powerhouse/,new,Unknown,0.73

1nnytkk,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 17:14:33,My predictions for 2035 -what will be a goldmine and what will be a spectacular collapse,"
**1. Corporate jobs, white-collar, office jobs, working for corporations** -this has already been revealed as a scam career nobody thinks seriously about since how companies use AI to layoff people.

I would not invest my career path into being a cog in the corporate machine.
Layoffs, optimizing quarterly earnings by offshoring, and AI are taking over.
In my opinion, these jobs are too risky. The ultimate goal of corporations is to cut costs on employees, pay them as little as possible while keeping them from quitting, and maintain a constant large supply of workers (including migrants) to create endless competition and an employer’s market.

It’s very risky to invest in corporate jobs. I would stay away, even if today tech, finance, etc. offer good salarie because your job existence depends on whether the corporation wants you or not. It’s a pointless career in the era of AI.

**2. Independent career paths**

Jobs and professions where your clients are ordinary people and you control how much you work and who you work for. Dentists, nurses, hairdressers, car mechanics, builders, plumbers.
Services you provide directly to ordinary people, work independent from boss and managers.

**3. Small business owners**
Again, independent jobs outside the traditional 9-5 corporate slavery, without bullshit like time tracking and annual performance reviews. Local pizzerias, restaurants, beauty salons, electronic shops, food shops, etc.

**4. Marketing and influencing**

Having a large following userbase, being public and visible on the internet, building a community, being a YouTuber,  with 100k+ subscribers.
Why? Because it allows you to leverage that audience to create businesses you already have a ready user base.

**5. Innovations against capitalism and corporate culture**

Since the job market is terrible and will be even worse in the future, all innovation around fighting consumerism, anti-capitalism, and small alternatives (to McDonald’s, Amazon, Facebook etc.) will grow. 20 years ago, these companies were liked by people because they were innovative and helped improve people’s lives. Now they hoard all the profits for themselves and harm society, the economy, and the job market. People hate large companies now, and they will be seeking friendly, ethical, anticapitalistic alternatives who share profits with ordinary people and make their life better.

In the future, angry people who lost their jobs due to AI will also move away from large corporations. Just like iPhones will become outdated the way BlackBerry phones did, alternatives to Amazon and other corporate giants will emerge.

The next trend is anticonsumerism. All innovations that provide alternatives to AI, big corporations, and consumerism will grow. This is especially visible in Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Being poor and frugal will be cool. A few years ago, people admired influencers and celebrities now they hate them for flaunting luxury lives they’ll never have.

Previously, wearing Louis Vitton and rolex was considered impressive, but now people laugh at that. Wearing Temu clothes is seen as cooler because everyone knows buying overpriced products is for losers. Among the younger generation, wearing Louis vitton or riding a porsche isn’t a flex anymore, it’s cringe. People despise these status symbols, seeing them as losers tricked into buying overpriced corporate bullshit that’s worth $1 instead of the $10 000 they paid.

**6. Loneliness epidemic**

This is a huge problem. Right now people replace their social contact with tiktok and social media, but even though they use it, they still crave real human connections. Anything, businesses or innovations that solves this problem and unites the younger generation could be the next airbnb level innovation.

**7. Squeezing money from services for the middle class and rich**

All the work and services where the rich are consumers will provide a lot of money. Cleaning their houses, quality food for the wealthy, nannies, spas, luxury brands, etc. Prices for services targeting the rich will rise.
Just like corporations raise prices for products while cutting labor costs, people providing direct services for the rich (cleaning ladies, nannies, food delivery, spas, etc.) will raise their rates, squeezing money from the rich. People hate the rich and will overvalue these services as a way to get money back. 

**8. Investing in stocks**

I believe the UBI of our time will be investing in stocks guaranteed profit in the era of AI. On one hand, we can hate AI as corporate robbery used to lay off people. But on the other hand, we can ride the wave and invest in their stocks.

The recession isn’t coming in the next 10 years, corporations have everything in place now. The poor will struggle, but the capital market doesn’t care. Capital markets exist to make money.

Investing, especially in AI companies, is a safe bet. Ordinary people may dislike AI, but billionaires are already pouring money into it and will continue to. Large cap stocks at this point are like a safe UBI with 20-30% YoY gains.

What do the rich do if they want more money? They invest in stocks. Years ago, the stock market saw recessions, 20% drops, Black Mondays, banking crises, etc. Now the stock market doesn’t even react to that. The rich pour their money into stocks because they’re too lazy to create something new with real value they just click, buy stocks, and do nothing while their capital multiplies.

1nnyjfw,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 17:03:27,Should We Trust AI With Our Investments Researches?,"There has always been debate on how much trust to place in AI when it comes to investing. The benefits are easy to notice. It can process massive amounts of data faster than any individual, scanning price action, news, sentiment, and even onchain flows in real time. It also takes emotions out of the equation, offering signals that are more structured and less tied to fear or greed. For investors who want speed and efficiency, it feels like having an assistant that never sleeps.  
  
But there are also clear drawbacks. It is built on patterns and past data, which means it cannot fully predict sudden shocks, unexpected changes in sentiment, or events that can move markets overnight. It can also make traders overconfident if they begin to trust it too much, forgetting that markets are still shaped by human behavior and unpredictability. Another concern is that if too many people use similar tools, trades might become crowded, reducing the edge that individuals are looking for.  
  
These pros and cons make me think more carefully about how it could fit into my own investing approach. because I usually rely on bitget for my digital investments, but with the platform now upgraded into a Universal Exchange that combines crypto, futures, and even tokenized stocks in one place, the idea of using it there is becoming more tempting. I see how something like GetAgent could reduce the amount of manual research I do by pulling real-time prices, tracking smart money movements, and reading sentiment in one screen instead of many.  
  
The real question for me is whether I should actually bring it into my routine or just keep it as an optional tool. Should it remain a supportive layer in the background, or is it worth giving it a higher level of trust in making decisions? I have not yet committed to it because I want to weigh these points carefully.

I’m imagining a website or platform designed to surface, categorize, and showcase different types of investment funds in the same way Product Hunt highlights new products.

The idea would be to make discovery easier for both sides founders, startups, or even individuals looking for capital could browse funds in an open, transparent way instead of relying only on closed networks or word of mouth.

Ideally, these platforms would include smart filters and structured data:

Fund size / AUM range (small, mid, mega-funds)

Investment stage focus (pre-seed, venture, growth equity, hedge, private equity, etc.)

Minimum ticket size or check size (so you don’t waste time pitching if you’re way outside the band)

Investor types accepted (institutional only, HNW individuals, family offices, sovereign wealth, accredited retail, etc.)

Geographic focus (local, regional, global)

1nnti8f,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 13:53:39,Stocks is giving me a better return than crypto.,"I might receive a lot of hate for this but I sold all my crypto weeks ago, was holding cash collecting pennies on stable coins but now full ported into heavy tech, now up 13% in 3 mo, while BTC is slowly dropping and/or dead movement.  

I ditched ETFs a few days ago (SPY/QQQ) because those are safe options and I'm investing in tech with good growth and company financials / fundamentals. 

I've been in crypto since early 2017s and imo BTC isn't an investment anymore, rather a pump n dump. Big corp. has control over it now, the more they have invested the more they have control over it. I knew this in the back of my mind when government slowly took control. The more BTC rises the more money needs to pour into it to get a return. 

Alt coins give you a nice return but I don't want to put in the search effort that can potentially be a dead coin months later. 

Two of my friends in my discord also convinced me to pull from BTC, and there reasoning was, you need a lot of capital to make a % of what the returns were. 

Was also watching a podcast with tucker carlson and his guest said government and big corp want full control of BTC to pump and dump and use buyers liquidly to pay off national debt, take it with a gain of salt.

I looked up how much BTC does on year average says 20%ish - which is very good, except exchanges take a huge cut of your profits. Even had coinbase+ still was losing on it. Switched to kraken instead. During the bull run I made a decent amount then sold for profits but lowkey if I had NVDA/PLTR I would profit off growth/fundamentals instead of an ""agreement"". 

Lastly, my mentor himself who got me introduced to options even said he doesn't touch/hold BTC and hes been invested in the stock market for 10+yrs and made 10M+. 

Just my opinion would love peoples thoughts.

After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

1nnfyrl,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 03:24:22,Why EnSilica is Worth Possibly 13x its Current Price (Updated),"Okay, so you are probably thinking… yeah right, here’s that degenerate Double Bubbler banging on about that penny stock again. Well take a brief moment and read the following to see why my opinion is not so outlandish. You may one day thank me for it.

EnSilica develops custom semiconductor chips called ASICs. Essentially dedicated silicon expertly designed to a particular task such as providing encryption for Internet of Things devices, or efficiently moving data across satellite networks as will hopefully soon be the case with their custom ASIC for AST Space Mobile.

Recently MDA Space acquired a relatively low profile Israeli firm Satixfy for $280m in an all cash offer. Satixfy being a competitor to EnSilica in the ASIC marketplace and high growth satellite communications industry, with 2024 revenue of $20.6m. So that acquisition price is over 13x last year’s revenue!

Compare that with EnSilica’s forecast FY25 revenue (to be confirmed in results anticipated next month) of approximately $25m to $27m as well as a forecast FY26 revenue of between $44m and $47m with ‘80% of FY 2026 revenue already covered by existing customer contracts’ according to EnSilica’s trading update on the London Stock Exchange in April. *Please note I have used the current FX rate to convert figures that were originally quoted by EnSilica in GBP.*

Consider also that another competitor of EnSilica’s is Filtronic who have significant contracts with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Given the importance of Filtronic’s ASICs to SpaceX it has formed a strategic alliance with the firm and acquired 10,949,079 warrants - 5% of the current share capital of Filtronic - which would give SpaceX the opportunity to acquire a notable stake in the firm. Why would it want that? Well in my opinion to ensure they could have a say in the future direction of the firm as well as perhaps giving them the opportunity to create a defensive position to fend off hostile takeovers of Filtronic.

On the subject of Filtronic it is worth considering their forward price-to-sales ratio compared to EnSilica’s. EnSilica trades at a forward PS of just over 1.12 (against the low end of their current FY26 forecast) which compares to Filtronic‘s forward PS of 5.3 according to Simply Wall St data. If EnSilica achieves a similar forward PS as it approaches it’s anticipated medium term sales projection of c.£100 per year (hopefully together with a healthy profit margin) then you could see a market capitalisation of £500m+. That’s 13.44 times the current share price.

Who do I think are likely contenders to acquire EnSilica? Well Qualcomm could be a prime candidate in my opinion. Or another large and diversified semiconductor manufacturer that appreciates and can take advantage of the breadth of EnSilica’s IP, not just the sat comm work but including the post quantum encryption chip, optical networking design IP and automotive radar IP which is being developed in tandem with Radareye following funding from a consortium including Transport for London, IAG and Admiral.

Another possibility is AST Space Mobile, who EnSilica signed a contract with for a high value satellite ASIC in 2021 and which I understand will be a core component within AST’s BlueBird Block 2 satellite constellation scheduled for launch in the coming year or so. I consider AST a possibility as I wouldn’t be surprised that over time they broaden their offering to more fully compete with SpaceX’s Starlink (e.g. higher bandwidth satellite comms with guaranteed quality of service via terminal devices for static and mobile situations). EnSilica has a suite of IP for satellite terminals (a market which is worth billions of dollars) and owning that IP could help AST better compete with Starlink in that scenario.

I can also see U.S. and European companies such as Boeing, Airbus or Thales taking interest, especially given plans for the European Union’s forthcoming IRIS2 constellation. EnSilica’s IP and talent would seemingly be of great benefit to various industry titans in the satellite communications race that is heating up rapidly.

While I would like to see EnSilica grow to become a future British tech champion, I could understand the management accepting an offer of approximately 13x FY26 revenue. With a notable holding myself, I would not complain either.

While EnSilica’s share price fell last week, I still have immense conviction in this promising company and my recent discussion with Chairman Mark Hodgkins has only given me additional confidence in its future long term potential.

Yes, the share price may be turbulent in the times ahead however I may accumulate further should weakness persist (as I did last week) or following what I feel is an unlikely near term event, a rights issue, as is rumoured on ADVFN for example. 

EnSilica is a company I intend to hold for the years ahead given their apparent trajectory as well as potential for being acquired at a significant multiple to its current value.

Is This the End of the Road for AMD or a New Era of Competition?,"seismic event just happened in the semiconductor world, and it has major implications for investors. NVIDIA and Intel announced a historic collaboration, with NVIDIA investing $5 billion in Intel and forming a joint venture to co-develop new chips for AI and personal computing.

This partnership is a big deal because it brings together two of the biggest players in the industry, which immediately sent shockwaves through the market. While Intel's stock saw a massive jump of up to 30%, competitors like AMD saw their shares drop by over 9% in initial trading.

Analysts are now debating the long-term impact on the competitive landscape.

1) For AMD: The concern is that the new partnership could create a powerful, integrated offering that directly challenges AMD's products in both the data center and consumer markets. This move may put pressure on AMD to accelerate its own product launches and strategies.

2) For the Alliance: The deal could be seen as a way for Intel to get a much-needed lifeline and a direct path into the AI space, while NVIDIA gains a massive partner to expand its ecosystem.

What's your take? Is this the beginning of the end for AMD, or will this simply force them to innovate faster and make the market even more competitive?",148,105,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnf3pl/nvidia_and_intel_just_partnered_is_this_the_end/,new,Unknown,0.83

The dollar is under pressure, even as U.S. equities continue to rally. To me, the stock market’s strength looks like a mask, underneath there’s real anxiety about the direction of the world’s largest economy. Policy shifts, global uncertainty, and changing capital flows are all in play.

From my experience, when the dollar strains like this, it creates ripple effects:

Commodities often gain more attention.

Export-heavy companies can benefit while import-heavy ones feel the pain.

Investors start searching for hedges outside of the traditional stock-bond mix.

1nnd9am,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 00:40:08,Why Gold Is About to Take a S**t-Ton of Power From the US Dollar,"Source: Interesting video from Bravos Research https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_D5geZvfzs&t=1s&ab_channel=BravosResearch

In summary, they think the value of the US dollar is being repriced against gold, a trend that has happened twice before in history (1970-1980 and 1999-2011), when the dollar lost 90% of its purchasing power against gold. A rise in gold prices often coincides with systemic economic issues and a rising US unemployment rate because a weakening economy prompts the government to lower interest rates and increase spending, which makes the US dollar and Treasury bonds less attractive to investors.

While gold prices are currently rising, the unemployment rate is still low. This is attributed to three reasons:

1/Global Geopolitical Uncertainty: Governments and central banks are diversifying into gold as a safe-haven asset.

2/Devaluing Government Policies: The US government is running a large budget deficit, and the Federal Reserve has been cutting interest rates, which are policies that typically devalue the currency and lead investors to gold.

3/Anticipation of Future Recession: Gold's rise may be in anticipation of a future recession, as consumer confidence is low despite the low unemployment rate.

TLDR: Although stocks may continue to rise in the short term, gold is likely to continue outperforming them.

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley’s are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley’s. When economic conditions are rough, there’s not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn’t be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been heavily declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is “motorcycles are dangerous”. Anyone who rides motorcycles, knows someone who has been injured or killed on a bike. It is not very uncommon in the community.

6. The overall state of the market makes me nervous. Everything’s great until it isn’t and I want to have a hedge against a potential downturn in the market. I think this company would be more heavily affected than anything else I could choose from.

1nmnmh3,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 05:34:11,"Late cycle consumer spending shift = downside CMG, SG, etc?","
TL;DR: bearish Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen. Looking for suggestions on similar situations. The devaluation of fast casuals, lululemon feels like a symptom of shifting culture and consumer behaviour. Inflation, portion size shrinking, declining economic activity, consumer fatigue, non existent brand loyalty, and limited scope to rebrand, reinvent, optimize. Late-cycle cultural and consumer-spending shift, where former aspirational brands (fast casual, athleisure, boutique fitness, “accessible luxury”) have gone from status signifiers to punchlines.

Six years ago I visited a Lululemon store for the first time having been familiar with the brand for many years. I knew the brand as a high quality expensive semi boutique level product associated with Soul Cycle, Equinox etc. The store gave a different impression. Some of the clothes were wrinkled and badly presented, customer service was non existent, and they seemed to have no inventory. I assumed it was a one off bad example. But over the following six years I saw the same symptoms again and again and again. Meanwhile, other clues appeared: bigger and bigger sales discounts; diversification into non-sports products with no cohesive direction; a noticeable drop in quality of some garments (I’ve received a few Lululemon gifts down the years). Competitors with cheaper, equally good quality gear eating their market share. 


When I read about $LULU’s demise, I thought “oh course!” (hindsight’s easy, huh?) and began thinking who’s next? While already down bad this year, I can’t help shake the feeling Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen have much more downside risk. The traction gained by the “slop bowl” meme to describe their offerings feels like the Chipotle’s Mr Big dying on a Peloton bike moment. An increasing number of comedians joke about slop bowls and the term “slop bowl” has spiked to four times its previous highs on Google search trends this week. It sounds trivial, but this pervasive content influences our tastes, prompts us to take a look in the mirror at stuff we do on autopilot. I think small rallies / dead cat bounce short covering strength just offer nice entry position opportunities to get short.

With inflation rising sharply, portion sizes shrinking, declining quality of ingredients being masked with higher and higher salt content, these brands need to reinvent in other directions. Trouble is, I don’t know where they can turn. I don’t trust they do either. 

The 2010-19 period brought Netflix, Spotify, fast casual lunch spots with “healthy options” and “fresh ingredients”, it brought Equinox and Soul Cycle and F45 and Amex Platinum lounges to create the illusion for aspirational young professionals that they’ve made it to the top. That illusion is being dismantled. Costs are spiralling, fees are rising, and all these brands and business models feel tired and dare I say a bit embarrassing? These brands were once exciting and pleasing. Aspirational. Now, they feel tired and clichéd. Their complacency isn’t deserving of our money and I think they are heavily exposed to a new wave of disruptors over the coming years.

The 2010-19 era saw consumer spending shift away from luxury goods, cars, Electronics and refocus on travel, food, lifestyle. With more Americans owning passports than ever before and travelling to Europe in record numbers, it might sound silly to claim we’re at a turning point from experience-centric consumer spending, but I truly think we’ve reached saturation point in this cultural cycle. I suspect we’re seeing the beginning of the end of this cycle with no clear path to what the next looks like. 

One thing’s for sure: queueing up every day to buy $20 cardboard bowl of rice, cheese, soggy chicken, greens, some kind of flavored salty liquid labelled as dressing is an undignified experience we will come to laugh at in years to come.",18,6,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nmnmh3/late_cycle_consumer_spending_shift_downside_cmg/,new,Unknown,0.74

1nm58pv,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 14:09:53,Opening Discussion About RDDT,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.

1nm2vdm,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 12:36:20,$LENZ Therapeutics - VIZZ Eye drop relieves farsightedness for 10 hours and gives most users 20/20 vision.,"
Hello true to my name I have some DD on a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read??” Let’s bring those big Mr scientist science terms to reality.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. For those of you like me with an IQ below your waist size. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you. With Boomers refusing to retire they need this product like a fish needs water.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient that doesn’t effect the muscles around the eye but rather the dilation of the pupil. It creates a pinhole effect that increases vision up close. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•	Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•	Target population of the US is 128 million people - They are currently scaling up for distribution and plan to start full access in October. Few samples and marketing begins now.

	•	A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year.

	•	The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600 depending on many factors.

⸻

Company Financial Health: Strong

	•	Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•	Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•	This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•	They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•	They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•	It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•	The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•	Cramer likes the stock

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter. My position is small and speculative at about 1% my total net worth. However I plan to add more if good news keeps coming out about their scaling and distribution phase.",3,26,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nm2vdm/lenz_therapeutics_vizz_eye_drop_relieves/,new,Unknown,0.56

The original plan was to max out the Roths then the pre-tax, BUT we might have an opportunity to “retire” early (in our early 50s) and live abroad. The income gap to cover will be lower and so will health insurance and healthcare. We can do our traveling in our 50s and then move back in 7-10 years if we wish to. 

We will have our Roth contributions and probably rent from a property we will have managed while we are gone. However, we will also need 35k or so liquid in savings, and I’m trying to figure out the best taxable brokerage to use. Since this money won’t go to traditional retirement investments, where can we start parking savings and still get some growth? We bank and have a small investment account with So-Fi. Roths are with Edward Jones (I know, but my husband has the bigger one and likes talking to a guy and our 529 for our kid in college is there and mine could be moved). Vanguard? Another?

Every month we draw down our account to the 6 month emergency fund with 50% to VTI, 25% to an individual portfolio I manage with individual stocks of varying risk, and 25% straight to a second HYSA (separate from our emergency fund). The second HYSA is because my wife has 0 risk tolerance and I accept that knowing we have cash on the sidelines if there is a huge opportunity from a downturn. 

October is a 3 check month for both of us and my wife changed jobs so we will have a much larger surplus this month with her sign on bonus, PTO payout, and 2 additional pay checks.

Let’s say one of your holdings is doing really well, like skyrocketing. But of course, you know it can just as easily drop at the same rate. 

How do you decide if/when to sell and move it into something more stable? Or, do you just hold and say your prayers? 

The stock I am currently pondering is OKLO. It went up 28% yesterday, and all indications are that it will continue to grow now that there is all this attention on nuclear energy. But- nuclear stocks tend to be volatile depending on politics and current events. Not to mention the reality that as soon as anything goes wrong with nuclear production (meltdown, etc) it will likely tank the stock prices and be down a long time. 

Very curious what folks think. TIA. 

Link to OKLO’s site https://oklo.com/overview/default.aspx

*Edit: I’m returning a few days later to say thanks for the advice! I learned a lot. I ended up selling enough of my OKLO shares to cover my original investment and left the rest, am just gonna let it go for now and do what it will do. The intense fluctuations were stressful but now that it’s all just shares generated from profit I am less concerned. 

I’ve been looking into nuclear stocks that feel less risky and speculative. I went with Constellation Energy (CEG) and NuScale (SMR). Both are further along than OKLO, CEG is already building plants for Microsoft and SMR is a startup like OKLO but has federal regulatory approval.

1nltg3d,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 05:12:25,Plot Twist : Good ESG Companies Might Actually Trade Backwards in Emerging Markets,"You know how everyone says futures markets are supposed to lead spot prices because they're more efficient? Well, turns out that might be completely backwards for companies with strong ESG scores in India.

Think about it, if you're tracking a company with stellar environmental and governance practices, you'd expect the usual pattern where futures traders get the info first and spot prices follow. But a recent study analyzing 22 Indian companies across 11 sectors using daily price data shows the opposite happening. For high-ESG companies, the regular stock market is actually leading the futures market.

My take: This could mean one of two things, either the spot market has become incredibly efficient at pricing in ESG information, or there's something fundamentally different about how investors value sustainability in emerging markets compared to the West.

The really wild part? This pattern completely flips for companies with poor ESG scores, where futures do lead spot prices as expected. It's like there are two different pricing universes operating simultaneously.

This has practical implications if you're building ESG-focused portfolios in emerging markets, the traditional technical analysis playbook might not work the way you think.

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I’m doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I’ve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I’ve never had much of a strategy, I’ve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I’ve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in “core” growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in “moonshots” like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. 

The issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max. 

I struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I’m up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there. 

At the same time, it’s becoming almost impossible to manage 33 stocks at once effectively.

I think gold is the best investment in the current market climate with everything going on.

Gold's rise has been astounding recently. It has performed 33% YTD, 45% over the last year, and 80% over last 2 years.

Bull cases for Gold:

1. Rate cuts means more money will be pumped into economy. More money supply will only increase gold's value and devalue the dollar.
2. Current administration is trying to weaken the US Dollar which drives up asset prices, including gold.
3. Inflation remains elevated and current tariffs will only add fuel to inflation.
4. Uncertainty with governments globally are spending money on military.
5. Central banks buying up gold.
6. Central banks and investors have slowed purchasing of US treasuries signaling moving away from US assets.

Cons:
1. Gold does not generate income.
2. Possible that inflation does not accelerate.
3. Gold up already massively over the last 2 years. Investors may dump their profits and buy into other assets.


Maybe I am to much of a doomer millennial, but I don't see this stock market holding up in the medium term. Rate cuts will boost the stock market and we may have a minor pull back or two, but by the end of next year the bubble will deflate. Almost every stock metric is screaming overvalued.

And if the bubble does pop, where will people put their money? Are treasuries still the safe haven? Or has US Debt gotten too out of hand? Will more people pile into gold? Silver? Crypto? 

Anyway, just here for healthy discussion about the market outlook over the next year or two.",6,5,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nljtmn/gold_and_market_discussion/,new,Unknown,0.68

India's regulators just opened up REITs to retail investors and they're getting included in equity indices. This feels like one of those regulatory changes that could actually move the needle.

Context: REITs were mostly institutional before, now everyday investors can get in easier. Plus the equity index inclusion should improve liquidity significantly.

I'm curious about the timing - this comes right as we're seeing institutional money flow into affordable housing elsewhere (Brookfield's $10B+ manufactured housing deal in the U.S., for example).

I started investing 5 years ago. Im from hungary, so we have very good yield on government bonds. 6,5% for 3 years bond (this is for citizens only, not institutions).

I have a stock portfolio, which is performing very well. But I dont have an intention to increase it at the time.

Instead with my spare money I started flat flipping, my return on a flip is between 10 and 30% but realistically it will decrease to 10-12% net a year (market is changing).

My question is: what is your oppinion, it is worth to continue flipping for a 10-12% net percentage, or should I put in on bonds, the yield difference is only 3,5-5,5%. Which I know is significant, but bond require no work, flat flipping requires 20 hours a month.

So what so you think, the 3,5-5,5% is worth the 20 hours and headaches, or should I put this time to focus on other things, and just sit on bonds?

How often should I be checking up on the overall performance of the stock? For example, Invested in a quantum stock 2 days ago, was already up 7% and sold for profit. I'm not afraid of taxes as long as I'm making profit and reinvesting in other companies that are moving fast. 

Should I be checking them everyday, every week? I know trends move and money flows... I've been keeping tight numbers of whats doing good etc... I have long term investments and short term, but the short term is what I want to be watching. 

Saw a post somewhere that said 15% profit on stocks are a good exit? Obviously doing this comes risk of missing a potential runner like (PLTR,NVDA) if I were to find that startup company early and selling for a short gain.

To calculate how much retirement savings we will need to maintain a certain budget without our nest-egg ever going down requires some data.  I used to think my investments get a certain rate of return, then they will generate enough income to match or exceed my spending, but then I started thinking about inflation, and how that will impact the AMOUNT of money I need to maintain the lifestyle.

Is it accurate to say that if you subtract inflation from the rate of return, that the difference is sufficient for that calculation?

Example (with fake numbers).   If I wanted to retire with $50k of investment income, and didn't want to spend down my nest egg, I would only need to know two things.  How much savings and at what differential between returns and inflation?   If I wanted $50k, if I had a million dollars and returns were averaging 7%, inflation was averaging 3%, the differential would be 4%, I'd be getting $40k of income.   ($10k short of my goal, so I really need $1.25M)

As I type this, I think it's still wrong, because $40k today is worth more than $40k in 10 years, and it has more spending power now than it will then.

Brazil apparently also has something similar called Pix 

Apparently there's more similar systems popping up in many countries, both utilizing Central banks and operating via QR codes, independent of the american visa/mastercard payment networks, not only are they simple to use, they are purely digital and convenient. 

The most important evidence of their value though is the fact that Murica has attacked both systems, calling[ Qris a 'trade barrier](https://windonesia.com/article/us-cites-qris-as-trade-barrier-but-us-payment-model-unfit-for-indonesia)' or[ Pix 'unfair to Murican companies'](https://paymentexpert.com/2025/07/22/us-investigation-brazil-pix-payment-system/)

This to me signals that those systems are an active threat since after all, them taking over the market means American payment processors like Visa and mastercard will be losing a lot of power and relevance.

Not the investment in the co-ownership of luxury homes (their business model), but the investment in the company's class D shares which is currently open for all (apparently non accredited can buy as well)","To the uninitiated (as I was a couple of days before) - Their business is to offer co-ownership in luxury homes.  Co-ownership in 'home' seems like crazy concept to me (imagine the number of problems you would face in decision making!). 

But given this is a vacation/luxury home - whoever is buying these homes as fractional oowners must be doing it as an investment. Checked on trustpilot - overall owner rating seems high (but less number of reviews <200 - i guess that's because there can be only so many home owners/pacaso customers ?) .

Now to their Reg A class D shares offering -->

I saw their news (paid of course) on sites like morningbrew and likes. And since I searched for it afterwards, i now get to see lots of their ads too. 

 Some things I don't like is their PR. They will be like Pacaso secured Nasdaq symbol PCSO but they are not doing IPO. so why worry about getting a name ?? seems gimmicky. or maybe there is a reason.

This is their first public offering. So I am not sure if anyone heard or has invested in it (apparently 11K people so far have invested 55M + - no way to verify this claim apart from their website.

Their VC investors include top names - like Softbank vision fund. But i am wondering why these investor are not investing now and why is Pacaso instead doing a reg A instead and raising from people instead.

According to Empower, the 401k loan does not result in your funds being taken out of the market - it just adds the debt.

The 401(k) has super low fees (like 0.08%–0.16%). If I roll into Merrill’s inherited IRA, I feel like I’ll end up paying higher fees and service charges. At the same time, I get that an IRA might give me more control.

Has anyone else been through this? Did you leave it in the company 401(k) or switch to an inherited IRA (and if so, did you stick with Merrill or move to somewhere cheaper like Vanguard/Fidelity)? I just don’t want to get steered into something that’s worse for me long-term.

Currently, I am 57 and will stop working when I'm 60. I have two 401k's (one active and one from an old job) that should have a combined value of about 750k when I stop working.  I am looking at making things as easy as possible for my wife when I'm no longer around and while she currently doesn't take an very active role in our retirement planning that will change here in a couple years.

Right now the two 401ks have a variety of funds within them. The older one is a Gov TSP with C, S and I funds, while my active 401k is mainly Large Cap and Small/Mid Cap ETF's.  Do you think it would be ""easier"" for her in the future to have all our pre-tax money in a single account, spread across a couple stable ETF's vice how it is now?  Also, having never done anything like this before, is it a pretty simple process to transfer 401k balances into an IRA?   

Lastly, I assume that I cant simply bring over the same particular ETF's that I currently use since they are ""company managed"" (not sure if that's the correct terminology)  so would i just liquidate all the funds into cash and then transfer the balance into the IRA and go from there?

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story.

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.

I’ve googled them and I still just don’t understand how they work. It says they are due in December 2025 - what does that mean? 

She holds over 5500 of these notes and their current value is over £100. Surely that can’t mean they’re worth over £500k? I think I’m missing something key here. The interest she was receiving was about £600 twice a year.

1nk15dh,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 02:45:23,How to protect my mom from inflation?,"My mom is in her mid 60’s and is sitting on about $100k+\- usd from her inheritance. It’s all cashiers checks that she refuses to cash and deposit into the bank. Might be something left over from a divorce way back or bankruptcy. Either way, I’ve tried telling her that she’s lost nearly 10% of her cashes spending value this year alone. Invest in SOMETHING at least. She says, “ I need a place to live but I can’t afford one”. Boy will she be shocked when prices rise again and stay elevated… With the rate cuts current and planned, I can foresee even more sticky inflation in our futures. That being said, I’m a casual investor with only my limited experience these past 10yrs. 
My questions are as follows:

1- How do I effectively simplify and explain these current events and how they affect her and her savings. Now and in the future.

2-What is the general consensus on a relatively safe investment with liquidity in approx 2-5yrs? Normally in this situation with her age I wouldn’t recommend stocks. Too volatile even the “safer” bets to guarantee her investments safety in a time frame she could access it. Shoot I’m young enough I’d be riding this thing out but she’s not. Then there’s silver and gold. Both at almost all time highs. That was my first knee jerk reaction but again. Would hate to have her invest in a top of which I couldn’t help her with. Still, with inflationary pressures I think for it’s mobility and stability I think she should stack gold. If she’s not going to invest it through normal channels. 

My family historically hasn’t been the best with money/investments. Best bet would to find a good financial advisor but see previous sentence…I just worry that her fear of making a move will hurt her more than actually doing something to combat this.

1njurb9,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 21:03:54,Why Palantir (PLTR) Is a Strong Buy in 2025,"Palantir Technologies has been a standout performer in 2025, soaring significantly year-to-date on the strength of impressive earnings, AI-driven momentum, and major government contracts. Despite concerns about its high valuation, is this a tech bubble or a justified winner? The evidence suggests Palantir is capitalizing on AI with disciplined growth, profitability, and a strategic edge few competitors can match. Here's why Palantir is a strong buy for 2025, addressing bearish concerns and showing why they fall short.

Palantir's financials demonstrate a rare blend of rapid growth and profitability. First-quarter revenue showed strong year-over-year growth, followed by a record-breaking second quarter, particularly in the U.S. with commercial revenue surging. Full-year revenue for 2024 was robust, but 2025 is accelerating further. Unlike many high-growth tech firms, Palantir is profitable under standard accounting, with a notable net income increase in the second quarter and high operating margins. Cash flow is equally impressive, with significant free cash flow growth, far outpacing peers who often burn cash. Management has raised full-year revenue guidance, signaling confidence in sustained momentum. This combination of growth and financial discipline sets Palantir apart.

The core of Palantir's success lies in its AI Platform, which allows clients to run advanced AI models securely on private data, delivering insights for industries like supply chains, finance, healthcare, and defense. Strategic partnerships amplify this advantage. A groundbreaking collaboration with Microsoft integrates Azure's AI capabilities with Palantir's platform in classified defense environments, described by CTO Shyam Sankar as a major leap forward. Palantir also works with OpenAI and partners on responsible AI with Anthropic and Google. These partnerships are driving real contracts, such as deals with Fannie Mae for fraud detection, NATO for defense intelligence, and various U.S. federal agencies. Palantir's platforms, including Foundry for enterprises, Gotham for government, and Apollo for deployment, are proven and reliable. CEO Alex Karp is using AI internally to boost efficiency, aiming to multiply revenue with a lean workforce, showcasing a commitment to operational excellence.

Palantir's contract portfolio is a cornerstone of its strength, blending long-term government deals with a rapidly growing commercial business. A major U.S. Army agreement signed in mid-2025 consolidates numerous contracts into a multi-billion-dollar framework, praised by Army leadership as a step toward modernization. Additional defense and federal contracts, including classified programs, solidify Palantir's government presence. Meanwhile, U.S. commercial revenue is growing explosively, with a robust pipeline of high-value deals across finance, pharma, and energy sectors, where data security is critical. This balance of government and commercial contracts ensures a steady stream of recurring revenue.

Leadership is a key driver of Palantir's success. Alex Karp, with his bold vision of an AI-driven ""efficient revolution,"" is targeting massive revenue growth with a smaller team. The second quarter was described as phenomenal, with the company exceeding expectations and raising guidance. Founders and executives hold significant stakes, aligning with shareholders, and Karp's control allows a focus on long-term innovation over short-term market pressures. With a strong cash position and minimal debt, Palantir can fund research and weather market fluctuations, maintaining lean operations with high margins.

Compared to peers, Palantir shines. Against data and AI firms like Snowflake, Palantir combines faster growth with profitability, while Snowflake remains unprofitable. [C3.ai](http://C3.ai) shows promise but lacks Palantir's scale and margins. Traditional defense contractors dominate hardware, but Palantir's software and AI focus carves out a unique niche. Big Tech offers cloud services, but Palantir's specialized AI workflows, often in partnership with firms like Microsoft, fill a distinct gap. Karp argues that advanced AI models need Palantir to function effectively in real-world applications.

Skeptics raise valid points. Palantir's valuation, with high price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios, suggests risk if execution falters. However, its rapid growth, consistent outperformance, and major contracts support a premium. Government revenue concentration is a concern, but bipartisan support for AI and defense, along with multi-year deals, reduces risk, while commercial growth diversifies the business. International revenue has been flat, but Palantir's focus on the U.S. market is driving results, with global defense wins adding upside. AI hype could fade, but Palantir's practical applications, from logistics to fraud detection, and strong industry partnerships ensure staying power. Insider selling and Karp's unconventional style raise eyebrows, but significant founder ownership and a long-term focus outweigh these concerns.

Palantir is a leader in AI-driven analytics for critical applications, with strong growth, high margins, and a fortified position in government and enterprise markets. Karp's vision of efficiency is delivering, with quarterly revenue surpassing key milestones. Despite its rally, the market may underestimate Palantir's long-term contracts and commercial expansion. In a world where data is king, Palantir is a leading force. This is a strong buy for 2025.

WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - U.S. credit rating agency Moody's Ratings flagged several potential risks in Oracle Corp's [(ORCL.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ORCL.N) $300 billion of recently signed artificial intelligence contracts, but stopped short of taking ratings action against the software giant.

One of the main risks flagged by Moody's involved the ""counterparty risk"" of Oracle relying on large commitments from a small number of AI companies to fund its business model.""

Counterparty risk is always a key consideration in any type of project financing, particularly where there is a high reliance on revenue from a single counterparty,"" Moody's analysts wrote on Wednesday.""And in our view, Oracle’s data center build is effectively one of, if not the world’s largest, project financing,"" they added.

The analysts further noted the company will see its debt increase faster than its EBITDA, which will contribute to a forecast high leverage of 4x before Oracle's EBITDA begins to outpace its debt.""It is likely that free cash flow will also be negative for an extended period before reaching breakeven,"" the analysts wrote.

Oracle had a Moody's issuer rating of Baa2, which is at the lower end of investment-grade credit ratings.

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (LXRX) is currently trading around **$1.08**, and from what I’m seeing, it looks like they might finally be getting their act together. Here’s a quick breakdown:

* **Pipeline & Partnerships:** Their experimental obesity drug (LX9851) has a **partnership with Novo Nordisk** worth up to **$1 billion in milestone payments** with $75M upfront. That’s a huge vote of confidence from a major pharma player.
* **Products Ready for Market:** They still have sotagliflozin (INPEFA®) for heart failure and other metabolic disease candidates. They’ve trimmed commercial operations to focus on **R&D and licensing**, which could mean they’re gearing up to push their promising products to market more efficiently.
* **Price Action:** At $1.08, the stock seems **relatively stable**, suggesting accumulation. For a biotech that’s had its ups and downs, this could be a **setup for a breakout** if upcoming approvals or partnerships play out.
* **Upside Potential:** Analysts have a 12-month price target of **$3.23 on average**, with a range as high as $6.00. If even some of their pipeline works out, that’s a **lot of upside** from the current price.
* **Risks:** Of course, **biotech is always high risk**. Clinical trial outcomes, FDA approvals, or delays could still negatively impact the stock. But with the Novo Nordisk deal and streamlined operations, they seem to have **more runway and credibility** than before.

**So, anyone see a reason not to buy at this level?** Could LXRX be the under-the-radar biotech that finally delivers for investors, or is it still too early to tell?",0,22,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njrayk/lxrx_at_108_is_there_a_reason_not_to_buy/,new,Unknown,0.33

Fed governor Stephen Miran preferred to cut rates by a half a percentage point and disagreed with the quarter percentage cut.

The Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point with a landslide 11-to-1 vote, setting the target range between 4% and 4.25%.  The 1 vote dissented from Miran, favoring a larger 50-basis-point cut instead.

The **decision of a 25 BP cut** was based mainly on the following:

* **Labor market concerns** with recent job gains have slowed significantly, and the unemployment rate has edged up.
* **Economic slowdown** with indicators suggests economic activity grew at a more moderate pace in the first half of the year.
* **Acknowledged inflation** remains somewhat elevated, but the Fed judged that the rising downside risks to employment warranted a rate cut.

1njhk2x,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 12:15:53,"I usually don’t sell this fast, but after a 57% gain in 5 months in Oil-Dri (ODC) I closed the position. The company’s great, the quarter was record-breaking, but the risk/reward isn’t as compelling. What do you think? Anyone looked at ODC before?","I wanted to share something unusual for me. I tend to hold winners for a long time, but I just closed a position in ODC after a 57% gain in five months (bought at \~$43, sold at $68).

Back in April I did a deep dive on ODC and called it a “quiet compounder” hiding in plain sight ([here](https://www.beatingthetide.com/p/george-atuan-the-dirt-on-a-quiet-compounder-hiding?utm_source=publication-search)). This is the company behind Cat’s Pride litter and a whole bunch of industrial clays. It owns its own clay mines and makes everything from lightweight cat litter to filtration clays used in renewable diesel. 

My thesis then was simple: vertical integration + shift into higher-margin products = rising profitability, but the market hadn’t caught on. 

Earnings had tripled in a few years and the stock was still at single-digit P/E and EV/EBITDA. 

I valued it at $64.

Fast-forward to today. ODC's last earnings were one of the strongest quarters in its 85-year history: Q3 FY2025 revenue $115.5M (+8% y/y), net income $11.6M (+50%), EPS +51%. 

The B2B segment (agricultural carriers + renewable diesel filtration) delivered record sales and margins over 30%. Even with some hiccups in retail cat litter, the overall business is firing on all cylinders.

**B2B Products Group**: Sales +18% to $42.7M, op income +26% to $13.4M (\~31% margin). Ag products hit an all-time high (+43%) as customers worked through last year’s inventories. Fluid purification clays +13% y/y. Even though US renewable diesel production was down 12% early in 2025, ODC’s sales into that sector were up, they’re winning share at new plants. Amlan animal health stayed flat at $5.8M but management is tweaking distribution.

**Retail & Wholesale**: $72.8M sales (+3% y/y) but excluding the Ultra Pet acquisition organic sales were down \~4%. Clay litter fell 6% due to a lost private-label account and some retailer bankruptcies (think regional pet stores closing). Competitors got aggressive on promos. The bright spot is lightweight litter and crystal litter: Cat’s Pride Fresh & Light and the new Cat’s Pride-branded crystals are growing faster than the category. Ultra Pet added \~$4.8M in Q3 sales and ODC has increased the number of retail “doors” for its crystal litter significantly.

Financially, ODC is conservative: cash $36.5M, net debt essentially zero. They’re doubling capex to $32M/year to modernize plants and meet demand. Dividend up 16% (22nd consecutive annual raise). Management thinks in decades, not quarters. The CEO literally said they plan 40 years ahead for raw material reserves.

Industry trends still support them: cat litter demand projected to grow \~5% annually through 2030 with premium subcategories like lightweight and crystals growing faster; renewable diesel capacity in the US keeps expanding and every gallon needs filtration clay; agriculture inputs stable to positive as farm supply inventories normalize.

So why sell? Valuation. 

The “steal” at $43 has been recognized. Multiples moved from <8x earnings to \~13x, EV/EBITDA from <8x to \~11x, P/FCF from 18x to 25x. My updated fair value is $74, so there’s still some upside (\~8%), but the asymmetric risk/reward I look for is gone. I’d rather redeploy the capital into the next underpriced idea than sit on a position where the margin of safety has shrunk.

I’m still a fan of the company and it stays on my watchlist. If Mr. Market throws a tantrum and ODC dips again, I’ll be ready. But for now, discipline > emotion.

Curious what the sub thinks: do you trim or exit when a small-cap rerates quickly? Anyone else follow ODC or other under-the-radar compounders like this?

I’m concerned that all of these assets look pretty overbought at the moment but the plan is to hold this allocation for a decade.

**Question #1:** What would make more sense:

\- To diversify with gold as a hedge, or 

\- To diversify with a world index ETF to balance exposure across regions and sectors. or 

\- To add more into the QQQ

1njdniq,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 09:48:00,Bubble worries have sparked my interest in a particular bond ETF,"I do not believe in timing the market, but when there are major economic trends brewing, I do try to position myself to take advantage of them, which is why I'm plowing a big chunk of my portfolio into TLT right now.

TLT is an ETF for 20+ year bonds. It has a decent yield, but more importantly, it is very sensitive to interest rate changes. The moves can be pretty dramatic. It's down about 50% since the days of ZIRP. You don't usually think about capital gains when investing in bonds, but TLT is uniquely positioned for gains if the Fed continues to reduce rates.

My thesis for this investment is that we are either stuck in stagflation or we are on the verge of a recession. If we're in stagflation, the yield from TLT will outperform the S&P 500. If we're in a recession, the fed will likely continue to lower interest rates, and TLT will deliver capital gains on top of a yield.

The obvious risk is that we are actually entering a period of sticky inflation and the job market recovers, in which case the Fed will raise interest rates. But this seems like the least likely scenario. Tariffs are expected to create transitory inflation and everywhere you turn there is weak jobs data.

I’ve been following ACHR for almost a year, but I haven’t added more shares recently because the stock seems a bit volatile despite all the developments.

I’ve done a lot of DD on them and I like their tech and long term vision, but some circumstances have changed over the past few months that make me cautious.

They’re making moves into the defense and military space, with partnerships like Anduril, trademarks like Monarch, Giraffa, and Mothra & property acquisitions near defense partners. They’re also set for upcoming events like the Dubai AirShow and potential operations in Abu Dhabi. These moves could create serious upside if executed well

https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/archer-aviation-inc-achr-a-bull-case-theory-4-1606309/

The main issues are that they’ve missed earnings ($0.36 loss vs expected $0.24), and insiders have been selling significant shares recently. That always raises a red flag, even if it’s not a dealbreaker.

The stock’s trajectory is still promising, but progress has been slower than some expected. Their tech is solid, and the military angle could be a game-changer, but execution risk is real and timelines aren’t guaranteed.

We are currently just over five years into it.  The two are valued at $2.2M and we owe around $1M.

1niqq2t,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 15:10:53,Rate my collapse portfolio,"I have a feeling my portfolio is going to make a lot of people mad, but am curious for feedback.

I’ve historically (35 years in 401k) been a pretty modest but aggressive investor, only tweaking my mix every 2-3 years.  At the end of 2024 I moved most of my balance into a self-directed PCRA and into safer investments (mostly international bonds and international index funds).  I shifted a bit more into stocks and precious metals in April and am up about 12% overall YTD.

I’m also a big believer in climate change and in the science behind [The Limits to Growth](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2023-08-14/which-future/), and all the recent science indicates we’re now experiencing climate change at an exponential rate, which will continue to accelerate.  I think that in the next 5-10 years it will be impossible for people to deny, although some will choose to think of it as biblical end times.  Add in all the predictions of a big economic downturn, I’m ready to lock in on a longer term strategy.  

I’m not savvy enough to know if it’s going to be a recession, depression, stagflation or hyperinflation scenario, but it seems like the Permanent Portfolio strategy has consistently outperformed other portfolios in these types of conditions:

* 25% bonds
* 25% stocks
* 25% cash
* 25% gold

Given my long term outlook for societal collapse by \~2040 (give or take 5 years), and the limitations associated with an employer sponsored account, here are the modifications I’ve made:

**25% bonds (+ bond proxies)**

* 10% in ISGH
* 10% in XLU
* 5% in FPI 

I’m betting on utilities to do well with the change to regs around exporting natural gas, and increasing scarcity in general.  I’d like to be more heavily into farmland, but not super comfortable with any of the REIT’s right now to commit more.

**25% stocks**

* 11% in VYMI & IEUR index funds
* 11% in “collapse” stocks
* 3% in my unicorn stock, ASTS

Collapse stocks include companies in agriscience, fertilizer, firefighting chemicals, air conditioner manufacturers, and some Trump admin-inspired stocks like COIN (holding) and PLTR (just unloaded).  I would love to diversify more in this category, open to suggestions.

**25% cash / 25% gold**

* 10% in a 4% CD, which would cover 8-10 mos of expenses
* 15% in physical gold and silver, the remainder of liquid assets
* 25% in gold and precious metals ETF’s

I will purchase more physical gold/silver and reallocate the funds in ETF’s as able.  My goal is to maintain purchasing power as things continue to unravel.  

Anyone thinking along the same lines?  For those who think my outlook is crazy, how do you think this mix will perform?

1nih5qo,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 09:14:19,Defying the news: why do prices sometimes move in the opposite direction of the data?,"Sometimes, a much anticipated new release comes out, and the prices go the exact opposite way than you’d expect. 

Today, US Core Retail Sales for August came in at +0.7% MoM - much better than the expected. Logically, stronger consumer spending signals a robust economy, which should boost the USD and in turn push EUR/USD lower.

But this didn’t happen, at least at the time of writing. EUR/USD is still pushing higher, at 1.18100 and testing multi-year highs. 

Why does this happen?

Here are a few key reasons:

- Buy the rumour, sell the news: Markets often price in expectations before the data hits. Traders anticipated solid retail numbers amid ongoing economic optimism, so the ""good"" news was already baked in. Once confirmed, profit-taking kicks in, reversing the trend.

- Overriding Factors: This one is vital to understand: even strong data can get overshadowed by bigger fundamental stories. Right now, the USD is under pressure from expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, and this dilutes the USD appeal.

- Technicals and Sentiment: Charts matter. EUR/USD has been in a bullish channel, with support at 1.1760 holding firm. Also, broader risk-on sentiment can trump a single US bit of good news.

- Not All Beats Are Equal: If the data ""beat"" isn't massive, it might not shift the narrative as we may expect. A 0.3% surprise here wasn't enough to derail the dovish Fed story or the general USD down sentiment. 

This is the market's way of reminding us: it's not just about the data released – it's about context and the bigger picture. 

The only remedy: an open mind ready for any outcome, and sound risk management.

But I have a contrarian view. Their recent promo 25for25 on the surface may seem like a short term money grabber. But it might be a key to long term sustainability/growth. Those of you not familiar with this promo, just take a look at r/jetblue among other flyer forums and you will be surprised how many people are doing it. The gist of the promo is that you fly to 25 destinations by the end of the year and you get x amount of their mileage points and a status with them for next 25 years. Directly, B6 may lose some money on these flyers (the points one earns roughly offset the amount one spends to acquire them). But imagine this. A person who is sitting on these points, and has a status with the airline, is going to do anything in his/her power to fly with them... for next 25 years. Not just them, their companions who may or may not have the status will likely fly with them too. So, I think it may be the thing that helps JetBlue survive. Third and fourth quarter earnings will give us some data to prove/disprove this theory. Thoughts?

On one side, there's great excitement for AI that drives company values up. It resembles a gold rush, as everyone believes they've discovered the next big thing. At the same time, bond yields are rising, which typically makes investors more careful and can cause them to withdraw money from the stock market. This creates a strange mix of optimism and caution.

This situation raises the classic question: is this a true tech revolution or just a bubble waiting to burst? I find that the real challenge of holding these stocks is the wild fluctuations. One day you’re significantly up, and the next you’re down just as much. It's not suitable for the faint of heart.

To handle this kind of volatility, perhaps the strategy isn't to chase the latest trend but to think long-term and diversify. It might be better to find companies that genuinely use AI to address problems, rather than simply riding the hype.

* [**VXUS**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/vxus/) (30%)

I've considered adding **value**, specifically small-cap value, and **momentum** tilt to my portfolio. Here is my plan:

* **US vs. Non-US** = 60:40
* **Market cap weight (MCW) vs. Factors** = 75:25
* **Value vs. Momentum** = 60:40

I've also been studying most ETFs' methodology, and I like Avantis and Alpha Architect. Here are what I plan to add:

* [**AVUV**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/avuv/): Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF
* [**AVDV**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/avdv/): Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF
* [**QMOM**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/qmom/): Alpha Architect U.S. Quantitative Momentum ETF
* [**IMOM**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/imom/): Alpha Architect International Quantitative Momentum ETF

Here is what my equity portfolio would look like with the tilt:

* VTI = 45%
* AVUV = 9%
* QMOM = 6%
* VXUS = 30%
* AVDV = 6%
* IMOM = 4%

Besides the increased rebalancing difficulties and management fee of this new plan, my biggest concern is how much time I need to commit to it. Both [Rick Ferri](https://youtu.be/e7_MFyltNt4?t=415) and Wes Gray agreed that a tilted portfolio may require 25 years of commitment, due to its tracking error. However, in studies, value and momentum have a strong negative correlation, so when both are together, they should help smooth out the performance.

I believe in factor premiums, and I'm confident with this plan. My most considerable doubt is the long-term commitment, which I can't guarantee due to my health condition. My kids may inherit my portfolio once I'm gone, and I assume they might prefer to see some evidence to trust this plan.

I'm looking forward to hearing some feedback about my new portfolio, especially if you have also looked into factor tilting before or have already added one or two factors to your portfolio.

Hey guys I'm 19, started investing this year I have 8k invested. I did my first year of university but I want to switch my major and drop out of my current university. If I drop out right now I'd only get a 50% refund from my school meaning I need to pay around 1.7k And Id need to pay my 5k loan back on top of that (if I don't drop out I don't need to pay that loan back for another 2 years) 

I have no idea what major id switch to but I didn't do grade 12 math cause I didn't need it for the major I'm currently in. This worries me because idk if I'll be able to get into another program and I might need to go to college instead or redo whatever Highschool courses I need to do. 

I was thinking that if I can just find a part time job and drop out of school I'll be able to afford to lose that 6.7k. But I feel like finding a part time job will be insanely hard and probably unlikely due to job shortage.

The thought I have in my head is to just work as much as I can, pay for school after the gap year and invest the rest of the money. I have no expenses since I am lucky enough to live with my parents. 

I have the idea in my head that you can become financially free by just working maybe even average paying job and putting 90% of the salary into investing until my compounding interest is more than my yearly contributions, then buy a small affordable apartment and eventually upgrade to something else and perhaps rent it out for extra income. 

Any tips? Is it unrealistic? Can you get financially free with any job? 

For some reason I'm really worried about my future and confused on what I want to do, but I do know that I want to invest as much money as I can.

* Weak job data has increased expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, which Wall Street anticipates will boost corporate profits and stock values
* Bond markets have strengthened as traders price in rate cuts, with * Treasury yields falling to multi-year lows
* AI industry growth continues driving market gains, with nine of the top 10 most valuable stocks involved in AI representing 40% of total market value
* Trump's tariff policies have provided some business certainty after months of uncertainty, though they're contributing to inflation
* Consumer spending remains resilient, rising 0.5% in July and supporting economic activity
* Risk factors include historically high stock valuations, mounting consumer debt, rising delinquencies, and inflation concerns pushing gold to record highs near $3,700
* Some executives worry tariffs pose greater threats than anticipated, with potential to eliminate competitors and worsen inflation more than rate cuts can help",721,342,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ni6kr5/article_why_are_stocks_setting_records_when_the/,new,Unknown,0.91

That will mean that the odds of a fed rate cut have gone up. Even though the Trump loss on the firing of Cook means that she won't be sidelined, there was really no indication of how she would have voted. On the other hand Miran's opinions on the matter are pretty clear, even if one doesn't think he is a trump lackey. 

However, in both the shorter term and the longer term, it's not clear how things will work out. If the Trump supreme court upholds his right to fire at will which it has done in all the other cases, then he will still be able to stack the deck in short order. (and maybe intimidate the other governors). Whether this will stimulate the markets because of the short term effects of a cut, or in fact result in a pause, as they accept the pprobability of higher inflation in the long term remains to be seen.

Have seen people with way more performance, but overall I've remained in the green (except for a few big downturns).

I reached out to both advisors (partners) in May to invest the cash reserve part of my portfolio (16% is cash - and I wanted to invest about half of that), and they didn't respond and I forgot about. Now I see that practically any investment at that point would had have quite a few gains now. Google was 180, now 250 for example - one of the stocks I would have added. 

At a later date I asked them to sell Vital Farms stock (had a lot of gains in that one) and trade it for Google. They suggested to wait until earnings, and then sell.  After earnings, it Vital climbed to $50 and Google was at 200. Earnings came and went, and they didn't make that trade! Vital Farms is pretty much flat or lower now.

I understand brokers work to balance portfolios, and I do give mine the agency needed to make trades without contacting me for each and every one. However, I find this infuriating, seeing the gains that would have been made. On the flip side, I do see that there could have been losses / or it could remain flat as well, but I wanted to take my gains and move into another company that I see a lot of potential in.

1ni0ifz,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 18:40:04,I just had a fascinating conversation about US exceptionalism vis a vis our shift to 401k versus pensions,"This is going to be long and only for the hardcore investment nerds I think. I asked a question, namely, ""does the consistent, robotic, unemotional influx of money from US retirement investors (buying pressure) have a stabilizing effect on the US market and does it contribute to US exceptionalism. The answer is a resounding ""yes"" it would seem. 

1. The US market holds the largest share of investors on the planet. Over 50% of the entire globe's investors are US investors, representing trillions of dollars.

2. As a result, these steady, cyclical drips into the US markets (home bias: most US investors invest in US companies) provide a stabilizing effect on domestic stocks. Even in down markets, there is a constant drip-feed of millions buying stocks undriven by emotion. 

3. This constant, drip-fed influx of money (regardless of market conditions) provides US companies with an advantage in the form of cheap capital, that is then used for R&D, only further ensuring that US products and companies recieve the highest level of innovation

4. This entire dynamic contributes to a de facto ""moat"" around the US market allowing to better weather troughs in the economic cycle, and maintain an innovation advantage over international competitors, increasing US market performance. 

It made me realize that because of our shift from defined pensions (in the 80s) to defined contributions in individual stock portfolios was a ""happy accident"" of sorts when the first 401k was dreamt up in 1979. By adopting the 401k (or similar) as the de facto retirement vehicle for people, we also managed to create a ""self feeding beast"" of sorts in the US market. This machine-like drip feed of funds is a major factor in what we call US exceptionalism, and it more than likely will help perpetuate it going forward.

1nhy2zb,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 17:02:24,Arguments for and against international diversification,"I am currently in the process of reweighting and simplifying my portfolio. Around 85% of my holdings are in the USA, with 15% in developed international.

As of late, I have been considering reweighting this and potentially adding in emerging market exposure.

The US has outperformed international for some time now. I can see some reasons to believe that American Exceptionalism could continue.

1. Many American brands have a very high prestige around the world and can eat into international market share
2. Some American companies have a technological edge which will attract business from around the globe
3. The US has a very business-friendly climate and regulatory structure.
4. I see storm clouds on the horizon for many developed international markets, namely the birth rate crisis, sovereign debt issues, and business-hostile climate. Emerging markets similarly have their own problems, namely political risk, and environmental/climate issues.

However I can also see some basic arguments in favor of diversification:

1. Sure the US has outperformed in recent memory but that may be all the more reason for international stocks with more reasonable P/E ratios to outperform, moving forward.
2. The de-dollarization process has begun. [Foreign central banks now hold more Gold reserves than Treasuries for the first time in 30 years](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzrOr3jXEAA7pGm?format=jpg&name=medium) and the USA more generally is exhibiting signs of emerging market behavior. Rising populism from both parties, the erosion of Federal Reserve independence, a new push for more direct federal government management of the economy (tariffs, Intel, etc.), and the potential of monetizing the national debt all introduce a new set of risks and challenges for the US market.
3. Even with immigration, the US is not immune to the demographic problems plaguing the rest of the developed world. US deaths are expected to outpace births by 2031. Emerging markets have growing populations who are becoming educated and plugged into the internet at a breakneck pace.

Bryce C. Tingle, business law prof at U. of Calgary, writes;

> Over the past 30 years, the number of companies that sell shares on markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq has fallen by roughly 50 percent.  ... I have spent more than a decade trying to understand what is going on, and I have come to believe that the culprit is public company governance, the system in which many different groups, all pursuing their own agendas, generate rules for how public companies ought to be managed. These rules, norms and regulations — which tackle such issues as who gets to be a director, how executives should be paid, in what ways companies ought to respond to climate change — are constantly accruing and building on one another until this obscure process generates towering structures that, like a great coral reef, can tear out the bottom of a boat. 

> From 2000 to 2020, only about 10 percent of a thousand successful venture-capital-backed companies chose to go public.

Does this mean that regular investors are fighting for the scraps, leading to a bubble in the highly valued tech stocks that are publicly traded?

Google AI tells me that US private companies are worth $14T, vs $63T public market cap.  But if this $14T is concentrated in novel tech, it's significant.  On the other hand,  most private cap companies are small.  On the third hand, it's likely comparatively little value resides in the long tail of small companies, just like the SP500.   For example, Anthropic is estimated to be worth $180B, and that's from a funding round, which I would think prices it conservatively.


Counterargument: if there's a bubble in AI and other tech, and you have a successful private company, it makes sense to go public and exploit that bubble by selling shares to a starving market.  Then again, it might make more sense to sell it when it's bigger, so the little guys don't get the benefit of the first phases of expansion.",77,33,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nhtsh0/nyt_fewer_companies_going_public_because_of/,new,Unknown,0.79

Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is possibly easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read?” I was just like you when I first read that. Here is what I learned.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•Target population of the US is 128 million people

	•A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year

	•The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600

⸻

Company Financial Health: Good

	•Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

Major Risks to Consider:

	•They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•I am unable to determine if their creation of this drug is protected by some type of IP or patent

	•It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•Financial health could be pressured if they fail to scale in an economical way

	•Short Interest is 30% – it is irrelevant to my thesis on this product but something you should all be aware of

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter.

I’ve been looking into silver recently as a potential investment, and I’m curious what the community thinks.

On one hand, it seems like silver has some solid fundamentals:

* It’s both a precious metal and an industrial metal (used in electronics, solar panels, medical tech, etc.).
* Historically, it’s seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.
* Compared to gold, it looks relatively undervalued right now.

On the other hand:

* Silver can be extremely volatile, sometimes even more than gold.
* Industrial demand could fluctuate depending on the economy.
* It doesn’t provide dividends or yield, so holding it is a pure bet on price appreciation.

I’m wondering: do you guys think silver is a smart play right now? Would you go for physical silver (coins, bars), ETFs, mining stocks, or avoid it altogether?",8,43,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nhmcfe/thinking_about_investing_in_silver_whats_your_take/,new,Unknown,0.67

IT & industrials
Even if AI will eventually flop, it's still going. However, with Mag7 valuations and EPS projections being far from perfect, I prefer looking at those who sell timber and iron to the shovel makers: COMM, STRL etc. 

Aerospace&Defense look really good considering ongoing conflicts and lack of tariff exposure.

Great sectors overall, but picking is a key. 

Comms
They are beating expectations harder what tech. Some great regional diversification, too, with VEON or IHS.


Materials
Despite a bull market, gold skyrocketed. Most of gold diggers though are still priced like an ounce is worth $2k, despite their margins are wide af. And with growing inflation, crappy bond yields, and high uncertainty, it's hard to imagine what could go wrong for gold. It's literally almost impossible to pick a bad stock there, an average gold stock has made 70% over a year. 


Financials
Banks should benefit from the falling interest rates. BNPL should benefit from this and reducing in consumer buying power. 


Energy
Nuclear is overbought, and oil seems to be on the downward trend, nothing to fish here. 


Consumer Staples
Not a bad choice with purchase power dropping. I really like CALM, for instance


Consumer Discretionary
Not sure I get a point why invest into them. Tech/Comms/Industrials will do better in a bull market, and this sector will be hurt just as much in the bear market. 


Utilities
Kinda same as with energy, I don't see green to be taking cash. I do like SBS though. Maybe hidden tech stocks like VTOL


Healthcare
I don't believe in biotech at large, but some pragmatic things like hospitals or telemedicine could be great


REIT
Nah, not with BBB :)

I felt I would quit job in first few years and open a business but never materialized, so I kept living life on autopilot, just doing 9-5. In covid, i started taking interest watching lot of news about stock rocketing. I opened brokerage account and started investing, in doing so sold my employer RSU feeling it'll drop but it only double after I sold. Then to catch up for time lost, I taking big bets, invested 700k in various stocks and SPUS, but in August 2024 when trump announced tarriffs, lost 10% and panicked and sold losing 70k in cash. Then again mustered courage, and invested in Feb 2025, again tarriffs were announced, lost 20k. Then have been away from market ever since.

I also bought house all cash in 2023, as felt i have so much cash why should I do mortgage (also am against borrowing money on interest), but sadly house didn't appreciated, I bought in Austin, rather price dropped from price I bought. I feel as much I chase for parking money watching everyone multiply their savings, more I'm losing money. Till date not only I have lost appreciation by not investing in SP500 over years but have lot 90k in cash value of money and some 10ks of dollars in house. I am not complaining as I'm lucky to earn this but also wish to earn passive income or see appreciation so can save money for my family. I see people who don't have passive income or savings invested have to work till late age in life even if they don't like it.

How do I start now, SP500 has been breaking record every other week for last few months. But with global events unfolding every week, if I put my entire life savings into them, how do I navigate if a recession hits?

1nh8zz6,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 21:37:53,Housing Market to Crash?  …It’s Complicated.,"Since 2021, I’ve been hearing a lot of talk on a housing market bubble. 

I’m here to say, with incredible confidence, that I’m actually not confident about where housing prices will find themselves in the coming years…at all. BUT I don’t think this disqualifies me from offering some insight for you other brave souls to carry the torch where I’ve stumbled in the dark. 

I built two important models, today, both of which can completely justify the median home price at current interest rates… and argue against it entirely. 

The current market prices seem “allowable” if I’m allowed to assume that the market projects a rate fall from the 6s to the low 3s. Then it makes sense. 
Let’s start with the home values current. Some estimates put median home prices for 2025 around 410k and other are as high as 440k.  I believe Zillow has a figure around 380k. So, for all intents and purposes, I like 410k. 

Whether or not these prices are deeply overpriced really come down to just what the average interest rates should look like over the next 30 years from here. And I did a little ‘mathing’ to prove that.

I regressed the monthly payment per square footage of median-priced homes over the last 30 years. This model assumes a 10% down payment, then incorporates average interest rates of each period to derive monthly payment.. then divides by square footage of median sized home in each year (took forever to find). 

From that trend line, we can see that the market mean for 2025 would have the payment per square ft at 72 cents. 
Converting that into a monthly payment brings us to around $1600/ month for principal and interest. 

All the to say the trend from 1995 to 2025 would reasonably have someone pay that. Given today’s interest rates, that would then price the projected home value for 2025 around 290-300k. 
Now that’s not the national average, is it? 
No. Absolutely not. Should we be upset? Well, hang on..

Here’s why that figure still might be a gross underestimation of how the market ‘should’ price homes: 
It doesn’t factor in the potential for refinancing. 

If the market broadly accepts interest rates to hover around 6-6.5% for the next 30 years, then we would probably see homes take on lower prices. But we haven’t. So somewhere baked in, there must be a presumption of what long term interest will look like moving forward. 

So, I started playing around with the figures and reset the objective of finding what interest rate the market would imply, assuming that the home prices today are priced perfect. 
So I plugged in the median home price today (410k) combined with the market’s regression of monthly payments (normalized to square footage) and got back 3.22%…ish. 

The question from here is, which idea sounds crazier? 
Is it crazier to think interest rates moving outward will effectively be around 3.22%, or is it crazier to think that homes are selling for a 40-45% premium? 

In one world, interest rates would have to be cut in half in the next few years and in another world housing prices would have to either stagnate for a decade or fall by 30% in the next year. 


Now, I understand no model is perfect, and mine is really not factoring in any nuances experienced in this year vs any other, but it certainly stands on principle. That principle is “Something has to give”.

So, what do you think? Are we in a bubble? Have prices climbed with inflation? Can we reasonably expect lower interest rates? Can we expect a major correction?

1ngal7f,2025-09-13,2025-09-13 18:25:40,AMZN covered calls free money?!,"We have some vested AMZN RSUs that have been pretty stagnant but I’m bullish on the company and we’re plenty diversified so we’re holding. 




About a month ago I was reading some covered call strategies and AMZN stood out as a decent company to sell covered calls on. So I tried it weekly for the last month, on Friday I’d sell a CC for the next Friday from $130-248 each. After rolling the cost and putting aside some money for the tax man I came out with about $440. That’s just under 2% return for the month. 



If I do this every month and let the cash sit in a money market or reinvest I come out with a pretty healthy profit. Now I just have the 100 shares so it is a bit of effort for just $440/mn but we have more vesting soon and once we get 200-300 shares that’s not bad. 




Here’s where it’s free money:


1. I’ll get this out of the way: I’m completely fine if these get called and I have to sell. It’s been an underperformed and was “free” to begin with. I’m not expecting amzn to have a crazy week and I miss out on a double. 




2. I’ve been selling 232.5 and 235 calls. Amazon has struggled to pass the $240 and only a few times in the last year did it get to $235+ making it fairly unlikely for it then to be called.



3. AMZN shouldn’t have many unexpected upside moves, it’s just not historically likely. Making it somewhat safe. However it does tend to float between $215-230 meaning this should be a fairly sustainable approach for me to keep doing every week or two.




I’m not sure if I’m missing something obvious? Like the biggest risks are losing out on future gains of the shares if it gets called and taxes right? But the taxes are factored in and the return is still decent and the future gains I’m just not particularly worried about and it seems I’d be able to buy back in. I’m genuinely open to advice if I’m fucking something up, but I don’t think I am and it seems like a solid strategy.

August deliveries were \~40 % down YoY. 2nd quarter results were not as bad as that, but still nothing good. The deliveries for Q2 were only \~2% higher YoY. 4.5 % declined revenue, net income essentially flat.

However, they guided for Q3 deliveries and revenue to decline \~40% YoY!

Finally, their upcoming models don't bode very well, IMO. Their BEV models don't look very interesting aesthetically--in fact, kind of ugly. The upcoming i6 seems to look alright but nothing special. I'm not seeing how they're going to compete well in the extremely competitive Chinese market if Chinese consumers continue shifting to BEVs, and that's the area that Li Auto seems least competitive in. They achieved a lot of growth on hybrids, but their BEV models have been relatively unsuccessful so far. But the future lies in EVs, I think. I don't see how Li's competitiveness is going to improve with boring-looking cars, when Chinese consumers have so many other options to find good value propositions.

So, I don't get it. Why has this stock not collapsed more? It's trading at about the same price as at the end of April. At that time it was delivering \~35k vehicles/month, compared to \~28k in August.

Li Auto themselves predict that their next quarter will be terrible, with 40% YoY declines in deliveries and revenue.

Over the last few decades where the assumption was generally “dollar strong, don’t want foreign currencies dropping to eat the returns of dollars invested internationally” those hedges were essentially a form of downside insurance for exchange rates wiping out returns “from the dollar perspective.”

I admit to a lot of ignorance about how the funds actually implement hedging strategies, but are they bi directional or are they just implemented to insure against downside currency risk from the dollar perspective?  That is, if an international bond paying interest in Euros is hedged now and the dollar is falling, does the hedging effectively make performance worse from the dollar perspective?

1nfwv0f,2025-09-13,2025-09-13 08:58:13,Your sustainable fund might not be what you think it is,"A massive academic review of sustainable investing research uncovered something concerning: recent studies show many funds labeled as ""sustainable"" or ""ESG"" actually contain companies with significant ESG controversies.

The research analyzed nearly 1,000 papers spanning 35 years and found that while sustainable investing exploded after 2015, the methods for screening companies remain surprisingly primitive. Most research relies on backward-looking data rather than predictive analysis, and there's virtually no use of modern technology to detect or prevent greenwashing.

This matters for individual investors because you might think you're investing ethically while inadvertently funding practices you oppose. The fund labels and ESG ratings we rely on appear to have significant blind spots.

The study suggests we're in the early stages of sustainable investing - like the dial-up era of ESG. The infrastructure for truly effective sustainable screening is still being built.

If you're investing in ESG funds, this research suggests doing additional due diligence beyond just trusting the label or rating. The field is evolving rapidly, but current methods may not be as reliable as they appear.

1nf46bi,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 10:06:01,Is Oracle just SoftBank wearing a mask?,"Let me get this straight:

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?

Can I contribute $23,500+25% of my income? I will make roughly $23,500, let's make the math easy: Can I contribute up to $29,375?

I am a freelancer. This is the first year it's been my only income. I have no savings option other than my Schwab acct so I want to dump the max I can into this Solo 401k.

1nejleo,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 16:25:59,Thoughts on ANGX (Angel Studios) as a Long-Term Play?,"As a few of you know, angel Studios, a streaming company went live on the stock market today.

I’ve been digging into ANGX (Angel Studios) now that it’s newly public, and I’m curious what others think about this one in its early days.

A few things caught my attention:

In less than a year, Angel Studios grew its Guild membership from 600,000 to 1.5 million.

That kind of subscriber growth feels exponential and, in some ways, comparable to Netflix in its early expansion phase.

The company already has a proven track record of producing surprise hits (e.g. Sound of Freedom, homestead and others), and if they can keep scaling content and membership, the upside could be massive.

I’m not saying this is a guaranteed rocket ship. nothing is, but if Angel continues on this trajectory, it could be a 10× in the next decade or two. Some even think it could become one of those rare 100× companies, but obviously that’s speculation.

Right now, I’m mainly shooting for the 10× potential and want to hear what others think:

Do you see ANGX as a serious long-term hold?

Is anyone else planning to buy in or build a position and just let it ride for years?

Or do you think the hype fades and the business model isn’t sustainable at scale?

Would love to hear different takes especially from those who invest in high-growth, early-stage public companies.",12,33,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nejleo/thoughts_on_angx_angel_studios_as_a_longterm_play/,new,Unknown,0.78

I’ve been pretty skeptical about Oracle’s surge, but they are about to recognize a lot of revenues. This market reaction is interesting because so far, the “big AI” bets were companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, Google, Meta, Broadcom, etc. Oracle, by contrast, has long been seen as more of a legacy play, focused on infrastructure for large enterprises.

What we’re seeing is that investors still go crazy for AI, especially when an established, “old guard” player gets involved. Is this an overreaction? Hard to say. Ideally, markets should value not just AI mentions and vision, but the actual value being unlocked. Maybe that’s exactly what’s being priced in here or maybe it’s an over- or underreaction, since we still don’t fully understand what AI will ultimately deliver.

Ofc there is lot more to Oracle than this but still im very curiousy

I'm thinking of re-allocating my portfolio so that more of the cash is kept within tax advantaged accounts - specifically my Roth IRA - as otherwise taxes eat away at the interest (I'm in a high bracket).

* Buy $10,000 VTI in Brokerage.
* Sell $10,000 VTI in Roth
* Buy $10,000 T-Bill in Roth.

Downsides are that I probably lose a buck or two to the bid ask spread.

1lw0ltf,2025-07-09,2025-07-09 21:46:40,Today I made $1m gains by selling my entire Nvidia portfolio,"Today marks perhaps my greatest investing milestone of all time!  The short story is I bought $36,000 worth of Nvidia over the course of 8 years. Last year I told myself once my account breaks $1m profit, I will sell the entire position, lock in the gains, and have a hell of a story to share for life.  Well today Nvidia hit a new all time high and I made that dream come true.

Below is a long version of how it all came to be: 

I first acquired Nvidia back in Feb 2017 and in a few lump sum purchases wound up with a total of 6,500 shares of NVDA.  My first purchase was for 1080 (in honor of my GTX 1080 I bought that year) and the share price at the time was a whopping $2.77!  My total investment around this time was $4000.  

Edit: I looked up the actual purchase numbers and the number of shares was actually 27 at $110 but since Nvidia had split multiple times, the number shown in my report today was reflecting those splits.  End of edit 

Back in 2017 all the talk was about Crypto mining and I naively thought Nvidia was the way Bitcoin would be mined forever so I bought into the mantra “during a gold rush, buy the company selling the shovels”.  This was around the time BTC hit $20,000 for the first time but it quickly collapsed and I was introduced into the volatility of the crypto world.  But I still held my Nvidia because I believed crypto was still at an early adoption stage.  

Over the next few years I continued to buy small amounts of Nvidia, in chunks of 100 shares here, 900 shares here, and eventually had 6,000 shares by 2019.  The average cost of all of these were around $2-$8 in today’s value.  

2019 is a significant milestone for me because I made a major life decision to move to Puerto Rico.  This move was made for several reasons but one consideration is the 0% tax on capital gains from stock sales.  I didn’t consider Nvidia being the one stock to move for but one reason for selling the whole lot was to lock in the 0% capital gains today 

I remember somewhere around 2019-2020 starting to think that GPUs and Nvidia specifically weren’t going to be tied to crypto as much as it would be the hardware needed to power self driving cars.  The hype around Tesla was growing and crypto mining started moving away from personal computers and I learned GPUs were falling out of favor for more powerful ASIC mining rigs.  So my mentality moved from Crypto to Electric Vehicles.  Keep in mind, I really didn’t know a lot about any of this and I view my Nvidia convictions at the time more as luck looking back.  

Then in 2020 the Pandemic hit and we saw major sales of GPUs for gaming, virtual reality, and supply chain disruption and of course massive inflation.  Stocks across the board were super volatile but in general things went bonkers in the tech sector.  Tesla was killing it and Nvidia might have doubled during this time.  It still had not gone parabolic yet but I still just kept holding onto my initial position.  My portfolio wasn’t really moving in any major way yet and in early 2019 I was actually slightly negative in my total Nvidia investment.  

Then in 2023 we saw the first mainstream use cases for Ai started popping up.  I’m in the photography and videography world so I noticed how disruptive image and video creation would be as soon as it hit.  All my colleagues were making images in Midjourney when the majority of my non photo friends had no clue what Ai image generation even was.  It ballooned quickly and that’s when my mind set changed a third time. Now Nvidia was going to be needed for data centers and personal computers to power this new Ai revolution.  It wasn’t about crypto or self driving cars anymore, it was about perhaps the biggest innovation humanity has seen since the internet was launched and the iPhone was revealed.  

Seemingly overnight my portfolio was sky rocking.  Where just a few years prior, Nvidia was in the red for me, it quickly started carving out a large portion of my portfolio.  Once a liability, Nvidia now made up 10%, 20%, and 30% of my entire investment account and retirement funds.  There were days when I would log in to see I had made $100,000 that day and a week later it would swing down -$105,000.  It was pretty crazy to see a full year’s worth of income bouncing around day by day in my account.  The temptation to sell had always been there since 2017 when I was up 20-100% but now I was up 4,000% and the temptation was even greater.  Every single one of my friends was telling me I had to take profits off the table.  I wound up holding.  

The last major purchase I made was in July 2021. I bought 400 shares for $14 which at the time was 3-5x what I had bought previously.  

Jump to June 2024 when Nvidia hit an all time high of $130.  My wife and I had just had our first child and my Nvidia position was hovering around $800,000 in total gains.  I knew I only had to make it to $160 per share to break the $1m mark and I told myself I would sell everything if that happened.  Of course the next month Nvidia corrected pretty hard and the reality of hitting $160 didn’t seem possible until July 3rd 2025, nearly a year after I made my original decision to sell.  

I should have sold everything on July 3rd but I didn’t realize the trading day was shortened for the 4th of July holiday coming up. I also didn’t setup any automated sell triggers since I wanted to ceremoniously do the trade myself.  It worked out in my favor as I was able to sell today at $163 and make a little more than the $1m cutoff I originally set to sell at. 

Here are the raw numbers:

Total invested: $36,352
Total sale: $1,059,591
Total gains: $1,023,238
Average cost per share: $5.60
Time to materialize: 8 years and a lot of emotional rollercoasters!


I know a lot of people get caught up in fancy investment options that feels more like gambling but hopefully this success story inspires those of you who are like me and just what to buy shares, hold them, and eventually offload them when the time seems right.

Apparently, that wasn't low enough as it's now been revised down to 2.8% decline.

6 weeks to swing from 2.9% growth to 2.8% contraction.  That's a crazy level of slow down in the economy under this Administration in such little time.

It's such a bad economic forecast that the Commerce Department is wanting to hide the number by changing the way GDP is calculated. That's like North Korea or Russia just making up economic numbers. What in the world is happening here??

95 years ago the US levied the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, worldwide tariffs that were designed to encourage domestic production and punish ""cheating countries"". This kicked off a trade war that had no small part in causing a world-wide depression. 

The US has not levied global tariffs of this degree since then. Until yesterday.

What happened to US equities?  After a roaring bull run during which wealth was printed and the every-day man flung money in the market it crashed. But not overnight. In fits and starts the DJI lost 90% of its value over a 3 year period. 

It took *25* years for it to return to an ATH. 

Trump has fired 10s of thousands of federal employees. He's spiking unemployment. He's taxing imports to the tune of 50-100%. Other countries will do the same to us. Our companies will start having mass layoffs, crushing economic activity and investment. Domestic production will not return, everyone one will be out of money to buy stuff anyways. The SH tariffs did nothing to encourage domestic manufacturing, it just made everyone poorer. 

Maybe our monetary policy will prevent a Great Depression and we escape with ""only"" 8-10 percent unemployment, mild stagflation and the market takes 3-5 years to recover after a 50% fall.

""Canada has frozen $43 million in payments to Tesla pending a line-by-line investigation into its last-minute surge in EV rebate claims made on the final weekend of the government program.

The American EV maker run by U.S. presidential adviser Elon Musk will also be excluded from all future EV rebate programs as long as tariffs are in place, former transport minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.

The stop-payment order appears to have been made before the current election was called Sunday, though Freeland only confirmed it Tuesday, while on the campaign trail for her University—Rosedale seat.

“As soon as I became Transport Minister, I asked the department to stop all payments for Tesla vehicles in order to fully examine each claim individually and determine whether all are eligible and valid. No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid,” she said in a statement texted to the Star.

“I also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentive programs so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.”""

1jq4hf3,2025-04-02,2025-04-02 20:28:52,US Senate passed bill by slim margin in a 51-48 vote to block Trump's tariffs on imports from Canada,"4 Republicans cross the floor to vote with Democrats to pass a bill that would remove import tariffs on Canadian goods.

This still needs to pass the house (which has republican majority), and even if it passes the house, president can still veto. At which point it goes back to the senate and 2/3 need to vote to overturn the veto.

Low chance, but indication that dissent is happening within party lines given the economic downturn of tariff policy.

Interesting to see how many more house reps and senators break from party lines after today's ""liberation"" tariffs have time to impact markets and consumer prices

Trade war is on!,"Canada is imposing it’s own 25 per cent tariffs on $155 billion worth of U.S. goods after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped Canada with 25 per cent tariffs on all goods and 10 per cent tariffs on oil, natural gas and electricity.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the tariffs will take effect on $30 billion worth of goods starting Tuesday with a further $125 billion worth of products being taxed 21 days later.

Trudeau elected to go ahead with retaliatory tariffs even though Trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if Canada retaliates against the U.S.

Canada will also look at how to limit export of rare minerals to the US which are crucial for US tech companies.

What does this have to do with investing? There are a handful or so of REE projects in various stages that could be killer investments in the coming months or years. ASM in Australia, LEM (of which I am invested) and SCD in Canada, as well as a few projects in north, central and south, America who's names escape me. The various Greenland REE projects are also possible punts that might be good for a bubble play, but they have major hurdles to economic production, more so than the others IMHOP.  Most of the REE projects around the world have major hurdles but that's just where the industry is. 

Either way, outside of investing in the REE space, these recent export controls could affects dozens of global industries that affect our everyday lives so watch this space particularly.

Bitcoin has been popular for 15 years, but it still doesn’t seem to have a mainstream, everyday use. You can’t just walk into most stores and buy groceries or gas with it. Yet, every time it surges, people start calling it ""the future of finance,"" but that future never really happens.

I keep hearing about institutional money coming in, but if it’s mostly hedge funds and whales pushing the price up, how does that make it a real currency? If regular people are just there to provide liquidity for the big dogs, how is this different from a glorified pump-and-dump?

Don't get me wrong I'm a Bitcoin fan and have been buying and selling it for years now. But I cringe everytime I hear “It’s digital gold”.. Gold has a use beyond its speculative value. It can be made into jewelry, art.. People want to have it because its a ‘real’ thing you can hold in your hands! Bitcoin's only real use is making anonymous transactions that regular humans don't usually need to make.

Am I missing something here, or is Bitcoin actually just a bigger fool scheme?

Edit: When you ask the trading AI everyone on tiktok uses ([this one](http://trademind.ca))  It basically says Bitcoin isn’t a Ponzi because there’s no central scammer, no guaranteed payouts, and it still functions even when prices crash. It’s more like a scarce digital asset that people trade, kind of like gold but way more volatile. But that still doesn’t really answer why it hasn’t become a real mainstream currency.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

**These stocks are expected to be impacted because was reported 2 hours ago that there's enough Republicans that have crossed the floor to work with Dems on a tariff removal resolution (just for Canada, not for the Liberation Day international tariffs)**

\- Democrat Senator Tim Kaine has launched a resolution in the US senate to reverse tariffs on Canadian imports to the US. It's co-sponsored by Senators Amy Klobuchar and Rand Paul.

\- To pass all Democrat senators need to support it, with support from 4 Republican senators. Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins have voiced concerns with tariffs and are expected to support the resolution which would help it pass. Decision was expected either yesterday or today.

**Note**

\- This is not a political post, it makes no comment of if tariffs are good or bad, or if one party is better than the other.

\- The only thing this talks about is a new devolpment that enough senators across both parties may pass an economic policy reversal

\- This was first reported 2 hours ago, and was not previously posted

\- It is relevant to stocks and investing, as the economic outlook for many US/Canada listed stocks will change if tariffs are removed.

So here’s what I learned from him.

**Gov support**

-The local government is helping and giving him low interest rate loans / short term financial support. This type of thing is very common throughout China right now - lots of local govs are mobilizing to support exporters thru the tariff war. Li Qiang, central gov minister, says central government help is probably coming too 

-Guangzhou, and I assume others too, has also organized tons of seminars since Liberation Day with buyers from Europe, Latin America, and Asia. A big source of replacement demand for his factory has been from these

-He’s getting lots of buyers from TikTok shops overseas. It seems like TikTok is helping a lot to mitigate the demand impact 

-The news story of Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. resuming some orders is true, he confirmed it. But the amounts are **very, very** small

**Pain**

-He’s already re-evaluating employees and firing some soon. He said most exporters in Guangzhou are cutting some employees, but extremely US dependent exporters have furloughed most of their workforces until mid May

**Some good news for the U.S?**

-Before Liberation Day he was building a factory in the US and has now fully committed to it. But it’s having issues since the raw materials are sourced from China and they’re getting hit with tariffs

[The full interview is here](https://www.yaphete.com/p/live-from-the-trade-war-2-chinas), I didn’t write everything here.

1gegwdy,2024-10-28,2024-10-28 19:46:22,"69 YO sister was sold $2M in deferred annuities, left with only $200K in checking account","My sister was sold about $2 in annuities by her bank.  She told them she wanted to invest in something that guarantees no loss of principle.  So they sold her $1.2M in 5.15% annuities and $800K in 3% annuities.

She has a mortgage at 2.75 that she pays to the bank with $10,000 monthly mortgage payment on a $1.1M loan.

After fees the 3% annuities pay less than the mortgage.  They tell me it's so she can deduct the mortgage interest.

I was made trustee on her accounts and was pretty shocked.  Her expenses are about $50K a month and they wrapped up 90% of her money that she can't touch for 3-5 years.   She invests exclusively at this bank so they knew her finances.

The good news is that her salary covers the $50K a month, barely.  
She sold her company for a $5M stock merger but can not sell the stock for 2 years.  
Her home equity is about $2M

The bad news is that she has FTD (Frontal Temporal Dementia), hence the trustee bit.  
The really bad news is that she has 3-5 years to live.  And how much longer she can work

I feel like the bank took advantage of he by tying up 90% of her cash.   Her net worth is around $10M so she now has about 2% of her money that she can access.

The bank won't break the annuities unless she pays the penalty.  I'm pretty pissed at the bank and have told them that their investments ""Were not in her clients best interest.""  She lives in California and the attorney general's page talks about selling financial instruments to people over 65.  It's considered 'elder abuse' if they are not working in the clients best interest.

If you're thinking about selling your investments after a minor drop in the market, then you really need to adjust your strategy. Maybe consider a money market fund or speaking to a financial advisor.

Everyone seems to have forgotten the risk that comes with investing. We have seen gains in the last few years that are unlikely to be repeated in the near future. There have been past periods where the market has been down over a significant number of years.

If you have time on your side and are diversified in index/mutual funds then you need to stay the course. If you have all of your money in a few individual tech stocks then you need to restrategize or stop complaining when you lose a significant amount of money.

1jpgecv,2025-04-02,2025-04-02 00:33:57,"US tourism officials sound alarm, tourist flights to US sink 70% and could impact up to 140k hospitality jobs and $14B in economic spending","Here is my way of trying to find alpha in an erratic stock market - how I'm trading the US tourism dip.

**1. Canada is the US's largest source of tourism**: In 2024, 20 million Canadian tourists visited the US, spent $20.5 billion, and supported 140,000 US jobs. Canada's population is 40 million, so 50% of the entire country visited, and the US had 77 million tourists so 1 country is contributing 26% of visits.

**2. Recent US policies is leading to a tourism boycott from Canadians, and the rest of the world**: Tourists are boycotting US tourism due to tariffs, annexation threats, new travel barriers, and stories of visitors being unlawfully detained with no due process (in March a Canadian citizen was denied entry due to an expired visa, while this was a worker and not a tourist, instead of being allowed to return to Canada, as is the norm, she was shackled in chains and sent to a private ICE facility for 2 weeks without being able to contact a lawyer or get a bed).

**3. Analysts previously predicted policies would decrease tourism by 5%, new numbers released this week show that it's 14x higher:** For Canada alone (26% of US's entire tourism industry with 20 million visitors) - airline travel is **down** **70%**, land travel is **down** **45%**, and **85%+** of tourists survey say they cancelled their US trips.

**4. Here's how I'm planning on using this information to make stock trades into specific companies both long and short:** I'm shorting airlines that have high exposure to Can-US routes (it's been reported that airlines are slashing these routes due to 0 demand, and they is no clear way they can cover this revenue gap with a lower utilized fleet). I'm shorting select hospitality chains (hotels, restaurants) with high exposure/retail foot print in US states that border Canada like Niagara Falls. The US travel association says that even just a 10% dip in tourists will lead to $2 billion in economic losses and 140,000 jobs at risk (assuming 70% decrease from air travel happens across the board, that's $14b), I expect hospitality to have lower revenues. I'm shorting all non-essential or higher price retailers with a big footprint in hostility states, all these workers being laid off by lack of tourism + the fed job cuts won't have as much to spend (not my specific trade, but an example would be short Target, long Dollar General).

I'm long, and buying, non-American/Europe hotel chains and travel booking platforms that get most of their revenue outside the US, as I expect Canadian and international tourists to concentrate their spend to Europe/Asia/Oceania travel this summer.

**Edit 5. How do the European/International figures play?**

It's important to note that the Canadian tourism numbers dipped after the policies that happened in point 2. And we're seeing what those numbers are a few months later now. The US admin is rolling out these policies across the board tomorrow during ""Liberation Day"". The point here is that we won't see the true vector of an internal tourism boycott both in terms of magnitude and direction until the policies that were enacted on Canada are enacted globally, and consumers have time to adjust behaviour. But if the Canadian consumer is any indication, I have more conviction in my trades. **A glimpse into this being a trend is a French travel company reporting to Bloomberg their Europe to US travel bookings are down 25%.**

**Edit 6. Example of the airline play**

Yes I know US airlines are already down a lot. Rode that wave and exited my shorts. Now I'm shorting Air Canada and ONEX (parent company of WestJet), since they have much more exposure to US-Can routes, and are cutting routes dramatically with no increase in capacity elsewhere

Also looking to short airline maitence companies, the food suppliers specific to flight food, and fuel refineries/storage those two airlines use, and retail stores with large exposure to airports that only see US/Canada travel.

But going long on regional air craft hangers since their smaller fleets are used the most for US/Canada travel, while their bigger fleets will still be active for the europe/asia flight routes that havn't seen impact on demand.

Would like to hear what everyone thinks about this trade play. Thanks!

Still remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.

Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.

Meta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren’t making money. Zuckerberg was ""burning billions"" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.

It wasn’t just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google’s ad revenue shrank. Microsoft’s growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.

And then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.

Meta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.

When markets are crashing, it feels like they’ll never go up again. When they’re at all-time highs, it feels like they’ll never go down. Neither is true.

1ibf2mt,2025-01-27,2025-01-27 12:44:35,Markets are Overreacting to DeepSeek,"The markets are overreacting to the DeepSeek news. 

Nvidia and big tech stocks losing a trillion dollars in value is not realistic. 

I personally am buying more NVDA stock off the dip. 

So what is going on?

The reason for the drop:  Investors think DeepSeek threatens to disrupt the US big tech dominance by enabling smaller companies and cost-sensitive enterprises with an open source and low cost, high performance model. 

Here is why I think fears are overblown.

1. Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and other big tech firms have massive war chests to outspend competitors. Nvidia alone spent nearly $9 billion on R&D in 2024 and can quickly adapt to new threats by enhancing its offerings or lowering costs if necessary.

2. Nvidia’s dominance isn’t just about hardware—it’s deeply tied to its software ecosystem, particularly CUDA, which is the gold standard for AI and machine learning development. This ecosystem is entrenched in research labs, enterprises, and cloud platforms worldwide.

3. People have to understand the risk that comes with DeepSeek coming out of China. There will be major adoption barriers from key markets as folks worry about data security, sanctions, government overreach etc. 

4. US just announced $500b to AI infrastructure via Stargate. The government has substantial resourcing to subsidize or lower barriers for brands like Nvidia.

Critiques tend to fall into two camps…

1. Nvidias margins are going to be eroded 

To this I think we have to acknowledge that while lower margins and demand would impact the stock both of these are speculative. 

Increased efficiency typically increases demand. And Nvidias customers are pretty entrenched, it’s def not certain they will bleed customers. 

On top of that Nvidia’s profitability isn’t solely tied to selling GPUs. Its software stack (e.g., CUDA), enterprise services, and licensing deals contribute significantly. These high-margin revenue streams I would guess are going to remain solid even if hardware pricing pressures increase.

2. Open source has a number of relative advantages

I think open source is heavily favorited by startups and indie developers (Open source is strongly favored by Reddit specifically). But the enterprise buyer doesn’t typically lean this way.

Open-source solutions require significant internal expertise for implementation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Large enterprises often prefer Nvidia’s support and commercial-grade stack because they get a dedicated team for ongoing updates, security patches, and scalability.",2296,820,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibf2mt/markets_are_overreacting_to_deepseek/,year,Unknown,0.9

Southwest Airlines (LUV) CEO Bob Jordan said Thursday the drop-off in business detected in February was one the most pronounced he has seen. “That is a very rapid fall-off,"" he said on CNBC. ""It’s probably the most that I have seen absent COVID.""

The carrier believes economic unease, rather than Southwest's plans to charge baggage fees or assign customers seats, has weighed on sales, Jordan said.

“A lot of that is, I think, the consumer reaction to the tariffs,"" he said on CNBC: ""Some of that could be front-running the tariffs in terms of spending money in other locations. So it could snap back.”

It's concerning when fast food and retail businesses start seeing contradicting sales from the US consumer. Especially staples that are concerned with affordability like Walmart and McDonalds. If Consumers are pulling back spending on ""cheap"", low cart value items like a McDonalds meal then it signals to me a budget constrained, worried consumer who won't spend.

The flip side of this that other fast food companies like Domino's have been doing fine. So maybe this is also a combination of McDonald's price hikes, lack of promotions and affordability, and increased competition. It could be both the macro and also the company specific issues that created this result.

1ik5337,2025-02-07,2025-02-07 15:39:55,Chinese Markets are Rejecting Tesla,"China Is Moving On from Tesla  
  
Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is slipping, and nowhere is that more obvious than in China. According to new report from CNBC, Tesla’s sales in China dropped 11.5% this January compared to the same time last year. With China setting the pace for the global EV industry, Tesla is rapidly losing ground to local giants like BYD.

It’s not just a sales dip, it’s a wipeout. In January, BYD sold 30% more EVs than Tesla worldwide. The reason? Cost and variety.

While Tesla leans on price cuts to compete, Chinese brands like BYD are already priced lower from the start. Tesla’s profit margins, once its strong suit, are shrinking fast, while BYD keeps scaling production without sacrificing profitability. The Model 3 and Model Y Tesla’s core models are struggling to hold their own against a flood of cheaper, high-tech, government-backed alternatives.

For years, Tesla thrived under China’s policies that welcomed foreign EV makers. That era is over. The Chinese government has made it clear, they want their own brands to lead the global EV race. Companies like BYD, Nio, and XPeng are now the priority, while Tesla is increasingly seen as an outsider.

Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory, once a strategic advantage, is now a vulnerability. The Chinese government could tighten regulations",1787,312,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ik5337/chinese_markets_are_rejecting_tesla/,year,Unknown,0.93

Medical devices, car parts, farm equipment, thousands of other things that they had been playing ball on so they could stay on the good side of the US.  Well the US just threw that all away, so now China is not bound by anything, they can just copy anything they want, slap their label on it, and sell it at their price, and full quality.

  
If Chinese companies do this, it would be a further wedge between the US and China, and a substantial problem down the road if a rapprochement was tried.

  
The drug companies are most at risk on this one IMO.  China can just start making all the US patented treatments, at full quality and start selling them at 50% of the price that the US companies are charging other countries around the world.  For those thinking they can't steal the full formulas for the products, if they can steal the plans for fighter jets, they can get the recipes for drugs.

  
What happens to the pharma companies when the Chinese start to sell newly patented treatments at 50 cents on the dollar?  What happens to the BioTech companies when the Chinese make cheap identical copies of their products?

1k2ez1u,2025-04-18,2025-04-18 16:36:26,Buffett's alternative to tariffs is seriously brilliant (Import Certificates),"I'm honestly not sure how this hasn't been brought up more, but Buffett actually has a beautifully elegant alternative to tariffs that solves for the trade deficit (which is a very real problem, he said in 2006.... ""The U.S. trade deficit is a bigger threat to the domestic economy than either the federal budget deficit or consumer debt and could lead to political turmoil..."")

Here's how Import Certificates work...

* Every time a U.S. company exports goods, it receives ""Import Certificates"" equal to the dollar amount exported.
* Foreign companies wanting to import into the U.S. must purchase these certificates from U.S. exporters.
* These certificates trade freely in an open market, benefiting U.S. exporters with an extra revenue stream, and gently nudging up the price of imports.

The brilliance is that trade automatically balances itself out—exports must match imports. No government bureaucracy, no targeted trade wars, no crony capitalism, and no heavy-handed tariffs.

Buffett was upfront: Import Certificates aren't perfect. Imported goods would become slightly pricier for American consumers, at least initially. But tariffs have that same drawback, with even more negative consequences like trade wars and global instability.

The clear advantages:

* **Automatic balance:** Exports and imports stay equal, reducing America's dangerous trade deficit.
* **More competitive exports:** U.S. businesses get a direct benefit, making them stronger in global markets.
* **Job creation:** Higher exports mean more domestic production and, consequently, more American jobs.
* **Market-driven:** No new bureaucracy or complex regulation—just supply and demand at work.

I honestly don't know how this isn't being talked about more! Hell, we could rename them Trump Certificates if we need to, but I think this policy needs to get up to policymakers ASAP haha.

We made a full video on our YT channel, but I won't post a link here to respect the rules of the sub!

Delinquency credit reports are landing for 9.2 million people (**43% of Americans with payments due**), due to hitting the 90 day mark of missed payments since late 2024’s resume of credit reporting on federal student loans.  

Why is this important? Student loans are dispersed by semester, not consolidated. While 1 payment is typically made, it’s spread out to 8+ loans.

**""THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT""**

To the unsuspecting eye, he simply signed that post with his initials.  To those in the know, you know exactly what he was saying:

**""....TIME TO BUY DJT""**

And they did, DJT ran up about 9% in no time at all. And if you read posts on Truth Social they were all giddy that Trump gave them a head's up. Trump's stake in DJT went up by millions (he owns around 3B last I read).  A 9% gain on 3 billion is a tidy sum.  And that was in a matter of minutes.  But he wasn't done.

A couple of hours later Trump announced a pause on tariffs, China being the exception and the market blew up (in the way we like).

**Right this moment DJT is up 20% so Trump has seen a $600,000,000 gain in a few hours.**

1nf46bi,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 10:06:01,Is Oracle just SoftBank wearing a mask?,"Let me get this straight:

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?

The Atlanta Federal Reserve is projecting a contraction of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) of 1.5 percent in the first quarter, flashing a warning sign for the U.S. economy.

The projection is a significant shift for the Atlanta Fed over the last few weeks that comes a little more than a month after President Trump took office.

The Atlanta Fed last week was predicting 2.3 percent positive growth for the first quarter. A month ago, it was registering 3.9 percent growth.

The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow measure is not an official forecast but rather a running estimate of real GDP growth based on data as it comes in.

The first quarter ends at the end of March, and GDP will be officially calculated by the Commerce Department.

But the forward-looking indicator’s major drop will still be of significant concern to policymakers, economists and markets alike, especially as fourth-quarter GDP registered a strong second estimate this week.

Moody’s Ratings on Monday downgraded the long-term ratings of several of America’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), citing weakened prospects of federal support following Friday’s U.S. sovereign downgrade. The move marks a rare blow to the top tier of the U.S. financial system and may raise borrowing costs and regulatory pressure on institutions still seen as systemically important.

The rating agency lowered deposit ratings, senior unsecured debt, and counterparty risk assessments for key subsidiaries and branches of the banks to Aa2 from Aa1. These ratings had previously included a notch of uplift tied to the government’s Aaa rating, support Moody’s no longer deems as fully credible following the downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt to Aa1.

“The downgrade of the US Government’s rating indicates that it has less ability to support the US’s global systemically important banks,” Moody’s said. “The ratings and assessments downgraded in today’s action all previously incorporated one notch of US Government support uplift and this notch of support has now been removed.”

1.When Jensen Huang immigrated to the U.S. as a kid, he ended up in a small rural town and got bullied pretty badly. But instead of reacting with defiance or lashing out, he just smiled and brushed it off. Calm and quiet resilience.

He later said he got into physical training thanks to a roommate, and he started doing tons of push-ups. Eventually, his build changed and that might’ve naturally put an end to the bullying.
	
2.He was really good at table tennis. He seriously considered going pro during his school years. Even after founding NVIDIA, he kept a ping pong table in the office, tucked away in the corner.

3.He’s always been this upbeat, warm-hearted kind of guy. He didn’t like cutting people loose. That’s why NVIDIA’s hiring process was notoriously tough. His philosophy was that if you hire carefully, you won’t need to fire.

At a public meeting one day, he pressed a junior employee, asking, “What value are you delivering here at NVIDIA compared to what you’re paid?” The guy was crushed by it. But later, when that same employee was diagnosed with a rare illness, Jensen tried to cover his treatment personally from his own pocket.

4.He wasn’t like this back in his AMD days, but once he became a CEO, “Hwaung's rage” became a thing. Not in a toxic but more like explosive passion when he disagrees with something. People say that ""If you’ve experienced his rage, you’ve become part of the inner circle at NVIDIA""

5.Around 2014(I don't remember exactly) a junior engineer who was lazy but quite creative noticed a potential link between deep learning and NVIDIA chips. Despite having a relatively low performance record, the guy went straight to Jensen and pitched his idea with everything he had. Maybe he figured he had nothing to lose.

Jensen listened. Then he ripped the roadmap off the wall and declared, “This is our future.”
From that moment on, NVIDIA bet everything on AI. CUDA became the heart of their strategy, and they poured everything into developing GPUs optimized for machine learning.

They have a small amount in IRAs—maybe around $15,000 combined—but that’s about it. They’ve always just kept their money in a regular savings account with their bank. No high-yield savings accounts, no stocks, no mutual funds, and not even certificates of deposit (CDs). For decades, they’ve earned next to nothing in interest—probably less than $15 a month.

Growing up, we were a family of five. My dad earned around $85,000 a year, and my mom worked part-time, bringing in maybe $25,000 annually. We weren’t rich, but we were comfortable. They worked hard to provide for us, but they never prioritized investing or learned much about it. Now, as they’re getting closer to retirement, my dad still plans to work for a while since he runs his own business and enjoys it.

It’s honestly eye-opening to think about what could have been if they’d started investing earlier—like back in the '80s or '90s. Even a little bit in the stock market over all those years could’ve made a huge difference.

For me, I didn’t start investing until my late 20s because it wasn’t something we ever talked about at home. My parents never really understood it, so they never passed that knowledge down.

What’s the purpose of this sub? The mod team says we shouldn’t post financial news by itself since they are “low effort posts”, so they are encouraging personal opinions being shared.

But then you have people just asking simple questions, and most of the answers are “just buy index funds” regardless of what the questions are.

Any long-form opinions are either met with dismissive “you have no idea what you are talking about, just by $VOO” or no response at all. 

So we can’t post financial news by themselves, and this isn’t the sub for single stock discussions, and any generic investment discussion just leads to “buy index funds”.

Btw mods, I understand that you guys don’t want “low-effort posts”, but if a post received 300+ upvotes and 200 comments within 3 hours (and many of those comments had efforts put into them), maybe it’s ok to leave it up? It’s not like the front page is full anyway. It’s frustrating to see a thread heating up only for you guys to remove the entire thing. 

Edit: Honestly I’ll just say it: I think the mods are more at fault because their vision of a high quality, high engagement discussion forum with high barrier of entry is simply not achievable on a platform like Reddit without making the sub semi-private with individual vetting process, which takes a ton of work that I’m not sure the mods are willing to spend time on.

I’ve been a mod on a couple super large subs and i fully understand how difficult and thankless the job can be. But my philosophy is that moderators of large subs should be the caretakers instead of gatekeepers.

1hvcot5,2025-01-06,2025-01-06 18:04:40,This is why we dont buy Chinese stocks: US Dept of Defense Labels Tencent a military company ,"
From [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline?embedded-checkout=true):

The U.S. Department of Defense has added Tencent Holdings and CATL to its blacklist of companies allegedly linked to China's military, causing Tencent's U.S.-listed shares to drop nearly 10%. This move is part of the Pentagon's ""Section 1260H list,"" which now names 134 firms believed to support China's military-civil fusion strategy, where civilian tech is leveraged for military purposes.

Tencent, known for WeChat and major gaming investments, has denied the allegations and plans to work with U.S. authorities to clear up what it calls a misunderstanding. Similarly, CATL, a key supplier of EV batteries to Tesla, Ford, and BMW, refuted the claims, calling their inclusion a mistake and stating they have no involvement in military activities.

While the designation doesn't impose immediate sanctions, it signals increased risk for U.S. investors and partners. Companies previously added to this list, like DJI, have faced serious business disruptions, including bans and reputational hits.

Both Tencent and CATL are expected to challenge the decision, but this adds to the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. Investors should keep an eye on this situation as it could impact these stocks and broader U.S.-China market relations.

1jzpaj2,2025-04-15,2025-04-15 07:18:20,They cannot allow treasury yields to go above ~5%.,"I'm going to present the case for why the US government/Fed will intervene in any way necessary to prevent yields from going above \~5%.

In the modern era, the minimum spending level, not including interest expenses, by the US government is 15.1% of GDP. That was in the year 2000. [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1I9bO](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1I9bO)

In the modern era, the maximum tax receipts level by the US government is 20.4% of GDP. That was also in the year 2000. [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1I9bR](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1I9bR)

You can subtract those two numbers to get 20.4 - 15.1 = 5.3%. This represents the maximum surplus we could generate, if we raise taxes to the highest level on record and cut spending to the lowest level on record. Beyond this is likely politically impossible, especially given the current administration.

This means that if our annual interest expense exceeds 5.3% of GDP, we would be *forced* to default or print money to cover the excess. We couldn't borrow more because rates would go up exponentially, in classic debt crisis fashion - at that point, everyone knows you can only pay them back with more borrowed money. It's basic math.

At this point, I should point out that the sitting president has stated that we never have to default because [""you print the money.""](https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/09/politics/donald-trump-national-debt-strategy/index.html)

We are currently sitting on the largest debt since WWII: $36 trillion. However, the Fed has already bought about $5 trillion of that debt, meaning about $31 trillion is actually owed to entities outside the government.

Our GDP is $29 trillion. If the average interest rate on the national debt was 5%, our annual interest payment would be $31 trillion × 0.05 = $1.55 trillion. That is 5.3% of GDP. That is the threshold for unsustainability, as I demonstrated in the previous paragraphs.

Yields may temporarily go above 5%, but they cannot allow them to stay there or else large amounts of the debt would become refinanced at this unsustainable rate. They will intervene through any means necessary.

1kpng3q,2025-05-18,2025-05-18 12:05:25,Pilotless planes are taking flight in China. Bank of America says it’s time to buy,"While startups around the world have tried to build vehicles that can fly without a pilot, only one is certified to carry people — in China.

U.S.-listed [Ehang](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/EH/) received this certification from China’s aviation regulator in late March, and the company plans to begin operating flights for tourists [along a few designated routes by the end of June](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/04/china-may-see-flying-taxis-in-three-years-ehang-predicts.html). The vehicle, known as an eVTOL aircraft, carries two passengers and uses electric power for vertical take-off and landing, similar to a helicopter.

“Ehang should maintain 100% market share in China over 2025-27, as the strict \[the Civil Aviation Administration of China\] airworthiness process poses a high entry barrier to new entrants,” Bank of America Greater China industrials stock analysts said in a May 14 report.

They initiated coverage of the stock with a “buy” rating, and predict the stock can reach $26 — 36% above Friday’s close. The stock is up more than 20% for the year so far.

The analysts expect Ehang to benefit from national policy support and faster-than-expected delivery to tourism customers.

Ehang also [ranked first among global players](https://aamrealityindex.com/f/advanced-air-mobility-reality-index-april-2025-release) as the most likely to reach the thousand-unit-a-year milestone through widespread certification and adoption, according to a recent report from U.S.-based SMG Consulting.

U.S.-based rival [Joby Aviation](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JOBY/), whose shares have dropped 9% year to date, ranked fourth. Fifth in the rankings was [Archer Aviation](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ACHR/). Its shares are up 36% for the year. The company on Thursday announced it will be the official air taxi provider for the [Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 2028](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250515642674/en/Archer-Selected-as-the-Official-Air-Taxi-Provider-of-the-LA28-Olympic-and-Paralympic-Games-and-Team-USA-in-Exclusive-Deal).

Bank of America does not currently cover either stock.

The [U.S. Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/air-taxis) has been [working on certification rules](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/archer-aviation-faa-signoff.html) for allowing the companies to fly their vehicles with passengers in the U.S., although initial focus is on piloted flights.

In contrast, China has accelerated its efforts [in the last two years](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202503/1329853.shtml) to develop what it calls the “low-altitude economy.”

About 300 local Chinese governments have announced related plans as of April 2025, which include investment in infrastructure for eVTOL operation and business subsidies, the Bank of America analysts said in a separate May 14 report about the overall industry.

Ehang’s certified model, the 216-S, sells for about 2.39 million yuan ($330,000) in China, and $410,000 outside China, the report said. It noted that the larger, 4-seat Joby S4 sells for $1.3 million.

“We conclude that the central gov’t sees the development of low-altitude economy as the crucial strategic industry to China’s economy in the coming few years,” the analysts said.

The policy also covers support for using drones to deliver food and supplies to tourist sites in the mountains. Such tests [gained popularity over the May 1 Labor Day](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/07/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-tourism-surge-defies-slowdown.html) holiday in China.

Several Chinese companies from Xpeng to Volant are also working on flying devices that carry people. Short-haul aerial vehicles can also help with firefighting and emergency services.

For Ehang, the Bank of America analysts predict each tourist attraction will want to buy five to 10 eVTOLs, supporting a total potential China market of 80,000 units.

In the near term, they estimate Ehang’s delivery volume will reach 442 units this year, and 813 next year. “This will translate into 103%/82% revenue growth in 2025/26E,” the report said.

Another, more distant, area of potential growth is the urban air taxi market.

While the analysts expect tourism to be the main driver of demand in the near term, they expect air taxis to grow their share starting from the year 2035. Based on the current taxi and ride-hailing car market, Bank of America estimates total demand for eVTOL air taxis could reach 200,000 units in the future.

The Dow pulled back 5.5% to enter into correction territory. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (GSPC) sank nearly 6%, as the broad-based benchmark capped its worst week since 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 5.8% to close in bear market territory.

The major averages added to Thursday's $2.5 trillion wipeout after China said it will impose additional tariffs of 34% on all US products from April 10 — matching the extra 34% duties imposed by Trump on Wednesday.

That ramped up investor worries that countries are more likely to retaliate than negotiate, leading to a protracted global trade war.

Investors flocked to government bonds as the 10-year Treasury (TNX) yield fell to 3.9%, nearing its lowest levels since October.

Economists are warning that with tariffs as-is, the risk of a US recession is rising. The monthly jobs report, unusually overshadowed Friday, showed a labor market that held steady ahead of Trump's biggest tariffs. The US added 228,000 jobs in March, beating estimates, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%.

Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Powell for the first time addressed the reality of the tariffs, saying they were ""higher than anticipated."" He said it is ""too soon to say"" what the proper rate path should be. Traders have ramped up bets on interest rate cuts this year to five, as the Fed is expected to set its efforts to cool inflation aside to tackle the bigger risk of economic slowdown.

Trump, posting on Truth Social on Friday, added to fears by saying that his policies ""will never change"" and warning that China ""played it wrong.""

1mumnf5,2025-08-19,2025-08-19 12:03:10,The Fed is Not Cutting in September,"Everyone piling into “September rate cut” bets is ignoring the actual data and listening to wishful thinking. The Fed isn’t going to hand out a cut just because markets want it.

The labor market is still holding up. Sure, unemployment has ticked up a little, but it’s nowhere near a collapse. Powell has already said they’ll tolerate some labor pain before even thinking about easing. If you’re waiting for the Fed to rescue every weak jobs print, you’re not paying attention.

Inflation is still too high. Core PCE is hovering above 2.5 percent and closer to 2.7 or 2.8. That’s not a victory lap. That’s exactly the range where Powell has said he doesn’t have “confidence” inflation is under control. Cutting now would risk reigniting it and blowing up the last two years of progress.

Powell is not a dove. Every time markets get ahead of themselves, he slaps them down. Jackson Hole is coming up, and if history tells us anything, he’ll remind everyone that the Fed is data dependent, not market dependent. Translation: he doesn’t care about your bets.

Credibility is everything right now. Cutting while inflation is still running hot and the jobs market is still functioning would make the Fed look weak. They’d rather be accused of holding too long than cutting too early and losing control.

History backs this up. The Fed doesn’t pivot on one or two soft jobs reports. Policy lags mean hikes are still filtering through. They know it. That’s why they’ll hold.

Bottom line: There’s no cut in September. Unless we suddenly get a jobs collapse and inflation magically melts away, the Fed is staying put.

It sounds like a feel-good headline that allows Trump to tout a win, but makes little material difference to Apple’s existing spending. In exchange, Apple gets the tariff exemptions it wants without actually giving up much.

From CNBC:

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/apples-tim-cook-convinced-trump-to-drop-made-in-usa-iphone-for-now.html

“Apple has little to worry about when it comes to who will hold the company accountable for its promises. The company doesn’t break out U.S. spending, and most of Apple’s suppliers are contractually required to keep the information secret. Apple doesn’t report how much its new campuses in Austin or North Carolina end up costing.

Additionally, the $600 billion headline number likely includes lots of regular expenses.

Apple said in February that its $500 billion commitment included payments to U.S. suppliers, direct employment, data centers for Apple Intelligence and corporate facilities, as well as spending on Apple TV+ productions in 20 states.

In Apple’s fiscal 2024, Apple spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses, and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period.

Teffler said she didn’t think the newly announced spending would be material to Apple’s profitability, especially since it already has existing relationships with the various companies such as Corning.”",920,238,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mkezph/what_exactly_does_apple_investing_100_billion_600/,year,Unknown,0.95

Fed governor Stephen Miran preferred to cut rates by a half a percentage point and disagreed with the quarter percentage cut.

The Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point with a landslide 11-to-1 vote, setting the target range between 4% and 4.25%.  The 1 vote dissented from Miran, favoring a larger 50-basis-point cut instead.

The **decision of a 25 BP cut** was based mainly on the following:

* **Labor market concerns** with recent job gains have slowed significantly, and the unemployment rate has edged up.
* **Economic slowdown** with indicators suggests economic activity grew at a more moderate pace in the first half of the year.
* **Acknowledged inflation** remains somewhat elevated, but the Fed judged that the rising downside risks to employment warranted a rate cut. 

Officials signaled the possibility of **two more rate cuts** this year.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024).

The U.S. House of Representatives has passed legislation, dubbed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which introduces a new Section 899 to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. This proposed section aims to ""weaponize"" taxes on foreign investors by significantly increasing tax rates for certain non-U.S. individuals and businesses.

**Key aspects of Section 899:**

* **Purpose:** It is intended as a diplomatic tool to counter what the U.S. considers ""unfair foreign taxes"" imposed by other countries on U.S. businesses and individuals. These ""unfair foreign taxes"" include undertaxed profits rules (UTPRs), digital services taxes (DSTs), and diverted profits taxes (DPTs).
* **Mechanism:** The legislation would apply increased U.S. federal income tax rates—ranging from 5% to 20% incrementally—on certain income earned by non-U.S. persons from ""discriminatory foreign countries."" A ""discriminatory foreign country"" is defined as any non-U.S. jurisdiction that imposes one or more of these ""unfair foreign taxes.""
* **Affected Parties:** The heightened tax rates would apply to a broad category of foreign persons, including foreign governments, sovereign wealth funds, individuals, corporations, private foundations, trusts, and partnerships associated with these designated countries.
* **Impact:** If enacted, Section 899 could introduce substantial economic and compliance challenges for foreign governments, multinational enterprises, and investors. Experts suggest it could lead to the ""weaponization of U.S. capital markets"" and potentially weaken the dollar and impact European stocks with U.S. exposure.
* **Current Status:** The bill has passed the U.S. House of Representatives and now moves to the U.S. Senate for consideration, where significant changes are still anticipated",837,122,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kzhu69/proposed_us_foreign_tax_bill_would_make_us_assets/,year,Unknown,0.95

Speaking during a visit to Argentina, Bessent noted that the Trump administration would use the approximately six months leading up to Powell’s term expiration to make preparations.​

President Trump has publicly urged Powell to reduce interest rates, raising concerns about pressure on the Fed’s independence. However, Bessent stated he is not worried about Trump undermining Powell or the central bank's autonomy. He emphasized the importance of separating the Fed’s monetary policy role from its bank regulatory functions, suggesting more discussion is needed on the latter given the Fed shares regulatory duties with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC.​

Bessent also shared that he meets weekly with Powell to discuss a wide range of issues and noted there are currently no significant concerns about financial market stability or bond market developments.​""

1jvherg,2025-04-09,2025-04-09 17:31:58,Insider Trading - A new tax on the stock market,"I think it's fairly clear that the events today constitute insider trading, plain and simple. The sharp rise in volume, 10 minutes before the official announcement - pure coincidence, maybe. Still warrants an investigation in any just society, and will never come due to congress having power over it.

This is just something to remember whenever you invest in the stock market now. Insider trading directly takes money out of the market from less informed investors, and that's all of us. The presidency has now established that they can siphon part of your money through its information asymmetry. This is effectively a tax on all investment in the stock market. 

So what can we do about this?

Unfortunately, seemingly very little. The powers that be are in charge of pressing charges, so no charges will be levied. As they say, we just ""don't have the cards"". If anyone has any suggestions, please let us know. Until then, all we can do is remember that now, any investment carries an implicit tax, and trade / invest accordingly.

Full Prepared Remarks:
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250525a.htm

Excerpt:

“After graduation, I had no plan and no job, and wound up putting labels on shelves in a warehouse for six months. I didn't feel great about that. One of my closest friends was getting a master's at Stanford, and I could only think—""Nice going, Jay. You really nailed it."" In hindsight, that time in the warehouse was a blessing, and exactly what I needed. The next fall I entered law school, and for the first time I was highly resolved to make the most of the opportunity.

You know what? We all move at our own pace, and that's ok. Fifty years later I can tell you something I did not know then: The vast majority of what you need to know about work, about relationships, about yourself, about life, you have yet to learn. And that itself is a tremendous gift. Over the remainder of your life, you can—you must—continue to educate yourself and to grow as a person, becoming more focused on what really matters, more widely knowledgeable, better read, more disciplined, and more strategic. But also wiser, kinder, more empathetic, more generous, more loving, more forgiving of others and of yourself. Each of us is a work in progress. The possibilities for self-improvement are limitless.

Another thing I have realized is that while hard work, determination, and creativity matter a great deal to success in life, luck plays a big role too. All of us here are tremendously lucky. I know that, at a handful of critical times in my life, I got really lucky—beginning at birth.

My parents were well educated. They gave the six Powell kids a safe, loving home, and placed a high value on learning. They gave us everything we needed to thrive. That bit of luck led to the good luck I share with all of you, the chance to earn a degree from America's finest university.

Another thing I have learned along the way is that, as you strive in coming years to reach your full potential, you will need to take risks and make mistakes.

Everyone makes mistakes. Take it from an expert! But the bigger mistake is to avoid taking risks.”",824,22,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kvfl1c/frb_chair_jerome_powells_commencement_speech_at/,year,Unknown,0.98
1khk8sf,2025-05-08,2025-05-08 03:28:39,"Google is at a 40 pe ratio, excluding the search revenue","Yes, this is another post about how cheap Google is.

Here’s the deal: Google’s net income for 2024 was $100 billion, with 55% of that coming from search.
With a $1.8 trillion market cap, Google would “only” need to have a PE ratio of 40—this is considering revenue only from its fast-growing segments like Cloud, YouTube, Waymo, etc.

To put it in context, here are a few companies with similar businesses and their high PE ratios:

Microsoft: 34
Netflix: 54
Tesla: 152
Palantir: 480
Google (excluding search): 40

This completely excludes the search business, as if it stopped generating any revenue overnight. That obviously won’t happen. Even if we see a slowdown in growth or a decline, search will still generate massive amounts of money, which can be used for significant buybacks—like those seen in the last quarter.

TL;DR: Google is basically a fast-growing company with a PE ratio of 40, plus a “dying” business that’s still going to generate around $50 billion annually for the next five years.

Depending on your source, the average secular bull market is 16-17 years, and average secular bear market is ~12. The durations aren't fixed, and vary by as much as 10 years.

If trade wars start in earnest, one possible outcome is a severe economic contraction, as costs skyrocket and demand subsides. This would put strain on the weaknesses in the system, which could exacerbate the problem (i.e. post-covid commercial real estate).

My question is, for those more informed, what factors contributed to secular bear markets in the past? Do we face similar headwinds today? Why or why not?

Edit: A secular market refers to a long-term trend in the financial markets that lasts for years or even decades, driven by fundamental economic, demographic, or technological shifts. It lasts multiple shorter bull and bear market cycles.

I'm not sure that makes a lot of sense if you play it out.,"The wealthy hold a disproportionate percentage of stocks. Many have their wealth concentrated in a single business that they own or work for, that is harder to liquidate.

Since the wealthy own most of the capital, they stand to lose the most if it drops in value. 

The common statement I keep hearing is ""the wealthy want a crash so they can buy everything up at reduced prices and reap the benefits of the rebound."" 

The Buffets of the world, patiently sitting on a vast amount of loose funds, just waiting to buy stuff up, are few and far between. I understand how they would benefit.

But for most of the wealthy, it would mean they would be selling their invested capital (after a loss?) and buying something different. Is it simply a good time to trade their holdings? Or maybe I'm underestimating the idle cash on the sidelines that is waiting to be deployed.

Vanguard has reduced the expense ratios (the annual fees you pay) on many of their most popular ETFs. For example, their [Total International Stock ETF (VXUS)](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vxus) now costs just 0.05% per year – down from 0.08%. That’s a 37.5% reduction.

Investors benefit from reduced fees because every dollar saved in fees is a dollar that stays invested and can grow over time. While fees aren’t the only factor to consider when choosing investments, they’re one of the few aspects of investing that you can control. Lower fees mean more of your money stays invested for your future.

You don’t need to take any action to benefit from these lower fees if you already own affected Vanguard ETFs (list below). The reduced expenses will automatically apply to your investments.

Amid 9/11, Enron/Worldcom fraud, the NASDAQ crash, banking crisis, etc., gold prices climbed from $250 to $1,900 per ounce, with most of those gains squeezed into the last two years (1/1/2010 $1,110/ounce.)

4 years later, in 2015, gold prices had fallen to $1,050 per ounce, a 45% decline.

Now it’s going parabolic again … except there’s no financial crisis, or even an ordinary recession. There’s some instability with the tariffs. There are countries trying to reduce their exposure to US dollars. There are central banks that buy regardless of fundamentals. But these reasons still do not justify a 25% gain in 3 months.

Hong KongCNN — 

China unveiled retaliatory tariffs of 84% on imports of US goods on Wednesday, further inflaming a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.

The announcement means China has increased its intended levy on US imports by another 50 percentage points from the initial amount that was set to take effect on Thursday, matching the additional charge that US President Donald Trump has already imposed on Chinese goods.

Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs took effect earlier on Wednesday. China was the hardest-hit nation with a levy of at least 104% on all its goods. The two countries have been involved in a game of tit-for-tat on trade, with Beijing standing firmly against each new tariff introduced by Washington.",757,194,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jv48jo/china_announces_84_retaliatory_tariffs_on_us_goods/,year,Unknown,0.96

1npncdh,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 16:38:02,Be careful with quantum stocks,"I'm an engineer, and my sphere of competence is technology. I'm a believer in quantum computers. Here's why I think it's a bad idea to invest in quantum stocks.

You see, a successful business is not determined by how advanced the technology is, but by its ability to generate a pile of money. Business, first of all, is a cash generator. And we, as investors, want to own great cash generators. The problem with quantum stocks is that none of them are great businesses (aside from maybe IBM and Google, which aren't really ""quantum stocks"").

Let's put aside the complexity of quantum computing and how difficult it is to scale. Let's assume we've solved all technical issues. Do you know how much it costs to build and maintain a quantum solution? Do you know how much it would cost to develop commercialized mass-manufacturing? To educate the personnel? The answer: a freaking unimaginable amount.
  
There's no company in Taiwan that will print you quantum chips on demand. There aren't millions of quantum engineers and software programmers waiting to be employed. The infrastructure does not exist. Quantum technology won't be scalable for decades - maybe half a century.
  
You can't even compare quantum to the AI revolution. AI is still silicon-based and can reuse existing infrastructure. Quantum technology reimagines our entire approach to computing from scratch. And it costs a hell of a lot of money (tons of debt, none of profit).

None of the companies on the market will dominate the quantum space. They're not businesses - they're research labs (and some are scams). The companies that will eventually build infrastructure, hire engineers, and scale to the market don't exist yet.

Technology doesn't mean business. Research doesn't mean cash. And sadly, even established companies with fully built infrastructure and strong brands can fail as businesses (sorry, Intel, I'm talking about you).

See how absurd it is that current quantum stocks already have billions in market cap, sitting alongside successful businesses? These companies print flashy news releases and talk big about how quantum will change everything. They exploit public ignorance about technology to sell wet dreams stuffed with money bags. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Your money will soon end up in the pockets of insiders and hedge funds.

This is a reality check not just for quantum stocks, but for tech hype in general. Think twice where you put your money. Maybe it's better to take your profit, consider yourself lucky, and buy your girlfriend flowers or a house?

Not investment advice, of course, but I'd rather put a smile on a girl's face than invest in quantum. ;)

P.S.
When in doubt, trust fundamentals, not your biases. Don't fool yourself into thinking you would've picked Nvidia in 2015 if you only had the information available in 2015. Today is the same - you don't know who's going to be the champ in 2035. It will surprise us all.

1kmgc3m,2025-05-14,2025-05-14 10:18:16,Why aren’t Treasury investors sounding the alarm about the Tax Cut extension?,"Congress has released draft legislative text for extending the 2017 tax cuts. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated the proposed legislation would add $5.6 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, to be offset by $1.9 trillion in spending reductions, for a net cost of $3.7 trillion. (Source: https://thehill.com/business/budget/5297588-republicans-tax-bill-jct/amp/ )

This is on top of a national debt figure that's already projected to rise above $50 trillion by the end of this decade without new fiscally expansionary legislation being passed.

Some Republicans representing battleground states have criticized the proposed spending reductions (mainly to lower-income social welfare programs & clean energy incentives) as being politically unpalatable. Historically, when this happens, congressional leadership tends to trim down some of the cuts & throw the cost onto the deficit, because these battleground legislators are on the front lines of deciding which party wins the majority.

Even the draft $3.7T cost would be by far the most expensive legislation ever passed, exceeding the 2020 CARES Act, the 2021 Rescue Plan, and the 2022 Inflation Reduction (EV incentives) Act. And it’s unlikely to be a large stimulus to economic growth, considering that most of the bill simply extends the 2017 tax reform (although there are some targeted new provisions like no tax on tips etc.)

Three years ago, when Liz Truss proposed big (and largely-unfunded) tax cuts in the UK, bond investors sent Gilt yields soaring from 3.5% to 5%, requiring the Bank of England to intervene. Truss resigned as Prime Minister after only 45 days, and she lost her Parliament seat in the next election.

Meanwhile, Treasury investors have remained calm. 10-year yields have settled around 4.5% in the last few days, and in fact are slightly lower today. They don’t seem to be alarmed by the exponential growth in deficits & the national debt. What explains this?

1inu9y7,2025-02-12,2025-02-12 11:02:59,Is the Tesla Bubble about to pop?,"I’m not a Tesla expert, and I’m sure many of you have deeper insights into the company, but after watching the latest developments, I have some concerns that I wanted to share as a long time holder. Tesla’s stock is sitting around $330 per share, up 75% from last year, but I’m struggling to see how it justifies the current valuation.

Here’s a list of what bothers me:

1. **Elon Musk’s PR Nightmare** – It’s hard to ignore how much Musk’s public image has deteriorated. Between the “Sieg Heil” incident on live TV and his controversial actions, he’s lost a lot of credibility, and by extension, Tesla’s brand has taken a serious hit. A lot of people now see him and the company as 'problematic'.

1. **Competition Is Catching Up Fast** – Tesla used to be the only game in town when it came to EVs and FSD, but that’s no longer the case. Other automakers are making significant strides in both areas, and some are already ahead in terms of technology and innovation.

1. **Declining Profit Margins** – Tesla’s profit margins have been shrinking year after year. This is concerning for a company that’s valued at over a trillion dollars. If this trend continues, it could put a major dent in their long-term prospects.

1. **The Cybertruck Disaster** – The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla’s next big thing, but it’s turned into more of a meme. The build quality issues and the general lack of progress on the product have made it a major disappointment, and it’s starting to look like a marketing gimmick more than a groundbreaking vehicle.

1. **Full Self-Driving Tech Overhyped** – Despite the constant chatter about robotaxis, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still stuck at Level 2-3. Other companies have already rolled out Level 4 autonomous vehicles, making Tesla’s claims look more like wishful thinking at this point.

1. **Political and Tariff Risks** – Tesla’s business is exposed to a number of external factors, from steel and aluminum tariffs to an anti-EV U.S. President. Plus, with a California governor who openly opposes Musk, there’s a real risk of losing state EV incentives, which would hurt sales.

1. **Raw Material Costs Are Rising** – Tesla is also facing increasing raw material costs, and tariffs on batteries imported from China could push those prices even higher. With profitability already under pressure, this is something that could really squeeze margins going forward.

1. **Struggling to Attract AI Talent** – Tesla’s ability to innovate in AI seems to be stalling. The company is having trouble attracting top AI talent, with many researchers opting to join OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies. This could set them back in the long run, especially as competitors accelerate their own AI developments.

1. **Losing Support from Left-Leaning Consumers** – Tesla’s alignment with Musk’s political views has alienated many left-leaning consumers, who are typically more inclined to purchase EVs. This shift in consumer sentiment could hurt Tesla’s market share, especially as alternatives to Tesla grow.

I used to think of Tesla as the Nvidia of EVs, miles ahead of everyone else. But right now, it feels like they’re slipping, with more and more companies closing the gap. Like probably lots of you (well, at least those on TikTok) I’ve been using the trademind AI a lot recently, and that also has TSLA as a clear red flag to sell now. With all these issues piling up, I really struggle to see how Tesla maintains its $1.1 trillion valuation.

> Treasury Department and IRS officials are predicting a decrease of more than 10 percent in tax receipts by the April 15 deadline compared with 2024, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share nonpublic data. That would amount to more than $500 billion in lost federal revenue; the IRS collected $5.1 trillion last year.  ... The prediction, officials say, is directly tied to changing taxpayer behavior and President Donald Trump’s rapid demolition of parts of the IRS. Senior tax agency officials issued detailed warnings about those outcomes to the incoming Trump administration before the president took office, according to records obtained by The Washington Post.

So this means the government might have to sell $500B more bonds, about 27% more than the current $1.8T deficit.

It seems this should drive long term rates up as the government struggles to sell more bonds, unless there is a another big QE bond purchase  (now, QT is being throttled back to close to neutral).   This means even bigger deficits as interest payments rise (already 11% of budget).    

Would the Fed bail out the government with QE if it struggled to sell long term bonds?  Or would Powell shrug as rising long term bond rates worked their anti-inflationary effect?

POTUS just called for lower rates.  Does he mean short term, or long term QE?  I assume the Fed will ignore the demand, again.

The balance-of-payments school (fiscal deficit drives trade deficit) suggests we will be importing more stuff, as foreigners buy our bonds.  But this stuff will be subject to tariffs,  seemingly further increasing inflation.

Thus I'm thinking of selling my long term bond fund (EDV) at breakeven; I had gotten it when rates peaked around 5% assuming inflation will be conquered and we'll return back to 3% soon, but this hope seems to be evaporating.

1jlg7j2,2025-03-27,2025-03-27 18:49:25,Missing a few days in market can cost you everything,"One of the strangest things about the stock market is how unevenly returns are distributed. The long-term trend might look steady on a chart, but almost all the actual gains happen in short, unpredictable bursts. Miss those bursts, and you miss everything.

Based on a study by JP Morgan, if you had simply stayed invested in the S&P500 from 2003 to 2022, a $10,000 sum would have grown to around $65,000. But if you missed just the 10 best days over that 20-year period, your return would have dropped by more than half. Miss 20 of the best days, and you’d end up with just $18,000. Miss 40 and you’d have less than you started with. All your gains came in just 40 out of 5000+ trading days! These numbers are extreme, but they’re not outliers—they repeat across every time period you look at.

What makes it harder is that the biggest up days usually come when things feel the worst. March 24, 2020, when COVID panic was at its peak, the market jumped 9.4% in one day. Dec 26 2018, following a significant downturn, the S&P500 posted a then-record increase of \~5%, one of the highest single day gain in the decade.

It’s emotionally uncomfortable to keep your money in the market when everything feels uncertain, pessimistic, and scary. But if you wait for clarity, you usually miss the recovery. And once the market changes it's mood, it starts moving up very fast. It doesn’t give you time to think or respond.

The idea of timing the market sounds logical: get out when it feels risky, get back in when things are better. But you can never predict when better comes. It can start tomorrow, or within couple months, or may take a year. Once recovery starts, it's hard to react quickly and convince yourself to jump in. You end up watching from the sidelines, waiting for a pullback that never comes.

(A longform ELI5 explainer on why the bond market is reacting — and why that's dangerous)","OK Reddit, I have been asked to synthesize a few ELI5 posts I made over the past week into an explainer, because folks found them helpful.  Believe me, it’s an exciting action story, covering the fall of Randy Reliable, cutthroat geopolitical macroeconomics, and some face-punching.  And you’ll learn why people in the know are worried. 

**TL;DR**: Bond yields aren’t just a number — they’re a signal of trust. And when the 10-year treasury starts rising during a market crash, it’s not a good sign. It means the world is losing faith in the U.S. Here’s why that’s dangerous, what it says about our leadership, and how macroeconomic pressure is the new frontline in geopolitical power.

## **Trade Wars and Tariffs, or, *How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds***

Over the past two weeks, equity markets have plummeted in response to Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement.  However, by the middle of last week, the 10-year treasury yield began to rise sharply overnight. Those in the know started to worry- a lot.  The following day, Trump significantly revised some of his tariff policy, citing bond market “queasiness."" This brief primer is designed to help ordinary folks understand the basics and gain the macroeconomic literacy necessary to grasp these times, what may be happening, and why it is so concerning. 

## **What is a Treasury Bond?**

Imagine the U.S. government borrows money from people for 10 years and promises to pay them back with a little extra (interest). That “little extra” is called the yield. A treasury is essentially that. It’s an instrument through which the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a certain period of time.  So the 10-year treasury is a loan the government will repay in 10 years with a bit more.

Let’s say I buy a treasury for $10 and receive $11 back from the government over 10 years. That’s a 10% return over its lifespan, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but approximately 1% per year if simplified. We refer to that as a 1% yield.

Why does selling bonds cause prices to decrease? It's simple: supply and demand, just as selling stocks lowers their prices. When you suddenly sell a large quantity of anything, the price drops because supply exceeds demand.

Now let’s say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment — or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. This translates to about a 3.2% annual return (compounded) — a big jump from the original 1% yield! 

As you can see, when bond prices go down, yields go up — they move inversely.

This is worth emphasizing:  The U.S. always repays the same amount ($11) regardless of how much someone later buys the bond for on the secondary market ($8).

- If the bond sells for $12 later, the U.S. pays back $11.

- If the bond sells for $10 later, the U.S. pays $11.

- If the bond sells for $8 later, the U.S. pays $11.

The reason the yield changes is not due to what the U.S. repays, but because the secondary market buyer paid a different amount for that return.   Making back $11 from a $12, $10, or $8 investment results in different profits, and thus different yields.

Why would someone sell a bond for $8 at a loss that is guaranteed to eventually pay $11 (in 10 years)?  Because they need the $8 now and don't want to wait 10 years for the bond to mature!  Or they might think they can get better than a 3.2% return by investing the money elsewhere.  Just as it makes sense for you to withdraw money from your bank account, even if it's guaranteed to earn you 2% interest, because you need to pay your rent or because you believe you can do better than 2% by YOLO-ing into 0-day TSLA puts.

## **Why Should I Care About the 10-Year Treasury?**

Remember my example where I sold my bond for $8, which caused the yield to rise to 3.2%? Now, when the government needs to borrow money again, it can’t offer the previous 1% yield. Why? Because people can simply buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To stay competitive, the government must raise the interest rate on new bonds to satisfy market demands. As a result, it ends up paying more to borrow money.

Think about it this way:  Imagine you’re a builder in a town called Springville. For years, you’ve successfully sold one-bathroom houses for $100,000. However, Springville has evolved. It's now a family-oriented town, and everyone wants two bathrooms. The one-bathroom homes you previously built are now selling for only $50,000 on the resale market, as buyers realize they will need to spend an additional $50,000 to add a second bathroom.

Here’s the issue: You can’t continue building one-bathroom houses and expect to sell them for $100,000. Buyers won’t be interested. Why would they, when the market values a one-bathroom home at $50,000?

If you want to maintain that $100,000 price tag, you’ll need to provide more value, such as including the second bathroom from the beginning. The same applies to the U.S. Treasury. If it wishes to keep issuing debt, it has to match what the market currently provides. Otherwise, investors will simply look elsewhere.

You might say:  Well, so what? I don’t care what the government pays in interest.  Not my problem!

*Oh, it is very, very much your problem.*

This is because the 10-year treasury yield is a benchmark.  Many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.

So when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow — and so do you.

Higher yields = higher interest rates across the board.

That’s bad for:

- **Homebuyers** – higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments

- **Businesses** – higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand

- **The government** – more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure

- **The stock market** – investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down

Basically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.

It’s a double whammy.

That’s why people watch the health of the treasury market so closely — because it impacts nearly everything in the economy, even if you don’t own a single bond yourself.

## **Why is the 10-Year treasury such an important benchmark?**

I want to say “just because” — but that wouldn’t satisfy you.

It’s not that the 10-year treasury must be the benchmark, but it’s the one everyone watches because it hits the sweet spot.

Treasuries (so far) are considered “risk-free.” They’re backed by the U.S. government and are super liquid. That liquidity and low risk provide the market a ton of real-time data about inflation expectations and the overall cost of capital. So they’re a natural baseline for figuring out what riskier borrowing should cost.

Imagine you have a friend, Randy Reliable, who’s always good for his money. Everyone is willing to loan him money at 2%. He borrows a lot, so there’s plenty of data on what rate people charge him — and you can be confident that 2% is the right baseline.

Then Sam Suspicious comes along and wants to borrow. You don’t know exactly what to charge him, but since you know what Randy pays, you simply add a risk premium to that. That’s how the market treats borrowers — it builds off the known “risk-free” rate.

But why the 10-year treasury specifically? It’s not too short (like a 2-year) or too long (like a 30-year). It captures market expectations about inflation, economic growth, and Fed policy over a medium-to-long horizon, making it the go-to reference point for many long-term loans.

Many countries have their own 10-year bond benchmarks, but Randy Reliable, the U.S. 10-year treasury, remains the gold standard globally.  In Europe, most euro-denominated contracts don’t key off the U.S. treasury. Instead, the German 10-year Bund is the de facto benchmark; it’s seen as the most stable and liquid bond in the Eurozone.  Other examples include:

- UK 10-year Gilt – a common benchmark for domestic British rates.

- Japanese 10-year  – used domestically, though heavily influenced by BOJ policy.

- Chinese 10-year – also exists, but tends to be more policy-driven and less market-transparent.

These bonds exist and are useful, but their reliability and global relevance can vary, especially when markets perceive a government as unstable, opaque, or overly interventionist.

The US 10-year beats these because it checks all the boxes:

- Deep liquidity

- Transparent, market-based pricing

- Long track record of stability

- Dollar dominance — many contracts worldwide are USD-denominated

- Safe-haven status during global crises

When benchmarking global risk, Randy Reliable (aka the U.S. 10Y) remains the handsome, well-dressed guy with a good credit score.  If you benchmark against another country and it suddenly does something wild (Brexit, for example), you get burned. That’s why predictability is essential — investors need confidence, not surprises.

## **So It’s Good to Be Randy Reliable?**

Yes, it is indeed good to be Randy Reliable. The dollar’s position as the global reserve currency grants the U.S. considerable soft power. Countries often avoid financially attacking the U.S. as those actions tend to backfire on their own economies, making economic retaliation against the U.S. both risky and costly.  Additionally, high global demand for U.S. dollars keeps the dollar strong internationally, allowing Americans to purchase foreign goods more affordably.

However, there’s a downside:

A strong dollar also makes American exports more expensive, which can hurt U.S. manufacturers selling abroad.

That’s why undermining the dollar's status as a reserve currency is an unspoken (but nearly essential) goal of Trump's agenda, even if he is not fully aware of it.  Yet, it’s a perilous strategy as it significantly weakens the U.S.  A good article discussing all this can be found here:  https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-trump-could-dethrone-dollar.

## **It All Comes Down to Trust and Predictability?**

Now you’re getting it.  The yield on the 10-year is seen as a key indicator of trust in the U.S. economy and its macroeconomic leadership.

So what if old Randy Reliable develops a ketamine habit and begins threatening his friends?  Well, suddenly he doesn’t seem like such a safe person to lend to. 

This is why the “long part of the curve” for treasuries (i.e., 10-year, 30-year) is often seen as an indicator of the financial health of the United States economy.  Are we Randy Reliable or Randy Reckless?  That’s the question the world is asking right now, and it reflects in the yield curve. Add potential strategic bond selling pressure from China and other countries on top of that, and we have a problem.  I’ll get to that in a bit.

## **The Yield is the Entire Field**

So, putting it all together, the 10-year yield is a key barometer of the health and strength of the U.S. economy and the trust in American economic leadership.  As that trust erodes, folks see the U.S. as a riskier borrower.  So the rates they’re comfortable charging to loan money to the U.S. go up. 

Typically, during periods of financial uncertainty, the yield on 10-year treasuries goes DOWN.  That’s because long treasuries – lending to Randy Reliable – have always been regarded as a safe haven.  Remember, it represents the risk-free rate!  When equities (stocks) weaken, investors usually shift their money into that safe place.  More buyers lead to an increase in the value of treasuries. Because value and yield are inversely related, the 10-year yield declines.

But that’s not what we saw last week!  Instead, while stock prices were falling, the 10-year yield was increasing.  That was… weird.  The markets no longer saw treasuries as their safe haven.  That’s a scary thought.  It implied a market losing faith in the United States and concluding it was actually Randy Reckless. 

## **Wasn’t I Supposed to Be Worried About an Inverted Yield Curve?**

Aren’t higher long-term bond yields a good thing?  You may have heard that an inverted yield curve is a worrisome sign.  That’s when long-term bonds have a lower yield than short-term bonds.  This situation is also anomalous because you would expect longer-term loans to have higher risk.  More time means a greater opportunity for the lender to default or for inflation to wreck you.  This higher risk typically leads to a higher rate of long-term bonds compared to short-term bonds. 

An inverted yield curve is a signal.  It historically signals a recession and is worth monitoring.  Remember, when equities and other investments decline, we expect people to seek safety – like Randy Reliable – leading to a drop in 10-year yields. Therefore, while an inverted yield curve is concerning, it’s still NORMAL. It remains just a signal, not a systemic risk in itself.

Rising 10-year yields during market weakness present a different type of danger: strategic selling by foreign holders or a decline in confidence in U.S. creditworthiness.

That’s not a recession signal. That is the disease.

That’s a sovereign confidence event.

Different animal. Nastier teeth.

## **What Does China, Japan, and Canada Have to do with This?**

Now, China has almost $800 billion in treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more — about $1 trillion.  Canada also has a sizeable holding. These can move markets.

And remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of the total outstanding treasuries, what matters is the float — that is, how much is being bought and sold at any given time. For example, suppose typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now, a real estate mogul decides to sell all of his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That’s a small fraction of all the homes in the city, but it triples the supply for sale. There aren’t enough buyers for that. So, prices drop. A lot.

Even though it’s just a 2% change in total inventory, it’s a huge disruption to normal market activity. Japan, China, and Canada can impact the treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, particularly if others are selling treasuries too, there simply won’t be enough buyers with cash ready, and that’s what we refer to as a liquidity crunch or a low-liquidity situation. Since China is a major buyer of treasuries, it can also influence the demand side by halting its purchases.

## **Bond Market Chess vs. Trade War Checkers**

Conversely, the increase in the 10-year yield last week may have resulted from major sovereign bondholders striking the United States right where it hurts.  They can engage in macroeconomic Bond Market Chess while Trump and the United States play Tariff Checkers.  And China, Japan, and Canada wouldn’t even need to crash the market — just sell slowly and steadily, nudging the long end of the yield curve upward over time. This matches what we are witnessing now. That alone can quietly erode the U.S. economy. Think boiling frog.

The Chinese can then take the capital released from their treasury sales and reinvest it into their domestic economy — infrastructure, industrial policy, and innovation — effectively blunting the impact of a trade war. So, they’re hitting the brakes on us while stepping on the gas at home.

China is smart enough to know this, and they have the tools to do it.  So are Canada and Japan.  Indeed, the current Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, is one of the smartest macroeconomic thinkers out there.  

The dollar’s status as the global reserve currency gives the U.S. immense advantages. But there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and this kind of yield exposure is the price we pay for that privilege. As the saying goes, “With great power comes great responsibility.”

When the U.S. is strong, stable, and globally engaged, the financial pool is too deep for even China and other countries to make a splash. But if we start pulling back from the global economy, undermining our own institutions, and projecting unreliability, that’s when the macroeconomic knives can come out and actually hurt us... a lot. This is particularly true if we, through belligerent economic policies,  encourage other Western or Western-aligned countries to collaborate against American interests.

This is exactly why people like me are warning that Trump’s policies are not only misguided but also economically dangerous, fundamentally undermining American power.

## **Can’t the Fed Do Something?**

Yes and no, but not really.  Yes, the Fed can step in and buy long-term treasuries — that’s what it did during previous rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE).

But there’s a catch: it’s much harder for the Fed to control the long end of the yield curve (10- and 30-year bonds) because those markets are massive and heavily influenced by investor sentiment regarding inflation, growth, and fiscal credibility.

When the Fed buys bonds, it can lower yields. However, doing so aggressively on the long end could send a dangerous signal: that the Fed is suppressing risk in a manner that markets may not deem sustainable.

If the underlying issue is fiscal credibility, QE can backfire — driving up inflation fears and ultimately causing long-term yields to rise instead of fall.

So yes, the Fed can intervene, but doing so risks unmooring inflation expectations, weakening the dollar, and undermining confidence in treasury markets.

## **So Why Not Just Make Those Chinese-Held Bonds Null and Void?**

After reading this primer, many have suggested, why don’t we just declare Chinese-held treasuries null and void? We have the power to take that leverage from them!

No, we do not have that power.  Do you want to crash the entire bond market and cause the US to default on its national debt?  Because that’s how you do it.  This would be an economic catastrophe of the highest order and would make the Great Depression look like a mere blip.

It’s as if someone is out there spreading rumors about your violent tendencies.  So, in retaliation, you publicly punch them in the face. Voiding China’s notes makes about as much sense.  It simply proves exactly what the market was unsure about.    

As an example, suppose you, Charlie, Joan, Peter, and Mary each loan me $10,000.

I decide I hate Peter and tell him I’m not paying back his loan and that I won’t repay it if he sells it to anyone else.  Peter’s loan becomes worthless.  This situation is called a default. 

Charlie, Joan, and Mary all realize that I could easily default on their loans as well.  So, they panic and sell their loans as quickly as they can because now they don’t trust me.

The value of the notes drops to zero or close to it because nobody trusts me to pay them back.

Now, I go out to the market and ask for more loans.  Nobody wants to lend me money except at extortionate rates.

## **What Can We Do?**

Ultimately, fixing this will require a great deal of time and rebuilding trust.  Unfortunately, trust is not something the Fed can print out of thin air, or that the President of the United States can enact through an Executive Order.  Trust comes from relationships and time.

There’s an old adage:  Trust takes decades to build, a moment to lose, and forever to regain.  We are witnessing that in real time.  Restoring trust may well take decades now.  There will be no easy fix.  Hopefully, now that you understand the macroeconomic issues, you can begin the hard work ahead.

The major ‘turning point’ it seemed was when he berated Zelensky at the Oval Office, but more than that, repeated Putin’s own talking points which in some ways is a much more scarier scenario than just him making the typical outrageous claims he does. 

I get that lots of people are saying he’s just making it up as he goes along, but even for a madman, there must be a rationale, which for him, is exclusively self-serving, but how exactly in his mind does this benefit him if the stock markets crash / country goes into recession?

About 10 years about I randomly bought $800 in Nvidia. Today it's worth about $240,000. This is by far the biggest win I've ever had and is AMAZING. I've stuck it out through the big ups and downs with this stock, and am glad I did. But the longer I'm in, and the more it grows, the more I fear a loss. I'm looking for advice/perspective on what to do with this stock and if/when to sell. Here are the relevant pieces of information:

* I'm late 30's, so I still have a decent runway for investing for retirement, though I'm working to retire early.
* My Nvidia stock represents almost half my current portfolio. Having that large of a percentage in one stock makes me nervous.
* I feel like I should sell some Nvidia (not all) to simply diversify my portfolio, but the longer I stay in... the more I've made. And of course there are so many predictions out there on where this stock will go. So it feels like that is a bad choice.
* Edit to add: this is in a taxable brokerage account

What would you do? Stay on the Nvidia roller coaster? Sell all? Sell some (how much)? Other pieces of advice???

Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

1iotckq,2025-02-13,2025-02-13 15:56:47,Need an explanation on Trumps latest salvo of Tariffs,"I am asking an honest question and would like an honest answer.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-news-conference.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-news-conference.html)

""“They charge us a tax or tariff and we charge them,” Trump said during a press event in Oval Office.

The president said that under the plan, the U.S. will treat other countries’ non-tariff policies as unfair trade practices that warrant tariffs in response.

Those include value-added taxes, or VATs, and other practices that the office of the U.S. trade representative deems to be unfair trade limitations.""

Has Trump's mental acuity disappeared? I am asking honestly. For VAT's are added to all products bought locally. Meaning if I buy in Germany, then regardless of product sourcing you pay a VAT. If I buy in Germany, and export to Switzerland I don't pay the German VAT, but pay the Swiss VAT.

Meaning this is not a tariff against anybody. How is this unfair? It is literally 100% fair because it applies to ALL products. People critiqued Biden for his ageism (fair enough), but this thought process seriously takes the cake.

Hence why I would like an honest answer of what Trump is trying to achieve?

EDIT: It was said this has nothing to do with investing. In fact it has everything to do with investing. I am a contrarian and as such look for opportunities. However with Trump making these decisions I have decided to sit back and start cashing out. The problem is that all, I repeat all stocks have long tail risk.

1igiac0,2025-02-03,2025-02-03 00:49:46,Why Tarrifs Might Not Actually Happen on Tuesday,"I'm calling b******* on Trump's supposed tariffs that he's going to implement on Tuesday. Something about it has always seemed fishy to me and below is my analysis of why it probably won't occur on Tuesday.


*   **The Oddity of Tuesday Implementation**: I find it strange that the tariffs are set to take effect on a Tuesday, not immediately. This delay creates an ""optionality"" for Trump, leaving room for other events to occur. If Trump is serious about imposing tariffs, then it would make sense to do it immediately, however, the delay to Tuesday doesn't allow enough time for the economy to find alternative sources of supply. Here are some possible reasons:

    *   **Market Reaction**: The delay allows Trump to observe the market's reaction on Monday. If the markets react very negatively then maybe Trump would want a way out.

    *   **Judge Intervention**: The delay may allow a judge to step in and block the tariffs, giving Trump a way to say he did what he promised but was stopped by the ""deep state."" This way, Trump can fulfill his promise and blame someone else for not being able to fully carry it out.

     *   **Covering Short Positions**: Trump might need Monday to allow a fund to cover a short position, which would be a bet that the market would go down. After this happens, he or a fund associated with him could then buy up those same positions after the market dip.

  *    **Delay and Control:** If Trump was serious about the tariffs, they would have been implemented immediately. The delay is indicative of a desire to have more control over the narrative and potentially profit from the volatility created by the tariffs.


*   **Why Not Act Immediately?** If Trump truly believed in the efficacy or necessity of the tariffs, he would have implemented them right away, maybe even on Sunday or Monday morning. If he were concerned about a judge blocking the tariffs, his style would be to put them in place immediately and then let the judge try to overturn them. The fact that he's waiting until Tuesday is ""telling"" and suggests that there is something else going on.


*  **The Petty Argument**: Trump may be motivated by a dislike for the left-leaning governments of Canada and Mexico, which could be a reason for the higher tariff rates applied to them, compared to China. Kind of like ""sticking it to the libs"". There is a nationalistic argument for the tariffs, but the higher rates on Canada and Mexico don't make sense.


*   **Market Manipulation**: Trump is creating the volatility that he can profit from, and since he pretty much owns the justice department and the SEC, they won't investigate.


*   **A Bloodbath on Monday:** A ""bloodbath"" in the markets on Monday opens and an even bigger one on Tuesday when the tariffs are supposed to go into effect. The market's reaction may cause Trump to look for a way out of the tariffs.


TLDR: In essence, Trump's actions, particularly the delay in implementing the tariffs until Tuesday, are not about standard policy or even national interest. Rather, they might be part of a larger scheme for personal gain, political maneuvering, and a way to solidify his power.

1jdpo9l,2025-03-17,2025-03-17 18:24:07,"Pepsi (PEP) buys probiotic soda Poppi for $1.95 billion to expand their presence in the functional soda market, paying 13x+ topline revenue","**Shares of Pepsi closed 1.85% up today. Some information about Poppi, the acquisition target.**

\- Founded in 2018 by a couple, they reported upwards of $100 million in sales in 2024. Even if we round up to $150 million in sales, Pepsi would be paying a 13x multiple on top line revenue not net profit. Realistically 19.5x top line revenue on the $100 million reported if we don't use the rounded up $150 million figure.

\- The company previously appeared on Shark Tank and sold 25% of the business to Rohan Oza for a $400,000 investment. Rohan Oza is a businessman known for his success in bringing drink brands such as Vita Coco and Vitaminwater to market

\- The company has a wide range of marketing partnerships with celebrities including Post Malone, Hailey Bieber, Kylie Jenner, Billie Eilish, Russell Westbrook, Jennifer Lopez and Olivia Munn

\- Poppi was previously sued in California class action lawsuit for misleading consumers about the health benefits of their drinks. With only 2g of fiber, a consumer would have to drink 4+ cans to ""realize any potential health benefits""

**Interested to hear what people think about this acquisition.**

\- Is Poppi overvalued and did Pepsi overpay?

\- Should Pepsi have built the internal capabilities to build a brand like this rather than acquiring? Does acquiring show a lack of direction and vision by management? It's hard to imagine that with Pepsi's scale in manufacturing, marketing, retail partnerships, etc. it have cost more than $1.95 billion to make a competing offering that could reach $100 million in sales within 6 years.

\- Naturally my next thought was, given the above on valuation, is the Poppi brand worth almost $2 billion? Maybe it's not the sales they are after, but the formulation, the brand, or the marketing partnerships.

\- Will Pepsi change the formula, leading to turning off long time customers?

1lydkcj,2025-07-12,2025-07-12 18:58:13,"Thoughts on the Trump Account, aka ""Baby Bonds"", recently passed into law?","Starting July 2026, parents will be able to contribute $5,000 per year into an IRA for any child under 18 that will be invested in US equities. For U.S. citizens born between Jan 1st 2025 and Dec 31st 2028 the U.S. government will deposit an initial $1,000 to seed the account.   

If fully funded for all 18 years, the child will have $90k principle invested, most likely it'll be around \~150k accounting for inflation and growth. 

There's some interesting thoughts about doing Roth conversions after age 18 when the child will now be in college and probably in a low income brackets till age 23. 

For most middle class families this will be another tax-advantaged space they won't be able to take advantage of or it'll compete for the same dollars that could otherwise be invested in a 529 plan.   
  
For those families that do have the resources, it appears that Trump accounts can effectively function as a stealth Roth IRA account that will essentially grow tax free till retirement (\~$3 million in today's dollars by age 65).   
  
There's still a lot of questions to be answered over the next 12 months before this becomes available; what type of ETFs or funds parents can choose from, expense ratios, participating institutions, ability to do rollovers or conversions, etc...

1ivbhvr,2025-02-22,2025-02-22 00:25:40,Here is why stocks beat rentals,"Today I was visiting the different rentals I have and while in the car did a lot of analyzing rentals versus stocks. Since the topic comes up frequently I will give my thoughts. 

Example rental I have. $40k purchase price, $750/mo rent. This is a great deal by all metrics. This is essentially a 2% rule deal which is unheard of.

Taxes $100/mo, insurance $100/mo, maintenance $100/mo, lawn care and miscellaneous $100/mo. Anyone who knows Realestate knows $100 a month doesn’t really cover major capex but let’s go with it. 

Net is essentially $350/mo or about $4k a year on $40k. 10% not bad. I can probably increase rent 5% a year, the property will increase 5% a year. and let’s say I hold for 30 years. 

After 30 years I made give or take $200k in rent and the property is worth $165k. And my annual rent will be about $18k now. 


$40k in BTI stock right now would pay you $3,200 a year in dividends. If you reinvest all dividends for 30y, they increase dividends 5% and the share appreciates 3%…

My shares are worth $234k, I made a total of $155k in dividends, I’m receiving $24k annually from dividends. 

A few things not taken into consideration include the ability to use leverage which can increase returns but also increase risk, alternatively the work required to maintain a rental. No management fees have been included as well. 

Now take all this into consideration, the likelihood or effort of finding a 2% deal, the work required, the liquidity of both, and the fact that I didn’t account for major capex and you can clearly see which is the better option.

Now, it seems the U.S. is heading into a recession—if it isn't already in one—and at this point, nobody knows how severe it might become.

2.) If Trump announced tomorrow that the U.S. would stop paying interest on Treasuries held by China for example, absolutely nobody would be surprised.

1jevent,2025-03-19,2025-03-19 08:05:31,Retail investors ditch buy-the-dip mentality during the market correction,"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/18/investors-ditch-buy-the-dip-mindset-as-market-corrects-but-dont-capitulate.html


Individual investors, whose assets are more tied to the stock market than ever, have abandoned their tried-and-true dip-buying mentality as the S&P 500

recently fell into a painful, 10% correction.

Retail outflows from U.S. equities rose to about $4 billion over the past two weeks as tariff chaos and mounting economic concerns caused a three-week pullback in the S&P 500, according to data from Barclays. During March’s sell-off, 401(k) holders have been aggressively trading their investments, to the tune of four times the average level, according to Alight Solutions’ data going back to the late 1990s.

“If people were trying to buy the dip and get their stocks on sale, maybe you would see people actually buying large-cap equities. But instead we see people selling from large cap-equities,” said Rob Austin, director of research at Alight Solutions. “So this does appear to be a bit of a reactionary trading activity.”

The increased selling came as American households are more sensitive than ever to the turbulence in the stock market. U.S. household ownership of equities has reached a record level, amounting to nearly half their financial assets, according to Federal Reserve data.

Dip-buying had served investors well over the past two years as Main Street rode the artificial intelligence-inspired bull market to record highs. At one point, the S&P 500 went more than 370 days without even a 2.1% sell-off, the longest such stretch since the global financial crisis of 2008-09.

But lately, markets began to sour as President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariffs and sudden changes in policy stirred up volatility, stoking fears of dampened consumer spending, slower economic growth, weaker profits and maybe even a recession. The S&P 500 officially entered a correction late last week, and is now sitting some 8.7% below its February all-time high.

Still, retail traders are far from throwing in the towel. For example, the net debit of margin accounts, a “popular proxy for retail investors’ sentiment,” continues to stay elevated, according to Barclays data.

“There is plenty of room for retail investors to further disengage from the equity market,” analysts led by Venu Krishna, Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy, said in a note Tuesday to clients. “We are of the view that retail investors have in no way capitulated.”

Barclays’ proprietary euphoria indicator shows sentiment has been brought down to levels similar to where it was around the time of the U.S. presidential election in November, but is still high by historic standards.

“It’s not like everybody is going out there saying the sky is falling. Most people, it looks like, are not making any sort of reactions,” Austin said.

If you invested your money into one index for 30 years that first dollar will have grown by the multiple below. I show two periods the last 30 years, and the 30 years before that:

Period #1 (1995-2025): S&P 500 - 7.6x | Dow Jones - 10.1x | **Nasdaq - 21.7x** ([plot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgRe1DDKrRvQFzPZaBTs4kUKH2D1k8EPflAY7JsAcBi2635-891Q3PSTL_eMIaVXK-CMGH2c6TP2tw/pubchart?oid=97885568&format=interactive))

Period #2 (1965-1995): S&P - 5.7x | Dow Jones - 4.6x | **Nasdaq - 8.1x** (plot: [plot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgRe1DDKrRvQFzPZaBTs4kUKH2D1k8EPflAY7JsAcBi2635-891Q3PSTL_eMIaVXK-CMGH2c6TP2tw/pubchart?oid=1857506659&format=interactive))

Nasdaq does better. Why are we generally piling into VOO or SPY instead of QQQ or ONEQ?

(I also understand that it doesn't make sense to factor invest into a market exchange, of all things, but what about it makes it more performant over our one true love S&P 500?)



\----  
Edit #1: The astute have pointed out, I cherry picked 2 periods. I ran the rolling/slider analysis and plotted here: [plot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgRe1DDKrRvQFzPZaBTs4kUKH2D1k8EPflAY7JsAcBi2635-891Q3PSTL_eMIaVXK-CMGH2c6TP2tw/pubchart?oid=467475738&format=interactive).

It's a little confusing because all the data is being transformed on itself (and rolled into a single number), but here's the interpretation: X-axis represents your ""present day"" and you started investing 30yrs prior to that. Your gains (as a multiple) are shown on the Y-axis above. The chart as a whole represents 60yrs of investing.

\- The Nasdaq wins out fairly significantly, 20x on average, to S&P's \~7x.

\- The Dow and S&P are much older so the data's valid through all the dates we're looking at; the Nasdaq needed to be clipped at 2001 (opened in 1971).

\- Dividends are not included, but someone let me know how to estimate adding 3% (vs 1%) dividends to the total returns and compare that to 20x vs 7x multiples.

They left their money in citibank their entire lives collecting virtually no interest at all (not even a HYSA, just a regular savings account that they only earn like $10 of interest a month), and of course never owned any stocks, ETF's, mutual funds or never even did any CD's at a bank.

1kb4bkz,2025-04-29,2025-04-29 21:12:12,Financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to the S&P 500 the day after tomorrow,"Container volumes at the port of Los Angels are down this week. They'll be down farther next week. We know this because arrivals are scheduled in advance and crossing the ocean by boat takes awhile. Container volumes at east coast ports are expected to do the same thing, but on a delayed schedule, because ""Shanghai, through the Panama Canal to New York City"" is a longer trip than ""Shanghai to Los Angels"".

And because of *that*, it's a safe bet truckers will have trouble finding work next month. Large-scale retail layoffs seem likely to follow soon thereafter. Very little can be done to stop this, because even if the tariffs on China were lifted tomorrow, it takes 3-7 weeks to get merchandise from a Chinese port to an American retail store. (Plus, I feel pretty confident saying the tariffs on China won't be lifted any time soon.)

A natural question when you hear this is, ""if that's true, why isn't the stock market down more?"" And I think a lot of the answer to this question can be summed up as: **hardly anyone is paid to care.**

I was going to title this post ""financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to your index funds the day after tomorrow"", but the **index fund providers** *are* paid to care... in the sense that they are paid to care about minimizing tracking error. They are paid to make sure that when the index goes up X%, the fund captures those games, and when the index goes down Y%, the fund doesn't do any worse than that. But they aren't paid to know whether the index will be up or down tomorrow. And this is not a criticism! It's not their job.

Who's job is it? For **high-frequency traders**, it's pretty much the opposite of their job. Their job is to do a trade and unwind it a few milliseconds later at a penny-per-share profit. And some of the hate HFTs get strikes me as overwrought; before HFTs were skimming a penny a share off every trade, floor traders were skimming 12½ cents (because stock prices used to be quoted in eighths of a dollar). But HFTs definitely don't care about what's going to happen to the trucking industry next month.

Now, despite what you may have heard, HFTs aren't the *entire* stock market. HFTs like to do small, quick trades. So instead, if somebody wants to sell half a million shares of TSLA, they might call around to various **dealers** and ask for quotes. The dealers will quote numbers below what an HFT would pay for *ten* shares of TSLA, but hopefully high enough that the seller agrees to the deal, and then the dealers will need to sell the stock to someone else, and that can't be done in a matter of milliseconds. Maybe they unwind their position over the course of 24 hours. So when the dealer gives a quote, they might be thinking about what the market could do tomorrow—but they hope that by the day after tomorrow it will be somebody else's problem.

Okay, but those are the middle-men. What about **professional stock-pickers**, active mutual fund managers, long-short hedge fund managers? Unfortunately, they also aren't paid to care what the S&P 500 will do the day after tomorrow. Managers of actively managed mutual funds care how they do compared to their benchmark, which is generally an index. If the index is down, that's fine, as long as *their* stocks are down less (or perhaps realistically, for risk-averse managers, aren't down significantly more). Meanwhile, a long-short hedge fund, which buys some stocks while shorting others, wants to be able to tell its investors that whether the broad market is up or down will have *no effect whatsoever* on the fund's performance.

So yes, actively managed mutual funds and long-short hedge funds are going to take a longer-term view of stocks they are thinking of buying or selling. And yes, they will care if companies could be affected by tariffs more than others. But even if they start to suspect *every* company should be down as a result of tariffs, they're not going to smash a big red button labeled ""sell everything"", because that's not their job.

Maybe it's *somebody's* job to care, but honestly it's hard to come up with a good business model based around that sort of thing. If you realize a crash is coming, but get the timing wrong, you could lose a lot of money—like if you went all-in shorting the market in 1999, when the dot-com bubble wouldn't burst until the following year. And if get the timing of *this* crash right because you bothered to look up how fast freight moves, how does that let you correctly time the next crash? It's not a lot to build a career on.

Hell, it's one thing to know about freight schedules, another thing to predict when the *market* will notice. It could crash tomorrow on bad first-quarter GDP numbers, or it might remain up until there are headlines about truckers unable to find work, or maybe it will take actual pictures of empty store shelves for the reality to sink in. And I certainly don't claim to know how badly the US will manage to drag the rest of the world economy down with it, which is why my money's in a mix of international stocks and international bonds, rather than simply one or the other.

What I can tell you is this: unfortunately, you can't assume surely *somebody* would do something about it, if there were a totally predictable crash incoming. Nobody else has as much of a financial interest in what happens to your savings as you do.

1jconf8,2025-03-16,2025-03-16 11:59:47,Felons are not allowed to own stocks???,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some help here. I was recently released from prison after serving 6 years for distribution of cannabis. 

Before I went in I had a brokerage account with Wells Fargo. When I came home about a month ago I had a lot of notifications that my account needed to either be liquidated and closed or transferred to another institution immediately. 

I tried fidelity but they don’t accept felons. 
Another felon I know tried robinhood but they don’t accept felons. A friend recommended Chase because they have a policy where they hire people with adverse backgrounds, so I called Chase and spoke with two different advisors and they confirmed that, yes that is JP Morgan Chase’s policy and they confirmed that there would be no issue with me opening a brokerage account. 

So I opened an account and I even had a senior advisor in the escalations department make a three way phone call with me to the Wells Fargo advisor to confirm to Wells Fargo that the ACAT was legitimate and so Wells Fargo could lift the restrictions off my account to complete the transfer. After the phone call, it took about 2-3 days for the ACAT to go through and I had a fully functioning brokerage account. 

I began adding more legitimate funds through a bank transfer and bagan buying stocks and ETFs. I woke up this morning with an email that said I had an important account notification. I opened my account to check the notification and it said that “after further review” JP Morgan Chase has decided to discontinue services with me and have given me until May 12th to liquidate my account or transfer my positions to another institution. 

I believe that FINRA has rules about felons having brokerage accounts and it seems that every banking institution is associated with FINRA. Does anyone have ideas of what I can do? 

I considered opening a trust and making my sister the trustee and listing myself as the beneficiary. There has to be someway to be invested in the market. If not, I’ll be relegated to 2.5% CDs and my finances are screwed the rest of my life. Any advice helps, thanks!


EDIT: yes I do have a secondary money laundering charge as well for paying my home mortgage with suspected proceeds from my drug crime. I was just focusing on the “being a felon” part of this situation and not the specific individual charges. There seems to have been no problem “opening accounts,” it’s when I fund the accounts (with 100% legitimate funds with records going back 30 years when I was born) that there is a trigger to the legal departments and I get banned.

Second Edit: I guess I should have been more clear. None of the firms that have debanked me, Wells Fargo, Fidelity, now Chase, have specifically claimed that money laundering was the issue, they only claimed that their decision was based on a felony conviction. So I apologize that thinking the felony conviction was my problem and not the specific charge!

1ipc0be,2025-02-14,2025-02-14 09:39:59,"January Retail Sales Drop, Pointing to Possible Economic Slowdown","January saw a sharp pullback in consumer spending, suggesting a potential slowdown in economic growth, according to a Commerce Department report released Friday. Retail sales dropped 0.9% for the month, following an upwardly revised 0.7% gain in December.. Much worse than the expected 0.2% dip. These figures are adjusted for seasonality but not inflation, which rose 0.5% during the month.

Excluding auto sales, retail spending fell 0.4%, missing the forecasted 0.3% increase. A critical “control” measure, used to calculate GDP by stripping out nonessential categories, dropped 0.8%, erasing the previous month’s 0.8% gain.

Since consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, this decline raises concerns about weaker growth in the first quarter.

**Key Figures:**

* **Sporting goods, music, and bookstores**: -4.6%
* **Online retail**: -1.9%
* **Motor vehicles and parts**: -2.8%
* **Gas stations & food & drink**: +0.9%

The data suggests consumer momentum may be fading, leaving myself and probably many others wondering how the economy will fare moving forward.

1k2fxu9,2025-04-18,2025-04-18 17:18:43,A Chinese Deflationary Tsunami Is Headed For Europe,"Hi guys, 

I didn't want to make a post but I can't find a discussion thread on this.  I found this article on The Site That Dare Not Speak Its Name. The article is pay-walled but it is probably on archive by now.  This is the short and sweet:  

Executive Summary

*  The textbook impact of the world’s largest goods importer, the US, imposing an ultra-high tariff on the world’s largest goods exporter, China, is for global goods prices to fall.   

*  Thereby, while Trump’s tariffs will be inflationary for the US they will be deflationary for Europe.

*  Go long euro rates (EONIA futures) versus US rates (Fed fund futures) June 2026 contracts.  

*  Overweight European government bonds versus US Treasuries, with the top pick being UK gilts.  

*  Stay overweight the European versus US stock market, until the US valuation premium unwinds from its current 50 percent to a ‘fair value’ 25 percent.  

I haven't heard this idea before.  Isn't it more likely that everybody will boost tariffs everywhere?  It looks to me like the EU is being attacked by China.  This is pure mercantilism. Right?    Is this analysis fundamentally correct? Tariffs cause deflation, by definition, right? Look at the great depression, for example.

1ny8yig,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 19:32:37,Do stock valuation metrics matter?,"Hi, I'm new to investment from EU.

I recently learned about stock valuation measures such as P/B, P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and more. However, I started to feel like these traditional stock valuation metrics do not really provide useful insights in fast-growing companies nowadays and which one to invest. For instance, the current stock price valuations on tech companies such as Tesla, Palantir, Nebius, AST Space, and IonQ are not justified by the metrics IMO. It seems like to me that the majority of the tech companies have very high premium price solely judged by the valuation metrics. Perhaps, it's just all about the AI, EV, and future technology hype, but their stock prices have been growing fast long enough even though people pointed out they are overvalued years ago. I don't think that professional investors are dumber than some random dudes using yahoo finance or seeking alpha and ignore all those numbers...  

As I see, qualitative properties (e.g, market trend, product outlook) have much stronger influence on the stock price. I'm not sure if I should be less concerned about the metrics and be more focused on what company does and the current market trend.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**1. Fake analyst ratings**  
  
Quantum Companies like **Quantum Computing Inc** (**QUBT**) have recently gotten a new promotional analyst rating from ""**Ascendiant Capital**"", raising their target from **22 usd** to **40 usd**. Now I know that these fake analyst ratings are normal within small-cap companies but once companies enter the 1 billion+ market cap, don't these companies automatically become subject to all the **SEC** rules and therefore this could be considered fraud even though **Ascendiant** discloses that it was a paid analyst rating? I'm not too sure on this but I asked ChatGPT and it said yes, and it gave me a wild theory, that they do this because of the government shutdown and the fact that 90% of the **SEC** is off on leave. (idk if this is true, but sounds absolutely insane and just maybe insane enough to be true). This conversely sent the stock flying and generated headlines on both Yahoo finance and tradingview.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**2. Dilution and Liquidity**  
  
2 weeks ago (15-18th of september) the vice president of **QUBT** sold off **100%** or **400.000** of his shares. October 1st **QUBT** diluted further 25m shares into the pool, and even though the market should have been bearish it ended up sending the stock flying up 25% in the first 30 mins of trading because of a short squeeze (i think).  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**3. Big cashout???**  
  
Everyone knows they're a scam, they pivoted from beverages to quantum and now sell vaporware. They already have several SEC filings against them and one for fraud would be detrimental. Could this rally just be in order to make sure there's sufficient liquidity for a cashout, now that their market cap is 4b+?

I'll give some quick context before, but if you're not interested you can skip to the bottom part! :) 

I am currently 19 years old and am trying to get into investing. I had a rough period but recently I learned to live life a bit healthier etc and also to manage my money a lot better. I still study, but work on the side every now and then as well, which gives me a small, but stable income. I'm planning on investing €200/month, with a self created trading plan. To start it off, I will be transfering all the money I have put in crypto's as well. (rn its about €1.8k, with 80% of profits, i put in €1k) so in short: DCA ing €200/month with a starting of almost €2k. 

I will be trying to get a portfolio for the very long term as I am still young, with relatively secure, small profits yearly, looking for like 5-10% a year on average (tell me if that's too ambitious pls). I have three questions however. 

TL;DR

1) I live in Belgium. Does anyone have suggestions for which trading platform I should use? I've been looking into trade republic, degiro, bux and interactive brokers. Right now I don't really know which one suits my plan better. any suggestions are welcome

2) My current Idea isn't extremely concrete yet, but at least its something :)   
\- 65% ETFs with 40% of worldwide ETF's, 10% emerging markets, 10% tech and 5% clean energy  
\- 20% Obligations  
\- 10% REIT (if possible with the brokers)  
\- 5% cash/gold   
Any feedback on this? better ideas or things you want to tell me? Goal is to get about an average of 5-10% profit yearly, accumulating 

3) Is it a good idea to start investing with my plan in about 2 weeks, or should I wait? I feel like the markets have been doing very well lately and I would hate to get in at the ATH's and see everything going down when the AI bubble pops. I've been reading a lot about it and I see what people mean by saying that.

I have crunched the numbers. I have made my projections. I am aware of the pitfalls of ""coasting"". 

But, I want to hear your takes on this 

46 years old. 1.35 mil in investable assets - all Roth IRA and 401k. 450k left on the mortgage of a house that would sell for 2.2 mil..

I work 7 on 7 off night shift.  It's an intense schedule. In addition, I pick up 22-24 extra night shifts per year. Doing that, I can max out my 401k plus get an employer match of ~13k a year n 

So, would YOU pick up additional 25 ten hour day shifts per year just so you could also put in additional 15k into Roth (mega backdoor) account? 

Retirement goal is 62. Or maybe to part-time at 62 for a few years

Like the title suggests im in this for the long run 25-30 years and ive been doing some light research for the past couple days when i have time and have come to a conclusion that i want to start investing in the future of AI and robotics as they both obviously have huge potential that we are even starting to see today. 

I have chosen some stocks, i wont give my reasoning here yet as i still havent decided to pull the trigger on if i will start investing in them as i have deeper research into each company to do but i wanted to see what more experienced investors might think about the portfolio and what advice could be given in which to potentially not take and why or even why i should pick alternative stocks. 

The stocks im thinking of investing in and in what percentages are:
VUSA 60%
Tesla 9%
Nvidia 8%
Palantir 6%
Richtech robotics 5% (really on the fence) 
AMD 4% 
ASML 4% 
Broadcom 4%

1nxpsq3,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 05:49:03,Is the Al Lending Boom Innovation or a Hidden Bubble?,"From what I know, I think the surge of capital into Al-enabled fintech, which led global funding to hit $100B in Q3 is less about consumer-facing genius and more about enterprise solutions fixing massive systemic problems, but this focus introduces a major hidden risk.

The facts driving this investment I think is:

1) VCs Target Enterprise: Over 80% of Al-enabled fintech funding goes to enterprise-focused startups because Al is solving complex legacy problems like accounting, data compliance, and risk profiling. Enterprise applications are receiving a majority of VC deal value (around 74.6% in 2025).

2) Al is primarily accelerating credit scoring and risk assessment. This allows fintechs to approve more loans with fewer risks than traditional models, making lending one of the most significant investment sectors.

3) As Al models become ""black boxes"" of complex data, the key challenge shifts to regulatory compliance and liability. If an opaque Al lending model introduces bias or failure, the risk of legal action and capital loss dramatically increases.

The conclusion is clear: the substantial capital inflow is driven by measurable efficiency gains, but it comes with a proportional rise in unseen risk.

I've laid out the data which I had got now I want your pov for the collective read: Is the bigger ""funding pain"" the challenge of accessing these high-value, exclusive enterprise deals, or is it the challenge of vetting the long-term, hidden compliance and liability risk of the Al models themselves?

Let's discuss solutions for adapting to this new diligence standard.

However, I have a special needs child who I want to leave my investment to when I pass so he can live off the annual returns. 
My plan is to travel a lot between retirement time age 60 to age 70 and cut down significantly on expenses at age 70. I am hoping I will not need more than 5% of my return on investment to supplement my income. I will have a good health plan with my pension and will be paying around $1400 mortgage. 

My question is with this plan, can I still leave at least the 500k investment for my special needs son? For those who have retired for a while, which age range is the most expensive during retirement?

My mortgage will last another 10 years after retirement at 60. No car payments. My monthly expenses is about $5200 inclusive of mortgage payments. I have no debts.

Fed won't usually use the word stagflation publicly because it has heavy negative weight in markets last major U.S stagflation was the 1970s). Instead, they phrase it in softer terms like ""deteriorating"" or ""imbalanced risks
And today AGAIN  Fed's Goolsbee said We are seeing both sides of Fed's mandate ""deteriorate"".

This looks like a stagflation warning in disguise.
That combination stagflation risk (weak growth + sticky inflation
Fed's dual mandate price stability (inflation) and maximum employment.

If both sides are deteriorating, it suggests:
Inflation may not be under control (price stability weakening).

Labor market may be softening (unemployment risk rising)

tracking my actual behavior. Was checking my portfolio obsessively and making impulsive trades during every market swing.

Decided to try automated strategies as an experiment in removing emotions from investing. Took some research to find platforms I trusted but eventually connected my accounts and stepped back. 6 months later the results speak for themselves. Account is up 23% compared to 9% during the same period last year when I was actively managing everything. Fewer trades but way better timing and execution.

More importantly learned how much mental energy constant portfolio monitoring was consuming. Didn't realize how stressed I was until I stopped checking prices every hour. Work focus improved, relationship with family got better, started exercising regularly again. Biggest surprise was how much better the automated system handled market volatility. During the October selloff I would have panic sold everything. Instead the system kept executing strategies and recovered quickly while I slept peacefully.

Took about a month to break the habit of obsessive checking. Had to delete broker apps from my phone temporarily. Now I review performance maybe twice per week maximum. Still maintaining some individual stock positions for fun but the bulk of serious money is automated now. Scratches the stock picking itch without jeopardizing systematic returns.

So on one hand I know I can't lose by taking profit, especially that amount, a 200% gain, and that it is risky to stay in on a single company that I know nothing about.

On the other hand, I'm young, and can afford to be risky. Especially since the money invested in that stock was all part of my wants budget in the first place.

Not sure what to do. I'm contributing 840 dollars a month to my fidelity account - total value of 17k, but only 3.5k in my money market position (liquid). I don't regret it yet, but up until like April if this year, I kept buying more stocks, contributing more to FXAIX, the tech ETF, and planet labs. Last time I bought was when the market tanked with the whole tariff thing, which, in hindsight, was a pretty baller move on my end I must say.

But my point is I want to finish my emergency fund first. While I have a really stable job, extra piece of mind doesn't hurt",0,12,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nx0e50/when_do_you_know_to_take_profits/,new,Unknown,0.22

I contribute 16% of my paycheck to that company 401k. With my remaining savings I first invest into a Roth IRA through through fidelity until it hits the yearly cap.

* Netflix stock NFLX fell 2.4% Wednesday, a rare stumble on a day when the S&P 500 notched a record close above 6,700. One thing might be behind the fall – a post from a billionaire.
* Tesla boss Elon Musk echoed boycott calls, writing on X: “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids,” targeting the pro-transgender messaging of the animated series Dead End: Paranormal Park.
* The selloff may not be directly linked to his comments – stocks don’t usually move on culture-war tweets alone – but markets aren’t exactly immune to Musk’s megaphone either.

**Boycott Fears or Just Noise?**

* Investors might be quietly wondering whether this morphs into something bigger.After all, Netflix is no stranger to political or cultural backlash – though historically, it shrugs these off.
* Streaming is sticky. Cancel campaigns have rarely translated into a sustained drop in subscribers, especially given Netflix’s scale and diversified content library.
* Still, even the perception of reputational risk can move a stock in the short term, particularly when traders are hunting for reasons in an otherwise bullish tape.

**Bigger Picture Still Strong**

* Context: Netflix shares are up 32% this year, well ahead of the S&P 500’s 14% gain, proving investors see the platform as resilient in choppy macro conditions.
* Growth levers like ad-supported tiers, password-sharing crackdowns, and global expansion continue to fuel optimism, even if one-off controversies grab headlines.
* Musk’s post may not ding the fundamentals, but it added a twist to a day when Netflix underperformed while the rest of Big Tech marched higher.",0,3,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwvl68/nflx_netflix_stock_sheds_24_was_it_because_of/,new,Unknown,0.39
1nwvgqn,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 06:32:30,FX/crypto investing or speculation?,"Most of my money is in ETFs and individual stocks, which I think of as “real investing.” I try to stick to long-term strategies, diversify, and avoid chasing hype. Lately, though, I’ve been dabbling with a small FX and BTC account, mostly out of curiosity and to experiment with shorter-term trading strategies. The thing is, it feels very different from the stock/ETF world. The speed, the volatility, the way positions can swing in a matter of minutes or hours, it’s almost a completely different mindset.

Because of that, I’ve been wondering: should a small FX or crypto account really count as investing, or is it just pure speculation? On one hand, you’re still putting capital to work, analyzing charts or economic indicators, and managing risk. On the other hand, the risk-reward profile and time horizon feel totally different from traditional investing.

I’m curious how other people approach this. Do you treat FX or crypto accounts as a legitimate part of your portfolio, or is it just a side hobby, almost like gambling but with more structure? And for those who do include it in their portfolio, how do you reconcile the extreme volatility with your broader investment strategy?

I’m interested in hearing different perspectives because I’m trying to figure out where I stand. Does it make sense to classify FX/BTC as investing if the account is small and experimental, or is it better to mentally separate it from my long-term ETF/stock holdings?",1,8,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwvgqn/fxcrypto_investing_or_speculation/,new,Unknown,0.57
1nwuua0,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 05:55:26,Realistic 10-year S&P 500 Returns,"**Are 10% annual returns realistic for the next decade?**  
Most investors on the internet talks about the expected 10% annual return, based on historical returns.  
But is that true for the market today?

Historically the market is much cheaper than today, many investors seem not to care about valuations, and think AI will make explosive growth which will justify current valuations. However, we have a P/E over 31, and a Shiller P/E over 40, history tells us this won't end pretty.

Lets look at the numbers and model out the scenarios, to see what we can expect for returns.  
For this model we need a low, medium and high terminal P/E (what P/E will the S&P 500 end at in 10 years)  
and we need low, medium and high estimated earnings growth numbers.

Historically P/E has a median of 15, this is too low since it goes back to the 1800s, but in the past 50 years, the P/E median is \~20, in the past 20 and 10 years, it's \~25.

So let's go with:

* low: 20
* mid: 25
* high: 30

For growth estimations I looked at the past 20 years of earnings, 50% of the years were below or equal to 4% CAGR, which means this is most likely, and 20% of the years were above or equal to 8% CAGR.

To give some room for more expected growth, let's go with:

* low: 4%
* mid: 6.5%
* high 10% (only seen 4 times since 1880)

*(Note: these aren’t conservative.)*

We now can get the terminal value:

Terminal value = current EPS \* (expected growh rate)\^10 years  
current EPS = 219.52

From here we can see what Compounded Annual Growth Rate will get to the current share price from the terminal value in 10 years. For my estimations I get the following annual returns from the estimations:

* high: \~9% annual return
* mid: \~4.7% annual return
* low: \~1% annual return

This shows another picture of what is preached about 10% annual returns.

**Before the AI bulls comment, please read the section in my article about AI.**

The S&P 500 is priced for perfection. But perfection almost never happens. At current valuations, investors are betting on a decade of above-average growth. Growth that history tells us is unlikely to materialize, and the assumptions are based on hype.

2. Investors that publicly state buy/hold/sell suggestions (not any specific investor but monitoring multiple)
3. 3 / 6 / 12 month growth trends
4. Morning star risk rating, and fund classes 1-4 for balanced vs risky/industry specific funds
5. The 9 box val/growth and size metric and monitoring where in the chart I am vs where I want to be
6. Monitoring the percentage of investments (cash, foreign, domestic, ect)
7. Adding up the amount of a single stock across multiple funds to prevent overinvesting to one unintentionally

As I was thinking this, I realized there are probably so many other tracking methods that other people might need to be able to effectively use it.

Not sure if everybody is following the podcasts, but for those who listened to this particular episode how is your conviction about factor investing?

My main conclusions:
 1) Publication bias: everyone want interesting things to read. According that, the sample chosen might indicate data mining, which can not be aligned with the out sample.
 2) Premium decay: arbitrages occurred already on the past due exchange of information, but now our capacity to share, analyse and execute everything has over escalated. So, lets say that the reaction to arbitrage is much faster.

After finally saving money and having some free cash to invest (10k) this march(2025), I put it in the market. I started with regular stocks and then went into options. All went well, I gained around 200$, then with options I was making gains of $3000. I got overconfident as usual and then the market tanked in April and I lost all my money. Basically totaling around $20k. From panic sells and what not. Ever since then I’ve been just in a deep state of depression about myself as a person, I blamed myself and I was embarrassed and thought I could do nothing right. Seeing the market reach ATH the moment I exited the market, and keep rising every day checking stocks daily just to see new highs made me feel even worse.

I recently found more inner peace by focusing on stuff that actually matters. Been going to the gym and spending more time outside and with people. 
Financially however things are not looking too bright. I still deal with a complete lack of confidence, embarrassment about money and yet another fear that once I start investing I will just lose it all .. 

how do you overcome this fear ? What do you do? Because right now I’m just lost and am more scared than ever about my financial future.",23,64,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwjw9t/how_to_deal_with_fear_and_embarrassment/,new,Unknown,0.7

I believe NTLA is setting up for a potentially big move. Two major clinical data readouts are expected soon, one for nex-z (ATTR-CM) and another for lonvo-z (HAE). Both use in vivo CRISPR editing, which has huge financial advantages over ex vivo: it’s more scalable, less costly, and can be delivered as a one-time therapy without the complex, well.. ex vivo, steps.

Declining interest rates, high short interest and possibility for cnpv voucher are also something to consider.

I have strong belief what Intellia is doing and how it’s doing those things (CEO is very good imo). First BLA application should be submitted in 2026 and pipeline is only getting more interesting after that in coming next years.

Reddit has really helped me pick winners in the stock market, so thanks to all of you! Because of that, all of my stocks have shown gains. Now I’m looking to simplify my portfolio. I currently hold 12 stocks: RKLB, RYCEY, IREN, HROW, PL, LUNR, XPEV, NBIS, SOFI, LAC, POET, BBAI.

Which of these do you think have the strongest future growth potential and still offer a decent entry point? Also: what do you all think of PNG and RZLV as possible additions?

For context, NASDAQ: MYNZ is pursuing a multi-cancer diagnostics strategy, with CRC commercialization now complemented by a high-need pancreatic target.

What to watch: feasibility readouts that confirm discovery-stage performance, initial clinical design outlines, and any partnering interest given the disease’s poor survival and screening gaps.

24% International (ex-US) Developed Markets 

12% Emerging Markets 

14% U.S. Small Cap Value 

8% International (ex-US) Small Cap Value

And I learned ... that's NOT how they work.  You can't have two different holdings.  You apparently can only connect two different order TYPES for the SAME holding.  Sell it, enter a repurchase order automatically, for example.

I can't see how that's the least bit useful!

SO, THE QUESTION: UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS \*IS\* THAT TYPE OF ORDER USEFUL?  When would I want to automate a limit sell and a buy or the same stock?  Or a limit sell and another limit sell?  Who is the primary user of such an order ... daytraders?

My gains in these stocks here have already increased by 10-40% in the past few months.

Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious. 

Social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to pig-buthering scams and pump-and-dump scams. - do not assume that an offer to ""help"" is legitimate.

1. Good explanation of pig-buthering here - [Pig butchering - how to spot](https://dfpi.ca.gov/news/insights/pig-butchering-how-to-spot-and-report-the-scam/)
2. Legitimate investment advisors do not use WhatApp, Telegram, Discord, etc. to provide tips. In the US - it is against regulation - specifically SEC Rule 17a-4 and FINRA Rule 3110. For example - brokers in the US that use social media for support do not offer investment advice. 
3. It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams. It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else.
4. Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media - bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks.
5. One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.
6. Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake. If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser, be wary.

Depending on where you live -  you can verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser. Most countries have legal requirements for investment advisors and brokers to be registered. 

United States - check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here - [https://brokercheck.finra.org/](https://brokercheck.finra.org/) You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here - [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)

If you believe that you or someone has been the victim of a trading or investing scam. Be aware of the following:

1. Do not send more money. Do not provide additional banking or credit card information. 
2. It is common to be contacted by additional scammers who may pretend to be law enforcement or private services to offer to ""recover"" funds for payment. This is a common follow-up scam. Law enforcement will never ask for money. 
3. If a login account was created. The password used is compromised. Change all passwords that are used. The password will be shared and sold to other scammers.

Here’s how I see it:

* Short term: it’s going to push costs higher. $14B isn’t pocket change, and I wouldn’t be surprised if this weighs on margins in upcoming quarters.
* Long term: this screams commitment to AI. Meta isn’t just playing around with chatbots or ads they’re building infrastructure that powers recommendation systems, future metaverse projects, and whatever comes next in large-scale AI.
* Competitive angle: it positions them to better compete with the giants already dominating cloud + AI Microsoft, Google, Amazon. Instead of renting capacity, Meta is basically locking down the horsepower they’ll need for the next decade.

Personally, I like seeing this move. It reminds me of when Amazon poured billions into AWS back in the day. Painful upfront, but it turned into one of their biggest growth engines.

1nuzdzn,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 00:59:18,Why I keep buying uber shares below 100 everyday,"Here are few reasons Why I am bullish and why I think uber is still cheap below hundred.
I am on my mission to make uber my no 1 position in my portfolio.

1)   $40B+ annual revenue, growing double digits, yet still priced cheaper than many mid-cap techs.

2) Over $1B+ FCF, with potential to compound and I dont think it’s priced in.

3) stakes in Grab and Didi

4) Partners & Key Moves Uber & Lucid: Nuro is supplying the self-driving tech for a robotaxi fleet of Lucid SUVs, to be deployed via Uber’s service. 20,000+ robotaxis over 6 years starting ~2026. 

5) Nuro has years of delivery-bot testing, deployment in limited domains; its robotaxi program via Uber-Lucid is just ramping up.  
So basically what nuro does it builds its own autonomous driving technology so instead of selling cars like tesla it sells the brains basically self driving technology.
So I tell how uber can use it for its advantage as uber.
So basically Lucid makes the cars, Nuro integrates their Autonomous tech into their cars and uber put  it on their platform.
I know it can put pressure on margins but I think uber will find its way to increase their margins somehow trust the management.

I know and understand the definition of book and market value (ie book and market value of equity). What I don't understand is why the market doesn't consider book value (wholly) when making investment choices and why they indirectly mix together accounting with other valuation methods instead.

In your traditional university stock competition, the main valuation you undertake for a stock is the DCF ie cash flow discounting to get enterprise value, then minus debt and add cash/non op assets (roughly) to get Equity value. Now, I compare that to the market price.

  
I have a problem with this because its mixing up accounting principles with market perception of value.

Book equity value is just Assets- Debt, and then  
Therefore, enterprise value is equity value + debt - non-operating assets (roughly)

  
Now, what I don't get is how we can use market cap equity value and then use accounting terms to get to enterprise value, or how we can simply use DCF to get enterprise value, then use accounting principles to get equity value.

  
We are combining methods of how markets wish to value things like enterprise value (DCF) or equity value (market cap), and then mixing accounting principles even tho the accounting view and market perception view are not using the same basis, so how can we mix both LOGICS??????????

It seems like at least every other day, there is a doom and gloom story that the market is going to go down. Sometimes I look up the author and notice that their background is in journalism, and they have no formal education in business, or finance or economics. Sometimes I notice the people writing these articles are just out of college.  
I'm starting to wonder if the media companies require a certain amount of these doom and gloom articles to be put out every week, simply because it draws on fear and fear gets more clicks, which in turn gets more eyeballs on their ads. It would be interesting to look at all the articles that have been put out over the last 20 years or so to see if this is the way it has always been, no matter what is happening in the market. My guess is it has always been this way.  
Chatgpt made what I thought was a good point in saying, ""they put articles like this out, because markets are cyclical , and they know, eventually they will be correct."" If that is true, I find that very disingenuous.  
There have been bull runs that lasted 11 years. From what I looked up, it was 2009 to 2020. I can't say for sure, but my guess is these media companies were putting out doom and gloom articles the entire time.

Still I need to read news on the stock market but I'm growing tired of constantly seeing this stuff. I can ignore the article but I can't ignore the sensationalist leaning headlines.

not telling anyone to buy (do what you want, it’s your money). I just think it’s funny how this is like the one vice industry wall street doesn’t openly mess with even tho it’s probably bigger than half the stuff they pump.

– would you buy into OnlyFans if it ever listed?

I get that you can't time the market so moving funds out of our large cap growth funds with the intention of moving back into them after the crash is probably not a sound plan?

1nufyxd,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 11:17:11,"Honeywell, spin off, next General Electric? Opportunity? Division into 3 new companies: Materials, Automation and Aviation.","In 2021, General Electric decided to dismantle its historic conglomerate by dividing it into three autonomous companies: GE Aerospace, GE Vernova and GE HealthCare.

The overall capitalization of the three companies rose to around 474 billion dollars, compared to 290 billion before the split. In other words, the market recognized over 180 billion in additional value thanks to the separation.

Why does this happen? There are three main reasons. First: conglomerates often suffer from a market ""discount"", because investors struggle to give the right value to very different businesses. By separating them, each company becomes more readable and comparable to direct competitors. Second: capital management improves, because each entity can invest without having to compromise with the needs of other divisions. Third: a dedicated board of directors and management can move with greater clarity and accountability.

Let's talk about Honeywell. Today the company is organized into four major areas: Aerospace, Safety and Productivity Solutions, Building Technologies and Energy and Sustainability. Translated into a post-spinoff scenario, we could imagine three companies: Honeywell Aerospace, Honeywell Automation (which would combine the first two non-aerospace divisions), and Solstice Advanced Materials, focused on specialty chemistry and decarbonization technologies.

The shareholder letter decided to give 1 share of solstice for each share of Honeywell. The split of the other 2 divisions is expected at the end of 2026.

The Aerospace segment is by far the strongest and represents the main source of revenue. Honeywell supplies avionics, engines and auxiliary systems to giants such as Boeing and Airbus, but also to military aircraft and even future eVTOLs such as those from Joby Aviation. In addition to this, a significant portion comes from after-sales services: maintenance, repairs and overhauls which guarantee recurring flows.

Honeywell Automation, on the other hand, would focus on industrial automation, intelligent warehouses and security solutions. Think of scanners, robotics and voice-picking systems in Amazon warehouses, gas detectors and PPE for industrial workers, or energy and fire management systems for complex buildings such as airports and university campuses.

Finally, Solstice Advanced Materials would represent the “greener” and more futuristic side: CO₂ capture, green hydrogen, advanced battery materials and sustainable chemical solutions. A reality in its own right, with a positioning perfectly in line with the ESG priorities of global investors.

For an investor there are three paths. The first is to buy Honeywell shares now and wait for the split, then deciding whether to keep all the companies or sell the less interesting ones. The second is to wait for the spin-off and bet directly on the most promising horse, which in all likelihood will be Aerospace.

A recent research note from a major international bank initiated coverage on one of the L4 players, WeRide, with an optimistic outlook. The report set a $20 target price. The bank’s reasonings:  
  
One, global reach. The company holds autonomous driving permits in a reported seven countries. This globalization focus is cited as a significant first-mover advantage, especially in international markets.  
  
Two, valuation logic. The $20 projection wasn't just a number; it was based on a discounted cash flow model. The analyst's conclusion is that the stock is 'undervalued compared to peers'.  
  
This brings up a crucial question for anyone looking at this space:  
  
Is the public market underestimating the commercialization potential and international scaling of these L4 companies? A 96% implied upside suggests the street is pricing in a much slower, tougher rollout than the analyst consensus.

Oklo announced today that the NRC has accepted for review their Principal Design Criteria (PDC) report under an accelerated timeline. The PDC report usually defines the safety, reliability and performance requirements that will underpin future reactor licensing and design efforts. Because it’s accepted early and ahead of schedule, once approved it can be referenced in future applications- meaning that Oklo won’t have to re-defend those criteria each time, which streamlines licensing and speeds deployment.

They also noted that the NRC accepted the report in just 15 days (versus the typical 30-60 days), and **the NRC expects to issue is draft evaluation by early 2026- about half the usual review time**. Legislation and regulatory modernization efforts are cited as supporting for accelerated licensing pathways.",16,1,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nudkn6/oklos_nrc_principal_design_report_accepted_for/,new,Unknown,0.8

Looking at their valuation metrics they seem very overvalued.

Sure I cannot compare a regional bank to worldwide bank like that, but after all we are interested in the value investing when not speculating and I don't see the value in buying 25% profit margin banks with 13-16 PE ratios. How are those banks safer bets compared to NECB with 6 PE ratio, 43% profit margin (double compared to some big banks), higher dividend (around 2 times bigger, as they just 1 month ago released a special dividend not present on the calculations) and many other metrics being better like PB and return on assets.

Let me explain: I have been trying to buy a few Muni's on Fidelity and while several of the available bonds have an ""Ask"" and a Minimum listed, hardly any had any ""Bids"". Moreover, the couple that had Bids listed next to them had significant spread and when I put a bid that was HIGHER than that was listed, my orders fell through. That means the seller was unwilling to budge and could be sitting on the Munis for a long time. Hence my question about the liquidity of these securities? Or are there better trading platforms where Muni's are traded more ""efficiently"" than Fidelity Brokerage?

Anyone have any light to shed how easy it'll be to get a good price on both buy-side as well as sell-side if I got into these? Appreciate any advice.

I know all about tax benefits, TEY, YTW, Coupons, Call Options, AMT benefits etc etc and have decided I do need to buy Muni's so that's not the issue.

Last traded price = 74.948  
Coupon rate = 3%

Yield to maturity (YTM) = 4.88% *(calculated using ChatGPT)*  
RBA benchmark yields 10 years = 4.297% *(source: RBA)*  
Face value = $100  
  
  
This bond is trading at a **discount** evident by the fact that it is selling below its face value (75<100), and also because the current yield is higher than the coupon rate (when prices go down, it pushes current yield above fixed coupon!).   
The reason it is trading at a discount is because its coupon rate (3%) is less than that of similar government bonds at 4.297%. Investors aren’t willing to pay full price for it. Because of this, demand for this bond has fallen, lowering its price, until its YTM   aligns with similar bonds (RBA benchmark: 4.297% and YTM = 4.88%)   
Additionally, the YTM value is greater the the current yield indicating it is at a discount, and it shows investors will have a capital gain at maturity. *(Fernando 2022)*",1,1,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nu072y/how_correct_is_my_analysis_of_this_bond/,new,Unknown,0.57

I do know that the general argument for growth over dividends is that dividends are immediately taxed and you do not control when that happens, whereas with selling appreciated stock, you have (some) control over the tax implications.

On the other hand, with dividends, I understand that there is a certain advantage to reinvesting dividends and picking up stock at a potentially lower price during lean times.

Majority of my wealth is in US based tech RSU (\~60%) that has been performing above my expectations. Primarily for diversification, I want to bring it down to 30% in the next 6-8 months.

Note: I am intentionally not seeking broad market indices for the next 5-10 years.

|ETF|Ticker|Allocation|Reasoning/Alternative|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Russell 1000 Growth UCITS|**R1GR**|50%|Growth focus, similar to SCHG, but less concentrated than the Nasdaq 100.|

|MSCI World ex US UCITS|**EXUS**|10%|Core global diversification (similar to VXUS).|
|Momentum/Small-Cap ETFs|**SPMO/IDMO/AVDV**|25%|Split equally among these 3 for small-cap, momentum, and value exposure. (No good UCITS alternative found).|

When moving from a fixed amount of equity to cash, the equivalent of DCA (dollar sell averaging??) seems to be to sell a constant number of shares periodically. (There have been other posts on that.)

In the first case, you have the cash and can always buy the shares (assume fractional shares are possible.) If you adjust the cash you spend (e.g., via Value cost averaging) you may sometimes not have the cash available.

In the second case, if you sell a variable number of shares to meet a cash point, you may come to a point where you don't have enough shares to make that. If you sell a fixed proportion of the shares, you can always sell.

Now let's throw in another variable. I have an ETF that I am going to sell and a stock I am going to buy. The ETF shares can either be correlated with the stock, or not.

What is the minimum risk strategy for making the transfer?

1. If the two equities are correlated, do I sell a fixed number of ETF shares or a fixed value of ETF shares? The cash obtained is used to purchase the stock.
2. If the two equities are not correlated, do I sell a fixed number of ETF shares or a fixed value of ETF shares? The cash obtained is used to purchase the stock.

1ntwo3a,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 18:51:32,1 year of investing: here is my outlook,"Hey guys I wanted to make a little list here of all of my wins and losses. My dos and donts of my personal finances.

So let's begin where ive been putting my money. Now im pretty happy with how I did it. I've had a huge sum just rotting (that's how you gotta see cash, as literally rotting) rotting in my bank account.

So step 1: get off your ass and put it in a mutual fund. ""Oh its not as good"" blah blah its better than just having it sit there and you do nothing about it. Procrastinate procrastinate... just do it.

Step 2: learn about ETFs. The more you learn about mutual funds the more you realize theyre ripping you off. So start putting your own money into a self directed investing account.

Step 2.5 (for canadians): Use TSFA or HSFA or RRSP. If you're young and make decent money, use HSFA. If you make very little money use TSFA. If you make a lot of money, use both. Remember there is a limit to how much you can put in and rules about them so go learn.

Step 3: dont start gambling. Basically you (me not you this is what I did) have no idea what youre doing and now youre just guessing what might go up or down. People on tik tok saying Costco is a buy or amazon or Google or whatever. I bought them all. I still have some but here's my rule right now: only hold what you're willing to lose. If you've got 1000 in your account then only holding 10 in Microsoft might seem like a failure since its up 19% so you might be tempted to put 200 in. But take it from me, im still holding onto stocks that ive over invested in and theyre losing. 

Step 4: go slow. You cant beat the market. Just put in money bit by bit. And if you have a big chunk of money, just put it into something safe and buy little by little every week. Set aside a reasonable amount from your paycheck and invest in the same reliable ETFs

Step 5: here is what i invest in:
40% S&P 500, (best option)
10% Gold and/or silver(market stablizer)
10% Uranium (betting on global turbulence)
20% Global markets (diversify)
20% China (risky wealth building) 

So my results after a year

My mutual fund with 60% of my money (in 1.5years) = +16%
My TSFA with 30% = +7.5%
My HSFA with 10% (8months) = +12.5%
S&P 500 = +19% (damn I really thought I did better than that)

First for context, we have been comfortably borrowing to invest for a while, and generating great returns with a healthy mix of growth etf’s + some generally high yield dividend split corps (think bk.to). We currently have approx 40% growth compared to the initial loan size, and are now generating 18.15% aggregate yield. On the side of this, I’ve been toying with a margin account, buying in and out of healthy canadian stocks with low volatility, and selling back a few cents above for small but fun profits. Grew about 1k to 5k in the last 6 weeks doing so, but I digress.

The idea that struck me is, what if I combined the power of 15% + yield machines with the extra buying power of a margin account. And I am not JUST talking about the 3.33x leverage it would give on day one, but the realization that every single distribution that comes in would theoretically further boost our buying power by the same 3.33x.

For the sake of argument, let’s assume a simple 30k/70k scenario in which I invest 30k and obtain 100k in buying power. Let’s also temporarily ignore any stock price change for now. Out of concern for a rapid market downturn and potential margin calls, let’s also stick to never using more than 60% of the total buying power. Meaning I’m only using 60k of the 100k on day 1, keeping a (I think) healthy 40k/40% spread from my max.

This 60k, invested at 15%, would net 9k a year, or a clean 750 per month. Normally, I’d reinvest that 750 month to month, meaning each distribution actually gets rolled into the 15% calculation and the actual result by the end of the year would be slightly higher than 15% (but of course, this would potentially be negated or further amplified by the price variations that will of course happen).

Now the real kicker here is that inside a margin trading account, that 750 is actually also leveraged at 30% and thus creates 2500 in new buying power. Using the same safety formula, let’s only use 60% (1500) and reinvest THAT. Now we’re making 15% of that additional 1500 (225/18.75 per month). 

Anyone can draw up a quick excel and understand how supercharged this makes DRIP/Div reinvesting. I did one, with a bunch of different variables, where you can play with the percentage of the max buying power used (you can even start aggressively at say 80% and then tone it down to 60% over the course or x months etc.), you can play with assumed yield, initial seeding money, you can set it to reserve a portion of the unused buying power for the borrowing costs and eventual tax cost that will inevitably become hard to sustain without tapping directly into the margin, borrowing rate etc. 

All of those variables slightly affect how much, but in all scenarios, you’re greatly speeding up the compounding effect, and one can, depending on risk level, initial seeding cash vs portfolio that is being leveraged, reach the equivalent of 5x the month 1 income after only 48 months. Anyone with sufficient time, ie 5-10 years could rapidly generate silly amounts of passive income (and portfolio size).

Here are my actual numbers as of today, in a very top-heavy, start-aggressive scenario:

**Aggressive Scenario**

Initial cash: 30k

Initial Portfolio leveraged: 210k

This gives me a potential buying power of 590k.



Using 95% of it on day 1 :  560,5k @ 18.15% (my current aggregate yield) = 96 644,21$ or 8 053,68 per month. 



This means that on mo 1, the dividend unlocks an additional 26 845,61 of buying power. Because I want to rapidly reduce my risk level and increase the cushion of used margin, I do the following:



\-First account for borrowing cost and eventual owed tax on those dividends  = 698,87 + 2953,60 = 4 506,66 (the borrowing cost is actually taken off of the remaining equity, and the tax cost I’m just choosing to artificially subtract from the remaining equity).



Of the remaining amount, I then reinvest a gradually decreasing %, so having started at 95, and aiming to reduce to 75 over the course of 48 months, I’m now reinvesting 94.58% of the buying power, = 21 222,01.

At 18.15%, this bumps my annual income to 100 496,01 or 8374,67, or a difference of 320.99/mo. That’s a 3.98% “salary raise” lol. Of course this happens month after month, and because everything is compounded, the rate of increase *also* increases. By the end of mo 12, with the math explained above, I should have gone up to 147 184,01 /yr, a 52.2% increase. By the end of year 4, this amount is up to 505 566,08. You don’t want to know what it looks like after 10 years, because it makes no sense to the human brain lol. (In any case I don’T think one could get there because the size of the loan gets above 5M which seems to be the margin loan limit, at least with my current broker - at any rate, by that point, one might want to start reducing their exposure and just enjoying the proceeds of what’s left, which would put any sane person MORE than very, very comfortable.

And this is where I’m starting to doubt what my eyes and my math is telling me - I’m a little (a lot) incredulous that this could actually work, and again, I’d like to fully stress test this notion because it feels too good to be true.

A few things I’ve thought of so no one wastes time on the basics - but by all means, if I missed something else that should be obvious, do enlighten me.



**A)All of this only works so long as there is drastic market drop/recession/war/pandemic etc.** 

This is where your individual risk tolerance varies, and one could choose to start with a lower borrowing power used %, say 65%, and stick to that. This slows down the math, but doesn’t change the fundamental effect of having dividend distributions leveraged at 3.3x (and then using whatever portion you’re comfortable with) 



**B)All of this only works so long as my yield remains that high, implying that none or very few of my securities crash, reduce, or stop their distribution altogether.**

Again, mileage may vary based on your comfort level with risk, and yes, it requires a lot of watching the market for signs of trouble. There is, of course, not a single thing that guarantees safety from such an event. In our specific case, we hedge against this knowing that we have an unusually high job security, a sizeable chunk of investment that will NOT be mixed up with any of this and that covers the full borrowed amount for at the very least the early, aggressive couple of months.



**C)Ultimately, margin calls, because of the above**

Yes, they happen, yes I understand how they can happen and what it would mean, and again, keeping a comfortable cushion + having a backup source of dry-ish funds to inject if shit hits the fan is key.



**D)Ballooning debt amount and inability to actually withdraw the dividends so long as the loan is not paid off**

In my 48 year scenario above, the loan has indeed reached a terrifying size of 2,785M. Because of how margins work, I’d have to wait until dividends reduce the margin-used portion (at 505k a year it would be over 5 years of not touching the money and letting the dividends pay it off, and I’m not even accounting for borrowing costs and taxation here), so the best way out I can think of is to just sell off the securities, shut down the margin account and cash out the entirety of the portfolio, to then reinvest it at more comfortable rates, whatever those may be. At the same 18.15%, and again, assuming no portfolio growth at all, we’d be looking at 241 361 of gross passive income, without any associated loan anymore.

And that’s it, that’s all I can think of, I might edit the post as I think or read some answers to save everyone time. What am I missing here? Any reason NOT to do this?



TL;DR: If one invests in a margin-trading account, and high yield securities (15% and up), those dividend distributions compound extremely fast since every new cash injection in the account adds 3.33x the amount in buying power. One can go from any modest initial seed money and very rapidly multiply their portfolio size, and passive income if that’s what you’re after. I think my math and my spreadsheet are clean, but I feel like it’s too good to be true, and I’d like someone to help me stress test the theory or point out whichever flaw I may have missed.

1nto9qg,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 13:27:47,Investment advice from a friend... WDYT?,"Imagine a situation. Jonny's portfolio is fully in stocks like PLTR, IONQ, OKLO, QUBT, etc... Jonny found them up on Reddit. He's happy with the portfolio being 5x in just a year, seeing how his 10k became 50k. What a deal! At night he dreams that the next year will bring another 5x and his 50k will turn into 250k. Power of compounding! He wonders if it's a good idea to take a loan and sell his girlfriend's jewels to invest in those ""5x"" stocks. When he's a millionaire, he will shower her with diamonds.

In search of advice, Jonny comes to a friend, Kattie, whom he respects for warning him about using leverage and teaching him the concept of volatility. That saved all his money in the past.

Jonny: Hey K! What do you think about that idea? I'm really afraid I'm missing a great opportunity to get rich. Those companies are sure to be the next Nvidia, Apple, and Google. I want to take a risk and go all in.

Kattie: Dude… why do you think these companies are great investments in the first place? Have you seen the financial results and checked the valuation? The P/E and P/S ratios are so insane that I wouldn't even bother looking deeper.

Jonny: You should see what people on Reddit are saying! This is the ultimate game, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. AI will replace all current jobs, and quantum will replace all modern computers. Just yesterday the CEO of that quantum stock said they're the next Nvidia. I'm already up 5x. It means something!

Kattie: Yeah, it means you're a gambler - and CEOs are really great at pumping hype and making themselves money. Look, successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Take your beloved Apple, Nvidia, or Google and look at their history. In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey. In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with its products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. In 2010 it still wasn't too late to buy Apple stock, right? In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was too late? Ha!

Jonny: I don't get your point.

Kattie: Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products, all because management is big on words, selling a ""we're the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action, in product. With a great business, you don't need a middleman selling you a story; you can witness the impact yourself. A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research; take your time. Even after five years, we'll still offer a great opportunity."" They are not loud, because they have a moat! A scam business sells you a beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist. Do you really think those companies you invested in are the next Nvidia, Google, and Apple? Have they demonstrated excellence multiple times over the previous years? Did they really changing the world? Do you see it yourself?

Jonny: Well, I guess we need to wait and see if they'll really create a product that will change our lives. Now I see why you brought up Google in 2005 - it was already impacting everyone's life, but it wasn't a missed opportunity. It was just the beginning.

Kattie: Exactly! Great companies continue to be great and reinvest their talent into developing more great stuff.

Jonny: What should I do with my portfolio? Sell it? Buy Nvidia and Google?

Kattie: I won't tell what you should do. If I were in this situation, I'd first consider myself very lucky. I made good money on a blind gamble. Thanks, life! Then I'd be smarter with my investments. I'd take my gambling profit and reinvest it into an index fund by dividing it into 24 equal chunks and buying one chunk every month. That would benefit me if the stock market crashes because of all the insane gambling hype happening right now. I'd use those two years to learn financial analysis and how to interpret companies balance sheets. That would give me the tools to invest in the market.

Jonny: But 5x, I really afraid that I might miss the next round.

Kattie: Remember, 99% of start-ups fail, even if at some point their stock price rises 10x in a short period of time. That means you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Short-term gains != long-term success. In a gamble, it's better to take a profit and leave the table. 

Jonny: I guess you're right. I'll ask what folks on Reddit think about this situation.

1ntlfop,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 11:41:49,Micron (MU) has lots of room to grow,"Micron Technology is a global leader in memory and storage solutions, a foundational part of nearly all modern electronics. Over the past six months, Micron’s share price has surged by nearly 70 percent, and its year-to-date gain now stands at over 92 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations.

Behind this rally lies Micron’s growing strategic importance in the AI and data center economy.
Its memory chips are increasingly essential for powering artificial intelligence applications, with top-tier customers like NVIDIA, Apple, Samsung, and Lenovo relying on Micron’s cutting-edge technology.

Top analysts from Citi, TDCowen, and Deutsche Bank remain bullish ahead of upcoming earnings, pointing to tailwinds from the expanding data center market, which is forecasted to grow by 33 percent annually through 2030. In Q4 2025 alone, analysts expect a staggering 109 percent year-over-year revenue increase.

With industry momentum, strong financials, and unmatched exposure to AI demand, Micron is shaping up to be one of the strongest long-term semiconductor bets of 2025.

Despite Micron’s impressive 2025 rally, many investors believe it still trades at a discount to its true value. The key reason is Micron's forward price-to-earnings ratio remains significantly lower than peers. Its 2026 forward P/E of just 9.72x is well below the semiconductor industry average.

This disconnect exists because much of Micron’s value lies in its exposure to high-bandwidth memory, a crucial technology for powering AI workloads. Micron’s HBM product lines are sold out through 2026 and the next-generation HBM4 chips are already generating buzz.

Micron is evolving from a cyclical chipmaker into a long-term growth story. With AI infrastructure booming, its undervaluation won’t last much longer.

Wall Street is focused on Micron ahead of its next earnings release. In recent weeks, Citi,
Mizuho, and Susquehanna all raised their price targets, with Citi and Susquehanna now
targeting $200 and Mizuho not far behind at $182.

Citi also reiterated its Buy rating, citing stronger-than-expected demand for AI-ready memory chips. Micron’s earnings per share expectations have risen accordingly, with investors anticipating continued upside surprises.

Micron already delivered an EPS of $3.03 in Q4 2025, significantly beating estimates, and
analysts expect the trend to continue. Key themes to watch in the upcoming report include AI product demand, margin guidance, and capacity updates for 2026.

The AI revolution is triggering a record wave of infrastructure investment. From Microsoft’s $30 billion supercomputer project in the UK to Nvidia’s backing of OpenAI with up to $100 billion in funding, the scale of global AI investment is massive.

Micron sits at the heart of this growth, supplying high-bandwidth DRAM and NAND memory required to keep AI models running. With OpenAI’s Stargate project planning
multi-gigawatt-scale data centers, Micron’s role as a memory provider is becoming even more critical.

Micron has even reorganized internally to reflect this shift, aligning its product roadmap to the growing demands of the AI and cloud markets.

Micron’s financial foundation is solid. The company continues to ramp up R&D investment, especially in AI-focused memory, while improving profitability. Recent quarters show operating margin expansion, and Micron’s R&D budget now exceeds historical averages, reflecting its strategy to stay ahead in HBM, DRAM, and NAND technology.

This combination of profitability improvements and innovation spending makes Micron uniquely well positioned to capitalize on future AI cycles.

Micron has built a strong track record of earnings performance, consistently delivering beats on EPS and revenue.

In Q4 2025, Micron reported an EPS of $3.03 compared to estimates ranging from $2.53 to
$2.86. Revenue was $11.3 billion, also above expectations. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double beats in fiscal 2025.

Micron has now beaten expectations for eight straight quarters. This consistency reflects both demand strength and operational execution and has been a key driver of investor confidence.

Micron remains attractively valued even after its run-up. Its forward P/E is 13.4x, well below the sector median of 19.2x. Its forward price-to-sales ratio near 3.7x is also lower than that of leading AI peers like Nvidia and AMD.
This valuation gap is notable, especially given Micron’s exposure to the same AI megatrends as its higher-multiple competitors. Even a re-rating to average sector multiples would imply a substantial upside, with some analysts suggesting prices well above $200 per share.
While the bullish case for Micron is strong, risks remain. 

Competition from Samsung and SK
Hynix is intensifying, particularly in high-bandwidth memory. The memory market itself is highly cyclical and could be affected by any slowdown in AI or cloud infrastructure spending.

There has also been regular insider selling and approximately $200 million in quarterly
stock-based compensation. Although much of this is standard practice in tech and not tied to
bearish sentiment, it still contributes to dilution. In addition, any missteps in yield, supply chains, or global trade could pressure margins.
Micron holds approximately $11.9 billion in cash and $14 billion in debt, resulting in low net
leverage. Its investment-grade profile gives it the flexibility to raise capital at favorable terms if needed. This reduces reliance on equity and helps limit shareholder dilution.

This financial strength provides a buffer against the memory industry’s inherent volatility and
supports Micron’s long-term strategy.
Looking further ahead, Micron’s FY2027 forward P/E projection is just 10.5x. This sets up an attractive long-term buying opportunity, particularly as AI spending is expected to grow
throughout the decade.

Micron is well positioned to benefit across multiple AI investment cycles, not just a short-term surge.

From a technical perspective, Micron’s RSI currently signals overbought conditions, suggesting the stock may cool off in the near term. However, its price remains well above the long-term simple moving average, confirming a strong bullish trend.

Crucially, the fundamentals support the technical momentum. Robust demand, earnings strength, and favorable industry trends provide a solid foundation, suggesting that any pullbacks may represent long-term buying opportunities.

Governments worldwide are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. The United States has
supported projects in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Norway, while other nations like the UK, UAE,
and Japan are also building next-gen AI facilities.

As a key supplier of high-performance memory, Micron stands to benefit from this global infrastructure buildout. Its products are necessary components in nearly every advanced AI deployment on the horizon.
Micron insiders, including CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, regularly sell shares through pre-scheduled trading plans. While the lack of insider buying may be seen as a mild negative, it is typical in the tech industry where executives are already highly exposed to company stock.

Micron also issues about $200 million in stock-based compensation each quarter. While this
contributes to modest dilution, it is not excessive compared to other major tech firms and is an accepted tool for attracting and retaining top talent.

Given Micron’s growing earnings and market position, this dilution is manageable and does not materially weaken the bullish case.

Micron offers a rare combination of explosive earnings growth, AI-driven product demand,
attractive valuation, and a strong balance sheet. While competition and market cycles require ongoing attention, the upside potential significantly outweighs the risks.

As Micron continues to execute and deliver results, it remains a strong buy ahead of earnings and into 2026.

Investor sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive. Retail traders view Micron as one of the leading beneficiaries of the AI boom, and institutional investors are showing strong conviction.

Hedge funds have increased their stakes and long-term investors like pension funds are holding steady.

With confidence from both Wall Street and Main Street, Micron is becoming one of the most widely embraced infrastructure plays in the AI space.

The semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation powered by AI and data. Micron
Technology sits at the center of this shift. As covered throughout this report, Micron’s rising
earnings, leadership in next-gen memory, and robust financial position give it a powerful
long-term edge.

The company is positioning itself for the future of technology, from generative AI to cloud
computing and beyond. Even after a substantial run-up in 2025, Micron remains attractively valued with room to grow.

All signs point to Micron Technology being a top semiconductor pick for 2025 and the years
ahead.",0,9,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntlfop/micron_mu_has_lots_of_room_to_grow/,new,Unknown,0.43

I've tried searching for the answer and am not finding it, so I'm hoping someone knows: 

When you invest in an index fund, what happens if one of the company disappears? 
(Eg it goes bankrupt or it closes) 
Especially if it is a higher percentage of the index fund? 

Does it differ if it's a mutual fund vs ETFs? 

Are the companies that compromise the index fund set in stone? 
Do you lose that percentage of your investment, or does it get reallocated into the other companies already in the index fund and the percentages for all get adjusted? 
Does the whole index fund get shut down, and money refunded or lost? 

Or does the manager/s of the index fund, find a different company to sub in for the company that no longer exists? 
Does this still happen if it's a passive fund? 
(Are they already swapping companies in and out if some are performing badly? I haven't been watching the complete makeup of funds I've already invested in to notice if they changed since I bought shares) 

I understand/assume there'd be a huge value loss immediately if this happened eap with large companies, so I'm not asking about the value per se, but what then happens with the fund? 



(I realised a lot of the index funds have the same couple of major companies making up a solid chunk of their allocation. I realise the likelihood of eg Amazon suddenly shutting down is incredibly minimal, and I do realise there are likely legal protections in place to prevent this occurring, but it made me very curious with ""but what if?!!"".

3️⃣ Patience is easier for family offices

The appetite is uneven:

➡️ 71% want exposure to men’s major leagues

➡️ Just 19% interested in women’s leagues

➡️ 31% interested in venues/RE and streaming technology

You likely also know that these magnets are used in advanced aerospace technologies and electric vehicles.

But what you probably didn’t know is that they will play a critical role in the new wave of drone and defence technologies which are due for a massive overhaul.

Neodymium is the leading option but Iron-Nitride is expected to surpass this when production increases in the long term. So although robots will eventually move over to the more sustainable Iron-Nitride magnets, there is still going to be huge near-term demand from advanced military and transport technology.

If we look at expected demand versus supply over the next 10 years, we have a lot to be bullish about. The mineral is up 50% this year, but this is a decade long bet and you are still early for this.

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

1nsa2sl,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 19:57:05,You can't beat the market by buying good companies for the same reason you can’t get rich betting on the best football teams,"The idea that information is “priced in” is a notoriously tricky concept for new investors (I know I struggled with it for a while), and it occurred to me that a sports betting analogy might help.

You can go out and bet on who is going to win tomorrow's NFL games, but for most of those games, there's a lot of information out there that leads people to expect that one team is more likely to win. Take, for example, tomorrow's Bills-Saints game. There's a lot of information suggesting that the Bills are a much better team, and are much more likely than the Saints to win. As a result, if you want to bet that the Bills will win, you're not going to find someone who will take the other side of that bet straight up.

To get someone to take the other side of the bet, you have to concede something: either give them better odds (ie they get a bigger payout if their unlikely bet pays off), or a spread, meaning a number of points that the favored team must win by for the bet to pay out (in this example, the Bills have to win by at least 15 tomorrow, if they win by 7, the people who bet on the Saints get the money). The expectation that the Bills are going to win is priced in, the odds or spread adjust until equal numbers of people are willing to take either side of the bet.

The stock market works the same way. There's a lot of information that leads people to expect that Apple will continue to grow and perform much better than the average company. As a result, to get someone to agree to sell you an Apple share, you have to pay a high price: 35 times Apple's current earnings per share (compared to an average of about 26.6 times for the US stock market as a whole). If everyone expects Apple to do better as a company than the market in general, the price of the stock will rise until there's an equal number of buyers and sellers. The expectation that Apple will have above average earnings in the future is already priced in, just like the expectation that the Bills will beat the Saints.

Everyone agrees the Bills will probably beat the Saints. To bet on it, you need to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. Everyone agrees Apple will probably have better earnings than the average company. To bet on it (ie buying Apple shares instead of a total market index fund), you have to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. You can't get rich betting on teams that everyone knows are good, and you can't beat the market buying companies that everyone knows are good. Available information is priced in.

Edit: I stopped watching football a while back, so the fact that the Bills are -14.5 vs the Saints is wild to me.

Edit2: If you think you have a method for finding mispriced stocks, that’s not necessarily in conflict with my point here. The point is that it’s more complicated than simply buying companies widely regarded as good, in contrast to what new investors often assume. (That said I do tend to be skeptical that retail investors can expect to find a market-beating strategy)

Edit 3: the Bills won 31-19, meaning that they won the game but did not cover the spread, and people who put money on the Saints won.",158,127,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nsa2sl/you_cant_beat_the_market_by_buying_good_companies/,new,Unknown,0.75

IREN has been blowing up and is in overvalued territory.


Penny stocks are shares of small companies that typically trade for less than $5 per share and are not listed on major stock exchanges. HIVE is not a penny stock. It is listed on the NASDAQ.

-----
IREN market cap per EH/S is 229M

MARA market cap per EH/S is 102M

HIVE market cap per EH/S is 43M

----


HIVE is adding HPC for AI like all the other miners too.
Currently mining 9 BTC a day and they will be mining 12 a day by the end of the year.
HIVE has a mining margin of 55% because one of their main mining facility is powered by hydro-electric.

----
As of June 30, HIVE had 24.6M in cash and 47.3M in BTC.
On September 26, they should have added around 770 BTC since June 30.

---

HIVE is aiming for 100m annual revenue in HPC by 2026. They also have their BTC mining operations which will be 12 BTC a day. The market is valuing HIVE at 835m as of Sept. 9, 2025.

RIOT is mining 15.4 BTC a day and is worth 8x HIVE who will be mining 12 BTC a day by the end of the year. HIVE already has HPC revenue and increasing HPC capacity while RIOT is starting to implement HPC.

1nrrne6,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 06:17:01,Is Google still cheap? 10 year expected returns,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better.

However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it.

When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value.  
After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years.

From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500.

Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations.

Anyways here are the results:

FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR  
EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR  
Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR

So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price?  
Probably not.

Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs.

That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding.

Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels.

For me this is a clear hold.",270,140,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nrrne6/is_google_still_cheap_10_year_expected_returns/,new,Unknown,0.88

1nrohh5,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 02:54:04,Study shows wealthy investors react more strongly to financial stress (but recover confidence faster),"India does a national household survey consisting of 275,000+ responses. A research analyzing these responses found that higher income groups become significantly more pessimistic about current economic conditions during financial market stress, compared to lower income households. However, wealthy households show no increased pessimism about future economic prospects.

This likely reflects greater exposure to financial markets among wealthy households, they feel immediate stress from market volatility but have confidence in their long term financial resilience. I found this bit surprising as I thought people with lesser wealth would be more concerned about it being eroded away than the wealthy folks. 

The study also revealed that currency fluctuations and government debt spreads impact household confidence more than stock market volatility in India, which is the opposite pattern from developed economies where banking sector stress dominates.

The issues are things like sequence of return risk, percentage of withdrawals, increasing your holdings in bonds, all sorts of topics that just don't apply to people like us, who plan to live off our dividends in retirement.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the entire retirement ""industry"" is geared towards this, and not towards living off of dividends. My free advisor at Fidelity is definitely not oriented towards dividend investing, either now, or in retirement.

I feel like there's some information that I'm missing that only applies to dividend investing.

I lost 80% of my portfolio due to too many call contracts (on another stock that was performing well). I turned $700CAD to $2600USD like a week ago (yes, I'm a poor). I've never earned that much money investing before, and I knew right then there I should just pull half out to lock in the gains, or wait a bit and go back in at an optimal when it has a reasonable dip. Or maybe look at some other stocks.

But no, instead stock started falling further, activated stop limits, price went down, caused more people to sell, activated more limit stops, etc. The stock had been lingering around 9.50 - 10.50 for almost a week - after that huge drop it went down to $7. What's worse is I had a reasonable number of puts (bought too high) and I wanted to get rid of them. Eventually it broke even and I sold it, thinking it would surge back up at any minute.

I was also buying additional calls because their price was so slow, I was sure that there would be at least a mild rally and I'd be able to get maybe 50 - 60% of my money back.

Eventually today it went up to 8.06, and I only had 2 days before expiring. I didn't want to risk holding onto it much longer only for it to fall more. So I sold it and lost $1200USD.

You know what the best part is? It raised 25% immediately the next day after I sold and I would earned over double if I just waited 12 more hours. It went up to like $9.10, and my breakeven was 9.12

This is about the “Prophet Trading Method,” a true golden tip.

There is a very famous prophet named Baba Vanga, known for an accuracy rate of about 85 percent.

If you read her prophecies carefully, you can see the future direction of humanity.

That is where you begin your reasoning.

Of course, not every prophecy comes true, but the important part is the overall direction they suggest.

You can view prophecy as an indicator of humanity’s general course.

So if you take long positions in sectors that align with that direction, even if you face temporary losses, some stocks will naturally rise over time.

For example, if you study the prophecies closely, you will find hints about breakthroughs in human biotechnology, solar energy, renewable energy, AI, quantum computing, and so on.

On the other hand, investing in directions not mentioned in the prophecies, such as oil or coal, could be considered a foolish choice.

The idea is simple. Take the results inferred from the prophecies, select the sectors that match, buy the ones that are undervalued, wait, and then sell when the time is right.

I personally invested heavily in Lithium Americas for its role in clean energy and waited a long time.

Recently, I was fortunate that Lithium Americas surged, and I made a good profit.

You can also find Baba Vanga’s prophecies on Wikipedia for reference.

If you are not sure, focus on renewable energy, AI, quantum computing, or biotechnology.

1nr5v2u,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 12:25:31,5-6 year glimpse - more than 70% of investments that I sold would have - more than doubled - had I held.,"Hello, I just want to state this for the new guys n' gals.  Part of the learning curve is recognizing the fact that a share price can decrease, without ANY fundamental change in the company. The company can absolutely obliterate all expectations, and the ""share price"" can still drop. 
My point is, I sold many lots early because I was new, and impatient. 
I've learned two things. 1- DCA all day. 2- if you believe in the companies fundamentals and nothing has changed, then do not react to outside influence. Do not sell, continue to DCA all day. 
Off the top of my head, I sold: RIG at 0.64, MP at 18, IONQ at 9, ZDGE at 2.4, WD at 43, INTC at 26, RGTI at 8, NOTE at 2, CARR at 55, GME at 13 (PRIOR TO THE SHORT), NIO at 4, ON at 30, RR at 1.40,  ERIC at 3.3, XOM at 60, GE at 130 (13 pre split), UPST at 19, MU at 50, TTD - i sold at 561, but its been RSd and I dont know today's equivalent. 

 All of those above are higher today, than my sell price. Also, when I sold, at whatever time, with the exception of WD and CARR (they where green, but nothing crazy) they where in the red, for sure. The moral of the story was, nothing changed. I sold due to a reaction of the market, NOT, the company. 
Here's the kicker. I'm still up 300% overall  and 1000%+ percent lots, because I learned my lesson. I identified my error, ( I used to panic )
I swallowed that lesson. Took it in stride, and made the change. I stuck with PLTR ( at its worse, down 90+ percent) , RKLB (worst , down 88+) , PL (down 60%). And have been DCA all day, and don't watch the day-to-day. The companies are execution, nothing has changed fundamentally, and the outcome has been nothing but amazing. The result? Today , I'm in the green 300%+ overall. Why? I identified my errors, and key point. ACCEPTED IT AS TRUE. Make the change. And win. (FYI I'm currently down 20% on LIDR, but, I cannot do my job without LIDAR, so for me, the need is there. Company fundamentals haven't changed, ill continue to DCA)

**How do bonds work?**  
Put as simply as I could:

1. Government/firm issues a bond with a coupon rate (interest rate) similar to the market interest rate.
2. **Primary market:** according to RBA (*2022),* when an investor has purchased the bond **for the first time,** this is called buying in the **primary** **market**. *(This first price of bond depends on interest rate, term of bond, and price of similar bonds).*
3. **In the primary market, the buyer pays the face (nominal) value of the bond, and the yield (aka return) matches the bonds coupon rate.** The buyer will want the coupon rate/yield to be higher than market interest rates.
4. But if later on the bondholder decides to sell the bond before maturity, (due to many factors) it will be sold on the '“**secondary market.”**
5. **In the secondary market -** bond market price fluctuates on top of the face value because of supply and demand. There are many factors affecting bond like competing market interest rates (shown below) and the yield of the bond. Makes sense, right? When market prices exceed the face value of a bond, you are paying at a premium. When market prices are below face value of a bond, you are paying at a discount
6. Bondholders will need to recalculate the yield, as the coupon rate no longer matches the yield (because market prices have changed). This is done using this simple formula: coupon / market price x 100 **The relationship between the market price and bond yield is inverse.** *(EconplusDal, 2017)*",10,9,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqrymi/is_my_explanation_of_how_bonds_work_correct/,new,Unknown,0.86

Right now I’m aiming for about a 70/30 split between individual stocks and an ETF. I’ve already funded the ETF side, but for the stock portion I’m trying to narrow down my picks.

My goal is to grow this portfolio at 15–20% annually (minimum) to outperform the ETF, then roll the gains back into ETFs later. I understand the risks and taxes involved, and I don’t mind some volatility since I’m still learning.

The main stocks I’m considering are:
	•	AMD – strong potential if they land new deals and improve their software side.
	•	UNH – looks undervalued; the investigation doesn’t seem too damaging, and the stock hasn’t fully corrected since the murder news.
	•	SHOP.TO – e-commerce is still growing, and last quarter’s earnings beat gave it a strong rebound.

I’m also keeping an eye on GOOGL and researching NVO.

I suspect a larger market correction is coming eventually, but I still think there’s time to benefit from the current bullish trend.

TL;DR: New investor, already in an ETF, now looking for individual stocks that can realistically return 15–20% yearly over the next few years. Thoughts on my picks (AMD, UNH, SHOP.TO) and any counters/alternatives?

1nqlo50,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 19:14:01,"SPT Sprout Social - No one talks about it, and i dont know why","Here’s everything you need to know about SPT - Sprout Social. If you still believe the company is not undervalued after reading this, I can’t help you.

1. In the era of AI, data plays a crucial role. Sprout Social connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this amount of data.

2. Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance.

3. Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.


Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:

- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.


Risks:
- „But there is an investigation“. That’s for wrongdoing. I think there were 200 cases like this last year. Let’s say they have to pay $25 million - $23 million will be paid by D&O, and Sprout will pay $2 million. Thats nothing.

- „I make more profit than they do“. Value doesn’t necessarily equate to profit. Over the past three years, they’ve acquired three companies. The product has received new features and a significant amount of AI integration. Growth is more crucial than profit, as profit will naturally follow. Sprinklr became profitable too early, resulting in revenue growth of about 6%, but the company is currently struggling. Sprout, on the other hand, has experienced double-digit revenue growth and is poised for even greater success as it shifts towards serving upmarket and larger customers, like Honda and NASCAR. Trust me, profits will follow.

- „High SBC“. Yes, this is true, and I don’t like it either. As far as I know, in 2023, they offered their employees SBC. However, at least SBC didn’t increase last year and instead remained flat. Nevertheless, SBC is high, and I don’t like it either. Without it, they would already be profitable. What’s important to me is that they are operational profitable, even though they are not GAAP-based.

1nqfbgz,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 14:57:19,Why do we insist on CRP when there is none?,"Let me use Turkey as an example.

There’s this idea that investors should require an extra risk premium when they invest outside the US. Sure, we can debate the whole “US exceptionalism” thing, but leaving that aside…

According to CAPM, you shouldn’t get compensated for risks you can diversify away. For instance, most European markets are pretty tightly correlated with the global market. So, no matter how much you diversify, you’re still basically exposed to the same risks.

Turkey, though, is different. Since the 2018 shift to the presidential system, its correlation with the MSCI World Index has been just 0.36, with an R² of 0.13. That’s really low. It basically means Turkey doesn’t move with world markets, so if you diversify, you can actually wash out most of its country-specific risks.

So my question is: why do we still tack on an extra risk premium for Turkey?

And here’s a bonus thought: Turkey’s equity risk premium has been close to zero, or even negative, whether you look from 2000 or from 2018. So investors might want an extra return for the risk, but the market itself doesn’t actually provide it. At the end of the day, your opportunity cost is what the real market gives you, and in Turkey’s case, that “extra risk” doesn’t translate into extra return.

1nqcnct,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 13:15:48,Is Auto-Investing in P2P lending a viable option?,"I’ve been exploring ways to diversify my investment strategy and read about the concept of auto-investing in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending on [https://lendermarket.com/lendermarket-risk-rating/](https://lendermarket.com/lendermarket-risk-rating/) . Essentially, P2P platforms allow you to automatically invest in consumer loans based on predefined criteria such as loan terms, interest rates, and risk ratings.

One of the key attractions of these platforms is the potential for relatively high returns. Many P2P lending platforms offer average annual returns in the range of 15-18%. While these returns can be appealing, they typically come with a higher risk profile compared to traditional investments, which is something to carefully consider.

To manage risk, many P2P lending platforms offer risk rating systems to evaluate loan originators. These ratings consider factors such as financial stability, legal structure, and transparency. By investing in loans with lower-risk originators, you can reduce the likelihood of defaults, though higher returns often come with higher risk.

A notable feature is the buyback guarantee offered by some platforms. If a loan becomes overdue for a certain period, the platform’s originator repurchases the loan, ensuring the principal and accrued interest are returned to the investor. This buyback provision can offer some peace of mind, but it’s essential to remember that there’s still a risk of delays or defaults, especially in cases where loans are extended multiple times.

Another consideration is the lack of liquidity in most P2P lending platforms. Unlike stocks or mutual funds, you can't sell your investments before they mature unless a secondary market is available. This means that your capital could be tied up for a significant period, potentially reducing flexibility in case you need to access funds quickly.

I’m curious if anyone here has experience using auto-investing in P2P lending. What has been your experience in terms of returns, risk management, and overall performance? Any thoughts on balancing risk and return when using such platforms?",0,2,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqcnct/is_autoinvesting_in_p2p_lending_a_viable_option/,new,Unknown,0.23

If such a scenario plays out, the market implications could be huge especially for energy.

Oil & Gas: Russia remains a major supplier globally despite sanctions. A credible peace push could ease fears of supply disruptions and potentially bring more Russian crude/natural gas back into legitimate global channels. On the flip side, if escalation happens before talks, we could see another spike in Brent/WTI.

Europe: European natural gas prices have been extremely sensitive to the war. A genuine move toward peace could stabilize or even depress prices, but if the path is rocky, volatility might remain high. LNG exporters in the U.S. (LNG, CQP) could be impacted if Europe shifts away from emergency buying.

Energy Stocks: Majors like XOM, CVX, Shell, BP might see headwinds if peace reduces the risk premium baked into energy markets. On the other hand, stability could boost refining margins and long-term demand planning.

Broader Commodities: If peace looks real, agricultural and fertilizer markets might calm (Ukraine/Russia being key wheat & potash exporters).

As an individual investor, this seems like a terrible return, especially when safer assets like government bonds sometimes offer even higher yields.



I've heard all the simple answers, but none of them seem to fully hold up. My doubts are:



\- The ""Spread"" Argument: People say banks profit on the spread between the interest they pay on deposits and the interest they earn on the loan. But I understand banks create money when they lend, not just lend out existing deposits. So why create money for a low-return mortgage instead of for something more profitable?



\- The ""Low-Risk"" Argument: The loan is secured by a house, making it low-risk. But there have been times when long-term government bonds were both safer and had a higher yield than mortgages. Yet banks kept issuing mortgages. This can't be the only reason.



\- The ""It's the Law"" Argument: The final answer I get is that banks are legally forbidden from creating money to buy bonds? Okay, but that feels like a circular argument. It doesn't explain why the entire financial and regulatory system is seemingly built to make mortgages the absolute best, most profitable thing a bank can do with its unique power to create credit???

I’m fairly new to managing my own portfolio and I find it interesting. I mostly buy xeqt and dca everyday into my tfsa 

I guess my question is do people ever put a limit to sell their stocks if it drops to x amount of $$? I feel things have been trending up for 4 plus years and a lot of people claiming a bubble will pop in the near future. 

I guess I’m wondering if it’s wise to sell your portfolio if shit starts going sideways , ie keep some of your gains, and buy back in after it’s tanked? Obviously no one has a crystal ball, I’m just not sure this is even a feasible idea. Or do majority just let it ride that manage their own money.

For example, 50yo with earnings below $150,000 will have a Roth max of $8,600 (standard $7,500 + catchup $1,100), but higher earners will have a higher limit, because catchup contributions that were previously pretax get added?

1npncdh,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 16:38:02,Be careful with quantum stocks,"I'm an engineer, and my sphere of competence is technology. I'm a believer in quantum computers. Here's why I think it's a bad idea to invest in quantum stocks.

You see, a successful business is not determined by how advanced the technology is, but by its ability to generate a pile of money. Business, first of all, is a cash generator. And we, as investors, want to own great cash generators. The problem with quantum stocks is that none of them are great businesses (aside from maybe IBM and Google, which aren't really ""quantum stocks"").

Let's put aside the complexity of quantum computing and how difficult it is to scale. Let's assume we've solved all technical issues. Do you know how much it costs to build and maintain a quantum solution? Do you know how much it would cost to develop commercialized mass-manufacturing? To educate the personnel? The answer: a freaking unimaginable amount.
  
There's no company in Taiwan that will print you quantum chips on demand. There aren't millions of quantum engineers and software programmers waiting to be employed. The infrastructure does not exist. Quantum technology won't be scalable for decades - maybe half a century.
  
You can't even compare quantum to the AI revolution. AI is still silicon-based and can reuse existing infrastructure. Quantum technology reimagines our entire approach to computing from scratch. And it costs a hell of a lot of money (tons of debt, none of profit).

None of the companies on the market will dominate the quantum space. They're not businesses - they're research labs (and some are scams). The companies that will eventually build infrastructure, hire engineers, and scale to the market don't exist yet.

Technology doesn't mean business. Research doesn't mean cash. And sadly, even established companies with fully built infrastructure and strong brands can fail as businesses (sorry, Intel, I'm talking about you).

See how absurd it is that current quantum stocks already have billions in market cap, sitting alongside successful businesses? These companies print flashy news releases and talk big about how quantum will change everything. They exploit public ignorance about technology to sell wet dreams stuffed with money bags. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Your money will soon end up in the pockets of insiders and hedge funds.

This is a reality check not just for quantum stocks, but for tech hype in general. Think twice where you put your money. Maybe it's better to take your profit, consider yourself lucky, and buy your girlfriend flowers or a house?

Not investment advice, of course, but I'd rather put a smile on a girl's face than invest in quantum. ;)

P.S.
When in doubt, trust fundamentals, not your biases. Don't fool yourself into thinking you would've picked Nvidia in 2015 if you only had the information available in 2015. Today is the same - you don't know who's going to be the champ in 2035. It will surprise us all.

1npm4f4,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 15:50:49,Is Celestica (CLS) the quiet “picks & shovels” winner of the AI build-out?,"Seven weeks ago Celestica (CLS) hit the $253 price target I’d set. Since then, the stock has kept climbing, and, more importantly, the fundamentals have strengthened. This isn’t just another contract manufacturer anymore; it’s becoming one of the key suppliers enabling the AI infrastructure boom.



The CCS segment grew 28% y/y in Q2 2025. Its HPS revenue surged 82% y/y, lifting margins and returns. These numbers are being driven by the transition from 400G to 800G network switches, the high-speed plumbing that connects massive GPU clusters. Every major hyperscaler is now ramping 800G programs, and Celestica already has design wins for 1.6T switching racks scheduled to start in 2026.



You can add more GPUs to a cluster, but if the links between them are slow, training times don’t improve. Doubling network speed from 400G to 800G (and soon 1.6T) removes that bottleneck. Celestica spotted this shift early and is now one of the go-to suppliers for ultra-fast switches and racks.



The macro backdrop is also reinforcing the thesis. Nvidia and OpenAI just announced a plan to deploy 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA AI systems for OpenAI’s next-generation infrastructure and Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI to make it happen. Oracle has committed a staggering $300 billion to host OpenAI’s future workloads. All of that AI compute has to live somewhere, connected by somebody’s hardware. Celestica sits in the middle of that supply chain, quietly making the high-speed gear that keeps the AI arms race running.



I’ve raised my fair value estimate for Celestica to $320 per share, up from $253. That’s based on higher CCS growth assumptions (35% instead of 27% in 2025) and a slightly lower cost of capital as visibility and margins improve. The upside comes with risks (concentrated customers and potential capex pauses) but the long-term compounding story is intact.",15,8,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npm4f4/is_celestica_cls_the_quiet_picks_shovels_winner/,new,Unknown,0.7

Before, I was investing more unconventionally through real estate, but better late to the Roth retirement account then never.

I came up with a Roth IRA portfolio of: 50% VTI 20% VXUS 15% VGT and 15% QQQM.  

I've gotten some feedback from that post and have a new split of  50% SPMO 20% XMMO 15% VGT and 15% QQQM.  

Now I was looking for feedback on my brokerage account.  Currently it's comprised of individual stocks that I've just bought and been holding.  It's done quite well recently, up 110% since 2022 but I'm well aware that you could have pretty much picked any stock and made money the past few years.

  
So that leads me to this post, I want to add more stability and start reallocating and distributing my funds differently, mainly adding some ETFs to it.  So this is what I came up with to balance and not overlap the Roth.  

35% VTI 20% SMH 20% SCHD 15% ARKK and 10% to explore ie individual picks.

I want to invest in international securities.  I opened an account with Interactive broker.  But it does not let me invest in international stocks in the country I want.
My other option is to open an LLC that can then invest using a diff vehicle.
I am in complete control so I understand the risks.
What is the process for setting up an SDIRA LLC that is an investment company?

I have friends across different age groups, countries, and financial situations. They work in a wide variety of industries and have very different incomes. Since investing is one of my hobbies, I often bring it up in conversations. Some of my friends invest heavily, some just do the classic “VOO and chill,” and the majority have never cared about investing at all.

In the past six months I have noticed a shift. A lot of those friends who never cared before have suddenly started showing interest. They are watching YouTube videos about finance, and some have even paid for courses on things like evaluating companies and looking at P/E ratios etc.

On one hand I think it is great, financial education is important and learning how to manage money in your 20s and 30s is crucial. On the other hand I have noticed a concerning pattern. Many of them seem very impatient, which is normal for beginners ( I even consider myself beginner after 9 years investing), but they also sound greedy. Instead of starting with safer, long-term strategies like index funds, they are diving straight into riskier plays such as Chinese markets, emerging markets, and individual stocks.

To me this feels like a red flag that people is getting greedy and market is overvalued. I cannot help but think this behavior might be a stronger signal than any market metric.

2- how would you diversify? Please note: with regards to physical gold/crypto I’m not there yet so looking for other options

3- I’m 46, and not yet ready for bonds

4- I am more a long term investor, I love the set it and forget it approach 

5- Another option is paying off my apartment or paying off some of it. It’s at 5.4% mortgage / had it for 4 years / $450k only out 10% down / it’s value dropped 15% since I bought it / I don’t like it and don’t intend to stay there long / some people talk about paying off mortgages or making extra payments > I know this is a predicament often discussed but maybe in my situation it could be a no brainer, what do you think?

I thought I had a good feel of the upward slope of the CAPE and how technology past 20 years might suggest a Shiller PE ratio of 40 might not be a sign of disaster in modern day.

Consider if you normalize the Shiller PE ratio to account for increases in productivity and the ""new normal"" for the level of earnings and productivity per unit capital.

If technology and productivity does not change over time, then Shiller PE graph might look flat, but obviously it is anything but flat for past 25 years.

My ""target"" Shiller PE is \~80 for 2026-2028, jumping to 300-1500 by 3032 depending on social and educational evolution being restructured by pressures from AI.

Thoughts on my portfolio? I’m just trying to grow my money. It’s not necessarily for retirement, but I do plan on just keeping it invested to grow for 5+ years probably so that it’s beating inflation and growing to some capacity where I don’t have to necessarily ever feel like I’m strapped for cash 

Investments into the brokerage account started a month ago. 

ETFs:
1) invested $178,765 into VOO between 576 to 606 price per share. 
* Current balance is about $187,730 with around 9k unrealized gain

2)invested $21,571 into QQQM at about $239 per share 
* Current balance is about $22740 with about $650 unrealized gain 

Individual stocks:
1) Invested about $5k in Google at around $190 a share 
* current balance is about $6500 with around $1500 unrealized gain 
2) Invested about $6300 into UNH between $275 and $300 a share
* current balance is about $7600 with about $1300 in gain 
3) invested $1k in Open Door to gamble a bit. I’m down like $300, since I entered last week and it’s been dipping. Shares bought in between 8.40 and 10.40 

Feedback is appreciated. I’m aware that I’m not very well diversified, esp in the international market as I have nothing for that. I also know that the mag 7 is driving up s&p 500, so I’m quite heavy in tech at this time

Should I rebalance, or does it like safe enough? I know past performance does not predict future too, meaning that international market could beat USA in the future and I’m heavy in U.S large cap right now. I guess I am in a way chasing performance, but I’m not sure if many people actually would criticize my selection or see it as fine. 

I’m looking to grow as aggressively as possible for the future without basically just gambling.

Growth is slowing, job gains are slowing, and unemployment is creeping up. Overall, the economy isn't collapsing, but the party is undoubtedly winding down.



Inflation remains a concern. While below the nightmare scenario of 2022, it hasn't yet returned to the Fed's ""dream"" of a 2% target. Core inflation (sticky inflation) remains lingering. Think of it as a guest at a party that refuses to leave.



Interest rates: a little high, a little low. Powell called current rates ""modestly constrained."" In other words: they're not stifling the economy, but they're certainly hindering its rapid growth. The Fed has already cut rates slightly, but he made it clear that future rate cuts are not inevitable. The data will tell.



The risks are two-way. Cut rates too quickly? The inflation monster could reawaken. Keep rates too tight for too long? The job market will suffer. Powell essentially said, ""We're winging it, but we're doing it in a very professional way.""



Stocks are expensive. He actually said the market looks ""quite richly valued."" The Fed Chairman politely told us, “Yes, you paid a high price for those stocks.",324,140,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1noqbel/powell_spoke_today_heres_the_vibe_check/,new,Unknown,0.87

Key sentences: 

* ""Our vision is simple: we want to create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week.""
* ""... it will require innovation at every level of the stack, from chips to power to building to robotics.""
* ""We are particularly excited to build a lot of this in the US; right now, other countries are building things like chips fabs and new energy production much faster than we are, and we want to help turn that tide.""
* ""Over the next couple of months, we’ll be talking about some of our plans and the partners we are working with to make this a reality.""

Any guesses on who they'll partner with mainly? I'm not super into the end-to-end AI infra space but here's what our good friend ChatGPT says are the main areas:

* **Energy generation & supply:** To scale to gigawatt-per-week growth, you need lots of cheap, reliable, low-carbon or zero-carbon power. Also, grid/interconnection infrastructure must handle large loads.
* **Chips / accelerators / custom hardware:** GPUs, TPUs, ASICs, other accelerators for training & inference.
* **Data center / facility design:** Physical buildings, racks, layout, power distribution, mechanical infrastructure (cooling, ventilation), modularity, robotics for construction etc.
* **Cooling / thermal management & power delivery:**  GPUs and accelerators produce lots of heat; cooling strategies (air, liquid, immersion) become critical.
* **Networking & storage / I/O / data movement:** Training large models involves moving large volumes of data between storage, compute, between datacenters, etc. Inference also has latency requirements, so networking bandwidth, latency, storage speed matter.
* **Supply chain and manufacturing:** Everything needs to be manufactured at scale. Also packaging, testing, transport.
* **Software, orchestration, tools:** Software stack to manage hardware: scheduling of training/inference, utilization, monitoring, fault tolerance, optimizing for power, usage, etc. Also tools for model evaluation & selection, efficiency, etc.
* **Regulation, environment, sustainability:** Ensuring that scaling doesn’t blow up carbon emissions, water usage; environmental permitting; policy around energy usage; ensuring power grid stability; social/environmental impact of building huge facilities.

I have just noticed that there is a new ETF IE000FJJZA01 (since Dec 2024) that tracks S&P 500 Developed Quality FCF Aristocrats.  
Comparing the quality metrics, SP goes for Free Cash Flow metrics (FCF margin = FCF / Revenue; FCF ROIC) and MSCI to standard metrics (ROE and Debt to Equity).

Cash Flow seems more a transparent metric and less manipulated with accruals and so on by the companies when comparing to ROE and others  
Do you have the same perspective?

I am actually building a factor portfolio and I am looking to add one of this in order to reduce a bit the volatility.

Thank you.

As the title says, I will be transitioning to Fidelity soon based on the advisor fees that I am currently paying. The wife and I set this account nearly 30 yrs ago at a time when we didn't know anything and the ability to trade and manage your money was a lot more cumbersome.  Over that time our two ROTHS have grown and are now at $500k (total)) which puts our yearly management fees at just under 5K.  I am kind of embarrassed that I let this go for so long but now I want to transition out of managed accounts and into something where we do all of the managing.

The funds within each of our current ROTH's have a decent mixture of bonds, REIT's and other assets but I feel that it could be better and now that I will be going to Fidelity, it opens up access to many more funds.  I'm looking for advise as to what those funds should be

Currently, each ROTH account contains - FEPIX, LLDYX, MXFIX, COST, MSFT, QQQ, SLV, IVE, IJH, ICF, IJR and VEU

Some more background might help as well -

The wife and I have 3 more years of work.. We have 75K in a HYSA and all our monthly expense, once we stop working at 60, will be covered by my military pension and disability rating. Our military health care covers us until we hit Medicare age. We also have (2) 401ks @ \~ 600k total so the ROTH money will remain largely untouched for at least the next 10-15 yrs.

Knowing all that, how do think I should set up the new ROTHs?

1) The Nvidia-OpenAI deal is massive, with a commitment of up to $100 billion. It feels like Nvidia is locking in its biggest customer and ensuring its dominance.

2) The Nvidia-Intel partnership, with a $5 billion stock investment, seems like a smart way to de-risk Nvidia's supply chain and give Intel a direct line into the AI space.

3) I've also heard that Oracle is becoming a central player in the AI cloud, securing key contracts and positioning itself for massive growth.

I wanted to highlight a trade I called out both in this weekends update and yesterdays daily update. (For proof image 2, or my post history)

It is the 3rd of the 3 setups I trade, I've done some previous updates highlighting the other 2 over the past month.

This setup is a breakout strategy on the failure of an established trend.  On the break of the trend structure I will enter heavy on a retest and generally an impulse leg should bring us to the target zone of the over-riding trend.

For reference the Purple 15m bear structure was established and unchanged on my chart from middle of last week.  

The Blue 1H bull structure was established weeks ago and has remain unchanged as well.

The setup played out perfectly, with a clean test, break, and retest of the breakout line (circled in the 1st image) and a strong impulse toward the target area (the dotted blue line).

This is how good TA works, I am not necessarily predicting something is going to happen.  As I stated in yesterdays update I was actually short going into the day.  

I am just identifying inflection points in the market ahead of time, and depending how the market reacts to those areas plotting a trade from there. 

Wth extended targets and stops outside of structure that if they were to hit I would be sure of a directional change.

I'm up over 10k in profits more than doubling my account in under a month during this forward test. 

I hope some of you who have been following from the beginning were able to capitalize on this trade as well.  I appreciate all of you.

*Oklo Inc today holds a groundbreaking ceremony at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for its first Aurora powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”*

*“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.*

*The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.*

*“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”*",16,1,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1no05ld/oklo_breaks_ground_on_first_aurora_powerhouse/,new,Unknown,0.71

1nnytkk,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 17:14:33,My predictions for 2035 -what will be a goldmine and what will be a spectacular collapse,"
**1. Corporate jobs, white-collar, office jobs, working for corporations** -this has already been revealed as a scam career nobody thinks seriously about since how companies use AI to layoff people.

I would not invest my career path into being a cog in the corporate machine.
Layoffs, optimizing quarterly earnings by offshoring, and AI are taking over.
In my opinion, these jobs are too risky. The ultimate goal of corporations is to cut costs on employees, pay them as little as possible while keeping them from quitting, and maintain a constant large supply of workers (including migrants) to create endless competition and an employer’s market.

It’s very risky to invest in corporate jobs. I would stay away, even if today tech, finance, etc. offer good salarie because your job existence depends on whether the corporation wants you or not. It’s a pointless career in the era of AI.

**2. Independent career paths**

Jobs and professions where your clients are ordinary people and you control how much you work and who you work for. Dentists, nurses, hairdressers, car mechanics, builders, plumbers.
Services you provide directly to ordinary people, work independent from boss and managers.

**3. Small business owners**
Again, independent jobs outside the traditional 9-5 corporate slavery, without bullshit like time tracking and annual performance reviews. Local pizzerias, restaurants, beauty salons, electronic shops, food shops, etc.

**4. Marketing and influencing**

Having a large following userbase, being public and visible on the internet, building a community, being a YouTuber,  with 100k+ subscribers.
Why? Because it allows you to leverage that audience to create businesses you already have a ready user base.

**5. Innovations against capitalism and corporate culture**

Since the job market is terrible and will be even worse in the future, all innovation around fighting consumerism, anti-capitalism, and small alternatives (to McDonald’s, Amazon, Facebook etc.) will grow. 20 years ago, these companies were liked by people because they were innovative and helped improve people’s lives. Now they hoard all the profits for themselves and harm society, the economy, and the job market. People hate large companies now, and they will be seeking friendly, ethical, anticapitalistic alternatives who share profits with ordinary people and make their life better.

In the future, angry people who lost their jobs due to AI will also move away from large corporations. Just like iPhones will become outdated the way BlackBerry phones did, alternatives to Amazon and other corporate giants will emerge.

The next trend is anticonsumerism. All innovations that provide alternatives to AI, big corporations, and consumerism will grow. This is especially visible in Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Being poor and frugal will be cool. A few years ago, people admired influencers and celebrities now they hate them for flaunting luxury lives they’ll never have.

Previously, wearing Louis Vitton and rolex was considered impressive, but now people laugh at that. Wearing Temu clothes is seen as cooler because everyone knows buying overpriced products is for losers. Among the younger generation, wearing Louis vitton or riding a porsche isn’t a flex anymore, it’s cringe. People despise these status symbols, seeing them as losers tricked into buying overpriced corporate bullshit that’s worth $1 instead of the $10 000 they paid.

**6. Loneliness epidemic**

This is a huge problem. Right now people replace their social contact with tiktok and social media, but even though they use it, they still crave real human connections. Anything, businesses or innovations that solves this problem and unites the younger generation could be the next airbnb level innovation.

**7. Squeezing money from services for the middle class and rich**

All the work and services where the rich are consumers will provide a lot of money. Cleaning their houses, quality food for the wealthy, nannies, spas, luxury brands, etc. Prices for services targeting the rich will rise.
Just like corporations raise prices for products while cutting labor costs, people providing direct services for the rich (cleaning ladies, nannies, food delivery, spas, etc.) will raise their rates, squeezing money from the rich. People hate the rich and will overvalue these services as a way to get money back. 

**8. Investing in stocks**

I believe the UBI of our time will be investing in stocks guaranteed profit in the era of AI. On one hand, we can hate AI as corporate robbery used to lay off people. But on the other hand, we can ride the wave and invest in their stocks.

The recession isn’t coming in the next 10 years, corporations have everything in place now. The poor will struggle, but the capital market doesn’t care. Capital markets exist to make money.

Investing, especially in AI companies, is a safe bet. Ordinary people may dislike AI, but billionaires are already pouring money into it and will continue to. Large cap stocks at this point are like a safe UBI with 20-30% YoY gains.

What do the rich do if they want more money? They invest in stocks. Years ago, the stock market saw recessions, 20% drops, Black Mondays, banking crises, etc. Now the stock market doesn’t even react to that. The rich pour their money into stocks because they’re too lazy to create something new with real value they just click, buy stocks, and do nothing while their capital multiplies.

1nnyjfw,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 17:03:27,Should We Trust AI With Our Investments Researches?,"There has always been debate on how much trust to place in AI when it comes to investing. The benefits are easy to notice. It can process massive amounts of data faster than any individual, scanning price action, news, sentiment, and even onchain flows in real time. It also takes emotions out of the equation, offering signals that are more structured and less tied to fear or greed. For investors who want speed and efficiency, it feels like having an assistant that never sleeps.  
  
But there are also clear drawbacks. It is built on patterns and past data, which means it cannot fully predict sudden shocks, unexpected changes in sentiment, or events that can move markets overnight. It can also make traders overconfident if they begin to trust it too much, forgetting that markets are still shaped by human behavior and unpredictability. Another concern is that if too many people use similar tools, trades might become crowded, reducing the edge that individuals are looking for.  
  
These pros and cons make me think more carefully about how it could fit into my own investing approach. because I usually rely on bitget for my digital investments, but with the platform now upgraded into a Universal Exchange that combines crypto, futures, and even tokenized stocks in one place, the idea of using it there is becoming more tempting. I see how something like GetAgent could reduce the amount of manual research I do by pulling real-time prices, tracking smart money movements, and reading sentiment in one screen instead of many.  
  
The real question for me is whether I should actually bring it into my routine or just keep it as an optional tool. Should it remain a supportive layer in the background, or is it worth giving it a higher level of trust in making decisions? I have not yet committed to it because I want to weigh these points carefully. It feels like the future of investing is moving in this direction, but I am still curious to hear whether others think it should guide decisions directly or simply provide data that we interpret on our own.",0,6,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnyjfw/should_we_trust_ai_with_our_investments_researches/,new,Unknown,0.22

1nnti8f,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 13:53:39,Stocks is giving me a better return than crypto.,"I might receive a lot of hate for this but I sold all my crypto weeks ago, was holding cash collecting pennies on stable coins but now full ported into heavy tech, now up 13% in 3 mo, while BTC is slowly dropping and/or dead movement.  

I ditched ETFs a few days ago (SPY/QQQ) because those are safe options and I'm investing in tech with good growth and company financials / fundamentals. 

I've been in crypto since early 2017s and imo BTC isn't an investment anymore, rather a pump n dump. Big corp. has control over it now, the more they have invested the more they have control over it. I knew this in the back of my mind when government slowly took control. The more BTC rises the more money needs to pour into it to get a return. 

Alt coins give you a nice return but I don't want to put in the search effort that can potentially be a dead coin months later. 

Two of my friends in my discord also convinced me to pull from BTC, and there reasoning was, you need a lot of capital to make a % of what the returns were. 

Was also watching a podcast with tucker carlson and his guest said government and big corp want full control of BTC to pump and dump and use buyers liquidly to pay off national debt, take it with a gain of salt.

I looked up how much BTC does on year average says 20%ish - which is very good, except exchanges take a huge cut of your profits. Even had coinbase+ still was losing on it. Switched to kraken instead. During the bull run I made a decent amount then sold for profits but lowkey if I had NVDA/PLTR I would profit off growth/fundamentals instead of an ""agreement"". 

Lastly, my mentor himself who got me introduced to options even said he doesn't touch/hold BTC and hes been invested in the stock market for 10+yrs and made 10M+. 

Just my opinion would love peoples thoughts.

Just alone in the past 2 Years, AI has advanced and grown a significant amount and is only proving that it will continue to do so. I have my eye on two stocks that have been doing very well, TSMc and NVDA. Both of these companies work together and have a good relationship, and they both heavily rely on each other. TSMc manufactures and produces these H20 chips which are directly correlated to powering AI. As time goes on AI will become more powerful and will be of use a lot more which will create more demand.

After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

1nnfyrl,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 03:24:22,Why EnSilica is Worth Possibly 13x its Current Price (Updated),"Okay, so you are probably thinking… yeah right, here’s that degenerate Double Bubbler banging on about that penny stock again. Well take a brief moment and read the following to see why my opinion is not so outlandish. You may one day thank me for it.

EnSilica develops custom semiconductor chips called ASICs. Essentially dedicated silicon expertly designed to a particular task such as providing encryption for Internet of Things devices, or efficiently moving data across satellite networks as will hopefully soon be the case with their custom ASIC for AST Space Mobile.

Recently MDA Space acquired a relatively low profile Israeli firm Satixfy for $280m in an all cash offer. Satixfy being a competitor to EnSilica in the ASIC marketplace and high growth satellite communications industry, with 2024 revenue of $20.6m. So that acquisition price is over 13x last year’s revenue!

Compare that with EnSilica’s forecast FY25 revenue (to be confirmed in results anticipated next month) of approximately $25m to $27m as well as a forecast FY26 revenue of between $44m and $47m with ‘80% of FY 2026 revenue already covered by existing customer contracts’ according to EnSilica’s trading update on the London Stock Exchange in April. *Please note I have used the current FX rate to convert figures that were originally quoted by EnSilica in GBP.*

Consider also that another competitor of EnSilica’s is Filtronic who have significant contracts with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Given the importance of Filtronic’s ASICs to SpaceX it has formed a strategic alliance with the firm and acquired 10,949,079 warrants - 5% of the current share capital of Filtronic - which would give SpaceX the opportunity to acquire a notable stake in the firm. Why would it want that? Well in my opinion to ensure they could have a say in the future direction of the firm as well as perhaps giving them the opportunity to create a defensive position to fend off hostile takeovers of Filtronic.

On the subject of Filtronic it is worth considering their forward price-to-sales ratio compared to EnSilica’s. EnSilica trades at a forward PS of just over 1.12 (against the low end of their current FY26 forecast) which compares to Filtronic‘s forward PS of 5.3 according to Simply Wall St data. If EnSilica achieves a similar forward PS as it approaches it’s anticipated medium term sales projection of c.£100 per year (hopefully together with a healthy profit margin) then you could see a market capitalisation of £500m+. That’s 13.44 times the current share price.

Who do I think are likely contenders to acquire EnSilica? Well Qualcomm could be a prime candidate in my opinion. Or another large and diversified semiconductor manufacturer that appreciates and can take advantage of the breadth of EnSilica’s IP, not just the sat comm work but including the post quantum encryption chip, optical networking design IP and automotive radar IP which is being developed in tandem with Radareye following funding from a consortium including Transport for London, IAG and Admiral.

Another possibility is AST Space Mobile, who EnSilica signed a contract with for a high value satellite ASIC in 2021 and which I understand will be a core component within AST’s BlueBird Block 2 satellite constellation scheduled for launch in the coming year or so. I consider AST a possibility as I wouldn’t be surprised that over time they broaden their offering to more fully compete with SpaceX’s Starlink (e.g. higher bandwidth satellite comms with guaranteed quality of service via terminal devices for static and mobile situations). EnSilica has a suite of IP for satellite terminals (a market which is worth billions of dollars) and owning that IP could help AST better compete with Starlink in that scenario.

I can also see U.S. and European companies such as Boeing, Airbus or Thales taking interest, especially given plans for the European Union’s forthcoming IRIS2 constellation. EnSilica’s IP and talent would seemingly be of great benefit to various industry titans in the satellite communications race that is heating up rapidly.

While I would like to see EnSilica grow to become a future British tech champion, I could understand the management accepting an offer of approximately 13x FY26 revenue. With a notable holding myself, I would not complain either.

While EnSilica’s share price fell last week, I still have immense conviction in this promising company and my recent discussion with Chairman Mark Hodgkins has only given me additional confidence in its future long term potential.

Yes, the share price may be turbulent in the times ahead however I may accumulate further should weakness persist (as I did last week) or following what I feel is an unlikely near term event, a rights issue, as is rumoured on ADVFN for example. 

EnSilica is a company I intend to hold for the years ahead given their apparent trajectory as well as potential for being acquired at a significant multiple to its current value.

Is This the End of the Road for AMD or a New Era of Competition?,"seismic event just happened in the semiconductor world, and it has major implications for investors. NVIDIA and Intel announced a historic collaboration, with NVIDIA investing $5 billion in Intel and forming a joint venture to co-develop new chips for AI and personal computing.

This partnership is a big deal because it brings together two of the biggest players in the industry, which immediately sent shockwaves through the market. While Intel's stock saw a massive jump of up to 30%, competitors like AMD saw their shares drop by over 9% in initial trading.

Analysts are now debating the long-term impact on the competitive landscape.

1) For AMD: The concern is that the new partnership could create a powerful, integrated offering that directly challenges AMD's products in both the data center and consumer markets. This move may put pressure on AMD to accelerate its own product launches and strategies.

2) For the Alliance: The deal could be seen as a way for Intel to get a much-needed lifeline and a direct path into the AI space, while NVIDIA gains a massive partner to expand its ecosystem.

What's your take? Is this the beginning of the end for AMD, or will this simply force them to innovate faster and make the market even more competitive?",147,105,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnf3pl/nvidia_and_intel_just_partnered_is_this_the_end/,new,Unknown,0.83

1nnd9am,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 00:40:08,Why Gold Is About to Take a S**t-Ton of Power From the US Dollar,"Source: Interesting video from Bravos Research https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_D5geZvfzs&t=1s&ab_channel=BravosResearch

In summary, they think the value of the US dollar is being repriced against gold, a trend that has happened twice before in history (1970-1980 and 1999-2011), when the dollar lost 90% of its purchasing power against gold. A rise in gold prices often coincides with systemic economic issues and a rising US unemployment rate because a weakening economy prompts the government to lower interest rates and increase spending, which makes the US dollar and Treasury bonds less attractive to investors.

While gold prices are currently rising, the unemployment rate is still low. This is attributed to three reasons:

1/Global Geopolitical Uncertainty: Governments and central banks are diversifying into gold as a safe-haven asset.

2/Devaluing Government Policies: The US government is running a large budget deficit, and the Federal Reserve has been cutting interest rates, which are policies that typically devalue the currency and lead investors to gold.

3/Anticipation of Future Recession: Gold's rise may be in anticipation of a future recession, as consumer confidence is low despite the low unemployment rate.

TLDR: Although stocks may continue to rise in the short term, gold is likely to continue outperforming them.

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley’s are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley’s. When economic conditions are rough, there’s not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn’t be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been heavily declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is “motorcycles are dangerous”. Anyone who rides motorcycles, knows someone who has been injured or killed on a bike. It is not very uncommon in the community.

6. The overall state of the market makes me nervous. Everything’s great until it isn’t and I want to have a hedge against a potential downturn in the market. I think this company would be more heavily affected than anything else I could choose from.

1nmnmh3,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 05:34:11,"Late cycle consumer spending shift = downside CMG, SG, etc?","
TL;DR: bearish Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen. Looking for suggestions on similar situations. The devaluation of fast casuals, lululemon feels like a symptom of shifting culture and consumer behaviour. Inflation, portion size shrinking, declining economic activity, consumer fatigue, non existent brand loyalty, and limited scope to rebrand, reinvent, optimize. Late-cycle cultural and consumer-spending shift, where former aspirational brands (fast casual, athleisure, boutique fitness, “accessible luxury”) have gone from status signifiers to punchlines.

Six years ago I visited a Lululemon store for the first time having been familiar with the brand for many years. I knew the brand as a high quality expensive semi boutique level product associated with Soul Cycle, Equinox etc. The store gave a different impression. Some of the clothes were wrinkled and badly presented, customer service was non existent, and they seemed to have no inventory. I assumed it was a one off bad example. But over the following six years I saw the same symptoms again and again and again. Meanwhile, other clues appeared: bigger and bigger sales discounts; diversification into non-sports products with no cohesive direction; a noticeable drop in quality of some garments (I’ve received a few Lululemon gifts down the years). Competitors with cheaper, equally good quality gear eating their market share. 


When I read about $LULU’s demise, I thought “oh course!” (hindsight’s easy, huh?) and began thinking who’s next? While already down bad this year, I can’t help shake the feeling Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen have much more downside risk. The traction gained by the “slop bowl” meme to describe their offerings feels like the Chipotle’s Mr Big dying on a Peloton bike moment. An increasing number of comedians joke about slop bowls and the term “slop bowl” has spiked to four times its previous highs on Google search trends this week. It sounds trivial, but this pervasive content influences our tastes, prompts us to take a look in the mirror at stuff we do on autopilot. I think small rallies / dead cat bounce short covering strength just offer nice entry position opportunities to get short.

With inflation rising sharply, portion sizes shrinking, declining quality of ingredients being masked with higher and higher salt content, these brands need to reinvent in other directions. Trouble is, I don’t know where they can turn. I don’t trust they do either. 

The 2010-19 period brought Netflix, Spotify, fast casual lunch spots with “healthy options” and “fresh ingredients”, it brought Equinox and Soul Cycle and F45 and Amex Platinum lounges to create the illusion for aspirational young professionals that they’ve made it to the top. That illusion is being dismantled. Costs are spiralling, fees are rising, and all these brands and business models feel tired and dare I say a bit embarrassing? These brands were once exciting and pleasing. Aspirational. Now, they feel tired and clichéd. Their complacency isn’t deserving of our money and I think they are heavily exposed to a new wave of disruptors over the coming years.

The 2010-19 era saw consumer spending shift away from luxury goods, cars, Electronics and refocus on travel, food, lifestyle. With more Americans owning passports than ever before and travelling to Europe in record numbers, it might sound silly to claim we’re at a turning point from experience-centric consumer spending, but I truly think we’ve reached saturation point in this cultural cycle. I suspect we’re seeing the beginning of the end of this cycle with no clear path to what the next looks like. 

One thing’s for sure: queueing up every day to buy $20 cardboard bowl of rice, cheese, soggy chicken, greens, some kind of flavored salty liquid labelled as dressing is an undignified experience we will come to laugh at in years to come.",19,6,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nmnmh3/late_cycle_consumer_spending_shift_downside_cmg/,new,Unknown,0.76

It started off with cannabis stocks (I'm Canadian) years ago and I got burnt. Not a huge deal tbh since it was something I considered a bitmof a gamble.

I'm trying to find guidance on when to sell and when to simply hold for the long term. 

It's not that I need the money right now but it might be nice to pay down some debt or maybe put it onto my mortgage. Or hell even to sell and put the money into a new sub $20 stock and try to grow it from there.

1nm5v7l,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 14:34:54,"Have 100k euro to invest, what are the best options","Hello,

Im from europe, Slovakia, 30 yo. Have my own flat payed off and have one inherited that I rent for 500 euro and nett of it is around 300. Don't have any debts nor family to take care of. Net worth of all my assets is around 250k.

In past 5 years I managed to save around 100k eur, just worked and saved everything at 2% account. Plan was to buy some investment property or help my brother and his girl to get lower mortgage for their house, but they split up.

Due to political situation, demographic situation and failing economy I don't see buying property here as good investment. Don't want to deal with tenants in this economy either cause lot of people won't be able to pay rent and I will take the losses. 

So I'm looking for other options. Learned about stocks at school and investing in them individually seems risky, so I started to look into ETFs. 

Investing here in my location to ETF here is pretty new topic, asked AI but I would like to know about real life experiences with ETF and investing, what is your best portfolio, is it safe to invest like 80k, is it possible to get like 500 euro mothly from dividend?

1nm58pv,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 14:09:53,Opening Discussion About RDDT,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.

1nm2vdm,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 12:36:20,$LENZ Therapeutics - VIZZ Eye drop relieves farsightedness for 10 hours and gives most users 20/20 vision.,"
Hello true to my name I have some DD on a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read??” Let’s bring those big Mr scientist science terms to reality.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. For those of you like me with an IQ below your waist size. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you. With Boomers refusing to retire they need this product like a fish needs water.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient that doesn’t effect the muscles around the eye but rather the dilation of the pupil. It creates a pinhole effect that increases vision up close. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•	Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•	Target population of the US is 128 million people - They are currently scaling up for distribution and plan to start full access in October. Few samples and marketing begins now.

	•	A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year.

	•	The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600 depending on many factors.

⸻

Company Financial Health: Strong

	•	Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•	Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•	This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•	They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•	They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•	It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•	The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•	Cramer likes the stock

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter. My position is small and speculative at about 1% my total net worth. However I plan to add more if good news keeps coming out about their scaling and distribution phase.",3,26,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nm2vdm/lenz_therapeutics_vizz_eye_drop_relieves/,new,Unknown,0.56

The original plan was to max out the Roths then the pre-tax, BUT we might have an opportunity to “retire” early (in our early 50s) and live abroad. The income gap to cover will be lower and so will health insurance and healthcare. We can do our traveling in our 50s and then move back in 7-10 years if we wish to. 

We will have our Roth contributions and probably rent from a property we will have managed while we are gone. However, we will also need 35k or so liquid in savings, and I’m trying to figure out the best taxable brokerage to use. Since this money won’t go to traditional retirement investments, where can we start parking savings and still get some growth? We bank and have a small investment account with So-Fi. Roths are with Edward Jones (I know, but my husband has the bigger one and likes talking to a guy and our 529 for our kid in college is there and mine could be moved). Vanguard? Another?

1nlzp7t,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 10:30:57,Where to invest at the end of Oct,"My wife and I normally save 4K per month after all retirement, HSA, bills, etc. That fluctuates a little on months we take a big trip but fairly consistent. We have a 6 month emergency fund. 

Every month we draw down our account to the 6 month emergency fund with 50% to VTI, 25% to an individual portfolio I manage with individual stocks of varying risk, and 25% straight to a second HYSA (separate from our emergency fund). The second HYSA is because my wife has 0 risk tolerance and I accept that knowing we have cash on the sidelines if there is a huge opportunity from a downturn. 

October is a 3 check month for both of us and my wife changed jobs so we will have a much larger surplus this month with her sign on bonus, PTO payout, and 2 additional pay checks. 

Should we stick to the 50-25-25 plan we have with just more money, take an opportunity to start a new investment (VOO or similar), stash more in cash, YOLO on 0dte calls/puts? What would you do based on the current market conditions?

Let’s say one of your holdings is doing really well, like skyrocketing. But of course, you know it can just as easily drop at the same rate. 

How do you decide if/when to sell and move it into something more stable? Or, do you just hold and say your prayers? 

The stock I am currently pondering is OKLO. It went up 28% yesterday, and all indications are that it will continue to grow now that there is all this attention on nuclear energy. But- nuclear stocks tend to be volatile depending on politics and current events. Not to mention the reality that as soon as anything goes wrong with nuclear production (meltdown, etc) it will likely tank the stock prices and be down a long time. 

Very curious what folks think. TIA. 

Link to OKLO’s site https://oklo.com/overview/default.aspx

*Edit: I’m returning a few days later to say thanks for the advice! I learned a lot. I ended up selling enough of my OKLO shares to cover my original investment and left the rest, am just gonna let it go for now and do what it will do. The intense fluctuations were stressful but now that it’s all just shares generated from profit I am less concerned. 

I’ve been looking into nuclear stocks that feel less risky and speculative. I went with Constellation Energy (CEG) and NuScale (SMR). Both are further along than OKLO, CEG is already building plants for Microsoft and SMR is a startup like OKLO but has federal regulatory approval.

1nltg3d,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 05:12:25,Plot Twist : Good ESG Companies Might Actually Trade Backwards in Emerging Markets,"You know how everyone says futures markets are supposed to lead spot prices because they're more efficient? Well, turns out that might be completely backwards for companies with strong ESG scores in India.

Think about it, if you're tracking a company with stellar environmental and governance practices, you'd expect the usual pattern where futures traders get the info first and spot prices follow. But a recent study analyzing 22 Indian companies across 11 sectors using daily price data shows the opposite happening. For high-ESG companies, the regular stock market is actually leading the futures market.

My take: This could mean one of two things, either the spot market has become incredibly efficient at pricing in ESG information, or there's something fundamentally different about how investors value sustainability in emerging markets compared to the West.

The really wild part? This pattern completely flips for companies with poor ESG scores, where futures do lead spot prices as expected. It's like there are two different pricing universes operating simultaneously.

This has practical implications if you're building ESG-focused portfolios in emerging markets, the traditional technical analysis playbook might not work the way you think.

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I’m doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I’ve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I’ve never had much of a strategy, I’ve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I’ve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in “core” growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in “moonshots” like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. 

The issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max. 

I struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I’m up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there.

I think gold is the best investment in the current market climate with everything going on.

Gold's rise has been astounding recently. It has performed 33% YTD, 45% over the last year, and 80% over last 2 years.

Bull cases for Gold:

1. Rate cuts means more money will be pumped into economy. More money supply will only increase gold's value and devalue the dollar.

3. Inflation remains elevated and current tariffs will only add fuel to inflation.
4. Uncertainty with governments globally are spending money on military.

3. Gold up already massively over the last 2 years. Investors may dump their profits and buy into other assets.


Maybe I am to much of a doomer millennial, but I don't see this stock market holding up in the medium term. Rate cuts will boost the stock market and we may have a minor pull back or two, but by the end of next year the bubble will deflate. Almost every stock metric is screaming overvalued.

And if the bubble does pop, where will people put their money? Are treasuries still the safe haven? Or has US Debt gotten too out of hand? Will more people pile into gold? Silver? Crypto?

India's regulators just opened up REITs to retail investors and they're getting included in equity indices. This feels like one of those regulatory changes that could actually move the needle.

Context: REITs were mostly institutional before, now everyday investors can get in easier. Plus the equity index inclusion should improve liquidity significantly.

I'm curious about the timing - this comes right as we're seeing institutional money flow into affordable housing elsewhere (Brookfield's $10B+ manufactured housing deal in the U.S., for example).

Anyone with experience in emerging market REITs? Regulatory changes like this usually precede bigger investment waves, but India's property market has its own unique dynamics.

I started investing 5 years ago. Im from hungary, so we have very good yield on government bonds. 6,5% for 3 years bond (this is for citizens only, not institutions).

I have a stock portfolio, which is performing very well. But I dont have an intention to increase it at the time.

Instead with my spare money I started flat flipping, my return on a flip is between 10 and 30% but realistically it will decrease to 10-12% net a year (market is changing).

My question is: what is your oppinion, it is worth to continue flipping for a 10-12% net percentage, or should I put in on bonds, the yield difference is only 3,5-5,5%. Which I know is significant, but bond require no work, flat flipping requires 20 hours a month.

So what so you think, the 3,5-5,5% is worth the 20 hours and headaches, or should I put this time to focus on other things, and just sit on bonds?

What is a good return above bond yield?

To calculate how much retirement savings we will need to maintain a certain budget without our nest-egg ever going down requires some data.  I used to think my investments get a certain rate of return, then they will generate enough income to match or exceed my spending, but then I started thinking about inflation, and how that will impact the AMOUNT of money I need to maintain the lifestyle.

Is it accurate to say that if you subtract inflation from the rate of return, that the difference is sufficient for that calculation?

Example (with fake numbers).   If I wanted to retire with $50k of investment income, and didn't want to spend down my nest egg, I would only need to know two things.  How much savings and at what differential between returns and inflation?   If I wanted $50k, if I had a million dollars and returns were averaging 7%, inflation was averaging 3%, the differential would be 4%, I'd be getting $40k of income.   ($10k short of my goal, so I really need $1.25M)

As I type this, I think it's still wrong, because $40k today is worth more than $40k in 10 years, and it has more spending power now than it will then.

Brazil apparently also has something similar called Pix 

Apparently there's more similar systems popping up in many countries, both utilizing Central banks and operating via QR codes, independent of the american visa/mastercard payment networks, not only are they simple to use, they are purely digital and convenient. 

The most important evidence of their value though is the fact that Murica has attacked both systems, calling[ Qris a 'trade barrier](https://windonesia.com/article/us-cites-qris-as-trade-barrier-but-us-payment-model-unfit-for-indonesia)' or[ Pix 'unfair to Murican companies'](https://paymentexpert.com/2025/07/22/us-investigation-brazil-pix-payment-system/)

Back in the late 90s/early 2000s, there was active following on Investor Village on the Rambus thread with handles like Watzman, CroakerFrog, ScruffyNYC, and many others.  After Intel designated RDRAM the sole memory for their new Pentium chip, Rambus skyrocketed and briefly traded above 100 in early 2000.  However, RDRAM was poorly received by both consumers and memory makers due to cost and some technical issues and resistance from the memory makers.

After a series of legal setbacks, failing to win infringement claims, losing an anti-trust lawsuit, and having to face a politically motivated FTC investigation, the stock price crashed and traded in the single digits.

I came across this article about a couple who chose to invest in stocks instead of buying a house and they were able to retire within 3 years! Maybe they got lucky, maybe the story is BS. But, should we all start allocating a bigger share of our incomes toward companies that are likely to be on the winning end of the AI transformation? Most people's investing plan is based on the goal of retirement in their late 50s/early 60s, but what if most of us won't have jobs years before that? We may have a lot fewer years than we though, and we may have to start acting like it.

Co-ownership in 'home' seems like crazy concept to me (imagine the number of problems you would face in decision making!). 

But given this is a vacation/luxury home - whoever is buying these homes as fractional oowners must be doing it as an investment. Checked on trustpilot - overall owner rating seems high (but less number of reviews <200 - i guess that's because there can be only so many home owners/pacaso customers ?) .

Now to their Reg A class D shares offering -->

I saw their news (paid of course) on sites like morningbrew and likes. And since I searched for it afterwards, i now get to see lots of their ads too. 

 Some things I don't like is their PR. They will be like Pacaso secured Nasdaq symbol PCSO but they are not doing IPO. so why worry about getting a name ?? seems gimmicky. or maybe there is a reason.

This is their first public offering. So I am not sure if anyone heard or has invested in it (apparently 11K people so far have invested 55M + - no way to verify this claim apart from their website.

Their VC investors include top names - like Softbank vision fund. But i am wondering why these investor are not investing now and why is Pacaso instead doing a reg A instead and raising from people instead.

I am looking at making things as easy as possible for my wife when I'm no longer around and while she currently doesn't take an very active role in our retirement planning that will change here in a couple years.

1nk32sg,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 04:51:28,$APLD DD AI Datacenters huge run from $3 --> $20 since April,"I think $APLD deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story.

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.

I noted she is getting interest from the following investment:

Co-oprative Group Limited 
11% final repayment subordinated notes due 2025
ticker symbol 42TE 
Isin GB00BFXW0630

I’ve googled them and I still just don’t understand how they work. It says they are due in December 2025 - what does that mean? 

She holds over 5500 of these notes and their current value is over £100. Surely that can’t mean they’re worth over £500k? I think I’m missing something key here. The interest she was receiving was about £600 twice a year.

1nk15dh,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 02:45:23,How to protect my mom from inflation?,"My mom is in her mid 60’s and is sitting on about $100k+\- usd from her inheritance. It’s all cashiers checks that she refuses to cash and deposit into the bank. Might be something left over from a divorce way back or bankruptcy. Either way, I’ve tried telling her that she’s lost nearly 10% of her cashes spending value this year alone. Invest in SOMETHING at least. She says, “ I need a place to live but I can’t afford one”. Boy will she be shocked when prices rise again and stay elevated… With the rate cuts current and planned, I can foresee even more sticky inflation in our futures. That being said, I’m a casual investor with only my limited experience these past 10yrs. 
My questions are as follows:

1- How do I effectively simplify and explain these current events and how they affect her and her savings. Now and in the future.

2-What is the general consensus on a relatively safe investment with liquidity in approx 2-5yrs? Normally in this situation with her age I wouldn’t recommend stocks. Too volatile even the “safer” bets to guarantee her investments safety in a time frame she could access it. Shoot I’m young enough I’d be riding this thing out but she’s not. Then there’s silver and gold. Both at almost all time highs. That was my first knee jerk reaction but again. Would hate to have her invest in a top of which I couldn’t help her with. Still, with inflationary pressures I think for it’s mobility and stability I think she should stack gold. If she’s not going to invest it through normal channels. 

My family historically hasn’t been the best with money/investments. Best bet would to find a good financial advisor but see previous sentence…I just worry that her fear of making a move will hurt her more than actually doing something to combat this.

1njurb9,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 21:03:54,Why Palantir (PLTR) Is a Strong Buy in 2025,"Palantir Technologies has been a standout performer in 2025, soaring significantly year-to-date on the strength of impressive earnings, AI-driven momentum, and major government contracts. Despite concerns about its high valuation, is this a tech bubble or a justified winner? The evidence suggests Palantir is capitalizing on AI with disciplined growth, profitability, and a strategic edge few competitors can match. Here's why Palantir is a strong buy for 2025, addressing bearish concerns and showing why they fall short.

Palantir's financials demonstrate a rare blend of rapid growth and profitability. First-quarter revenue showed strong year-over-year growth, followed by a record-breaking second quarter, particularly in the U.S. with commercial revenue surging. Full-year revenue for 2024 was robust, but 2025 is accelerating further. Unlike many high-growth tech firms, Palantir is profitable under standard accounting, with a notable net income increase in the second quarter and high operating margins. Cash flow is equally impressive, with significant free cash flow growth, far outpacing peers who often burn cash. Management has raised full-year revenue guidance, signaling confidence in sustained momentum. This combination of growth and financial discipline sets Palantir apart.

The core of Palantir's success lies in its AI Platform, which allows clients to run advanced AI models securely on private data, delivering insights for industries like supply chains, finance, healthcare, and defense. Strategic partnerships amplify this advantage. A groundbreaking collaboration with Microsoft integrates Azure's AI capabilities with Palantir's platform in classified defense environments, described by CTO Shyam Sankar as a major leap forward. Palantir also works with OpenAI and partners on responsible AI with Anthropic and Google. These partnerships are driving real contracts, such as deals with Fannie Mae for fraud detection, NATO for defense intelligence, and various U.S. federal agencies. Palantir's platforms, including Foundry for enterprises, Gotham for government, and Apollo for deployment, are proven and reliable. CEO Alex Karp is using AI internally to boost efficiency, aiming to multiply revenue with a lean workforce, showcasing a commitment to operational excellence.

Palantir's contract portfolio is a cornerstone of its strength, blending long-term government deals with a rapidly growing commercial business. A major U.S. Army agreement signed in mid-2025 consolidates numerous contracts into a multi-billion-dollar framework, praised by Army leadership as a step toward modernization. Additional defense and federal contracts, including classified programs, solidify Palantir's government presence. Meanwhile, U.S. commercial revenue is growing explosively, with a robust pipeline of high-value deals across finance, pharma, and energy sectors, where data security is critical. This balance of government and commercial contracts ensures a steady stream of recurring revenue.

Leadership is a key driver of Palantir's success. Alex Karp, with his bold vision of an AI-driven ""efficient revolution,"" is targeting massive revenue growth with a smaller team. The second quarter was described as phenomenal, with the company exceeding expectations and raising guidance. Founders and executives hold significant stakes, aligning with shareholders, and Karp's control allows a focus on long-term innovation over short-term market pressures. With a strong cash position and minimal debt, Palantir can fund research and weather market fluctuations, maintaining lean operations with high margins.

Compared to peers, Palantir shines. Against data and AI firms like Snowflake, Palantir combines faster growth with profitability, while Snowflake remains unprofitable. [C3.ai](http://C3.ai) shows promise but lacks Palantir's scale and margins. Traditional defense contractors dominate hardware, but Palantir's software and AI focus carves out a unique niche. Big Tech offers cloud services, but Palantir's specialized AI workflows, often in partnership with firms like Microsoft, fill a distinct gap. Karp argues that advanced AI models need Palantir to function effectively in real-world applications.

Skeptics raise valid points. Palantir's valuation, with high price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios, suggests risk if execution falters. However, its rapid growth, consistent outperformance, and major contracts support a premium. Government revenue concentration is a concern, but bipartisan support for AI and defense, along with multi-year deals, reduces risk, while commercial growth diversifies the business. International revenue has been flat, but Palantir's focus on the U.S. market is driving results, with global defense wins adding upside. AI hype could fade, but Palantir's practical applications, from logistics to fraud detection, and strong industry partnerships ensure staying power. Insider selling and Karp's unconventional style raise eyebrows, but significant founder ownership and a long-term focus outweigh these concerns.

Palantir is a leader in AI-driven analytics for critical applications, with strong growth, high margins, and a fortified position in government and enterprise markets. Karp's vision of efficiency is delivering, with quarterly revenue surpassing key milestones. Despite its rally, the market may underestimate Palantir's long-term contracts and commercial expansion. In a world where data is king, Palantir is a leading force. This is a strong buy for 2025.

WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - U.S. credit rating agency Moody's Ratings flagged several potential risks in Oracle Corp's [(ORCL.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ORCL.N) $300 billion of recently signed artificial intelligence contracts, but stopped short of taking ratings action against the software giant.

One of the main risks flagged by Moody's involved the ""counterparty risk"" of Oracle relying on large commitments from a small number of AI companies to fund its business model.""

Counterparty risk is always a key consideration in any type of project financing, particularly where there is a high reliance on revenue from a single counterparty,"" Moody's analysts wrote on Wednesday.""And in our view, Oracle’s data center build is effectively one of, if not the world’s largest, project financing,"" they added.

The analysts further noted the company will see its debt increase faster than its EBITDA, which will contribute to a forecast high leverage of 4x before Oracle's EBITDA begins to outpace its debt.""It is likely that free cash flow will also be negative for an extended period before reaching breakeven,"" the analysts wrote.

Oracle had a Moody's issuer rating of Baa2, which is at the lower end of investment-grade credit ratings.

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (LXRX) is currently trading around **$1.08**, and from what I’m seeing, it looks like they might finally be getting their act together. Here’s a quick breakdown:

* **Pipeline & Partnerships:** Their experimental obesity drug (LX9851) has a **partnership with Novo Nordisk** worth up to **$1 billion in milestone payments** with $75M upfront. That’s a huge vote of confidence from a major pharma player.
* **Products Ready for Market:** They still have sotagliflozin (INPEFA®) for heart failure and other metabolic disease candidates. They’ve trimmed commercial operations to focus on **R&D and licensing**, which could mean they’re gearing up to push their promising products to market more efficiently.
* **Price Action:** At $1.08, the stock seems **relatively stable**, suggesting accumulation. For a biotech that’s had its ups and downs, this could be a **setup for a breakout** if upcoming approvals or partnerships play out.
* **Upside Potential:** Analysts have a 12-month price target of **$3.23 on average**, with a range as high as $6.00. If even some of their pipeline works out, that’s a **lot of upside** from the current price.
* **Risks:** Of course, **biotech is always high risk**. Clinical trial outcomes, FDA approvals, or delays could still negatively impact the stock. But with the Novo Nordisk deal and streamlined operations, they seem to have **more runway and credibility** than before.

Fed governor Stephen Miran preferred to cut rates by a half a percentage point and disagreed with the quarter percentage cut.

The Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point with a landslide 11-to-1 vote, setting the target range between 4% and 4.25%.  The 1 vote dissented from Miran, favoring a larger 50-basis-point cut instead.

The **decision of a 25 BP cut** was based mainly on the following:

* **Labor market concerns** with recent job gains have slowed significantly, and the unemployment rate has edged up.
* **Economic slowdown** with indicators suggests economic activity grew at a more moderate pace in the first half of the year.
* **Acknowledged inflation** remains somewhat elevated, but the Fed judged that the rising downside risks to employment warranted a rate cut. 

Officials signaled the possibility of **two more rate cuts** this year.

The company’s great, the quarter was record-breaking, but the risk/reward isn’t as compelling. What do you think? Anyone looked at ODC before?","I wanted to share something unusual for me. I tend to hold winners for a long time, but I just closed a position in ODC after a 57% gain in five months (bought at \~$43, sold at $68).

Back in April I did a deep dive on ODC and called it a “quiet compounder” hiding in plain sight ([here](https://www.beatingthetide.com/p/george-atuan-the-dirt-on-a-quiet-compounder-hiding?utm_source=publication-search)). This is the company behind Cat’s Pride litter and a whole bunch of industrial clays. It owns its own clay mines and makes everything from lightweight cat litter to filtration clays used in renewable diesel. 

My thesis then was simple: vertical integration + shift into higher-margin products = rising profitability, but the market hadn’t caught on. 

Earnings had tripled in a few years and the stock was still at single-digit P/E and EV/EBITDA. 

I valued it at $64.

Fast-forward to today. ODC's last earnings were one of the strongest quarters in its 85-year history: Q3 FY2025 revenue $115.5M (+8% y/y), net income $11.6M (+50%), EPS +51%. 

The B2B segment (agricultural carriers + renewable diesel filtration) delivered record sales and margins over 30%. Even with some hiccups in retail cat litter, the overall business is firing on all cylinders.

**B2B Products Group**: Sales +18% to $42.7M, op income +26% to $13.4M (\~31% margin). Ag products hit an all-time high (+43%) as customers worked through last year’s inventories. Fluid purification clays +13% y/y. Even though US renewable diesel production was down 12% early in 2025, ODC’s sales into that sector were up, they’re winning share at new plants. Amlan animal health stayed flat at $5.8M but management is tweaking distribution.

**Retail & Wholesale**: $72.8M sales (+3% y/y) but excluding the Ultra Pet acquisition organic sales were down \~4%. Clay litter fell 6% due to a lost private-label account and some retailer bankruptcies (think regional pet stores closing). Competitors got aggressive on promos. The bright spot is lightweight litter and crystal litter: Cat’s Pride Fresh & Light and the new Cat’s Pride-branded crystals are growing faster than the category. Ultra Pet added \~$4.8M in Q3 sales and ODC has increased the number of retail “doors” for its crystal litter significantly.

Financially, ODC is conservative: cash $36.5M, net debt essentially zero. They’re doubling capex to $32M/year to modernize plants and meet demand. Dividend up 16% (22nd consecutive annual raise). Management thinks in decades, not quarters. The CEO literally said they plan 40 years ahead for raw material reserves.

Industry trends still support them: cat litter demand projected to grow \~5% annually through 2030 with premium subcategories like lightweight and crystals growing faster; renewable diesel capacity in the US keeps expanding and every gallon needs filtration clay; agriculture inputs stable to positive as farm supply inventories normalize.

So why sell? Valuation. 

The “steal” at $43 has been recognized. Multiples moved from <8x earnings to \~13x, EV/EBITDA from <8x to \~11x, P/FCF from 18x to 25x. My updated fair value is $74, so there’s still some upside (\~8%), but the asymmetric risk/reward I look for is gone. I’d rather redeploy the capital into the next underpriced idea than sit on a position where the margin of safety has shrunk.

I’m still a fan of the company and it stays on my watchlist. If Mr. Market throws a tantrum and ODC dips again, I’ll be ready. But for now, discipline > emotion.

Curious what the sub thinks: do you trim or exit when a small-cap rerates quickly? Anyone else follow ODC or other under-the-radar compounders like this?

1njdniq,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 09:48:00,Bubble worries have sparked my interest in a particular bond ETF,"I do not believe in timing the market, but when there are major economic trends brewing, I do try to position myself to take advantage of them, which is why I'm plowing a big chunk of my portfolio into TLT right now.

TLT is an ETF for 20+ year bonds. It has a decent yield, but more importantly, it is very sensitive to interest rate changes. The moves can be pretty dramatic. It's down about 50% since the days of ZIRP. You don't usually think about capital gains when investing in bonds, but TLT is uniquely positioned for gains if the Fed continues to reduce rates.

My thesis for this investment is that we are either stuck in stagflation or we are on the verge of a recession. If we're in stagflation, the yield from TLT will outperform the S&P 500. If we're in a recession, the fed will likely continue to lower interest rates, and TLT will deliver capital gains on top of a yield.

The obvious risk is that we are actually entering a period of sticky inflation and the job market recovers, in which case the Fed will raise interest rates. But this seems like the least likely scenario. Tariffs are expected to create transitory inflation and everywhere you turn there is weak jobs data.

I’ve been following ACHR for almost a year, but I haven’t added more shares recently because the stock seems a bit volatile despite all the developments.

I’ve done a lot of DD on them and I like their tech and long term vision, but some circumstances have changed over the past few months that make me cautious.

They’re making moves into the defense and military space, with partnerships like Anduril, trademarks like Monarch, Giraffa, and Mothra & property acquisitions near defense partners. They’re also set for upcoming events like the Dubai AirShow and potential operations in Abu Dhabi. These moves could create serious upside if executed well

https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/archer-aviation-inc-achr-a-bull-case-theory-4-1606309/

The main issues are that they’ve missed earnings ($0.36 loss vs expected $0.24), and insiders have been selling significant shares recently. That always raises a red flag, even if it’s not a dealbreaker.

The stock’s trajectory is still promising, but progress has been slower than some expected. Their tech is solid, and the military angle could be a game-changer, but execution risk is real and timelines aren’t guaranteed.

Updated: IonQ reported a net loss of $177.5 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $36.5 million.

With all the acquisitions and compensation to more leadership teams, losses are expected to increase to $ 250 million per quarter.

To acquire Oxford Ionic, IONQ paid $1.065 billion in IONQ common stock and $10 million in cash. So, basically, the stockholders have already been diluted.

1niqq2t,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 15:10:53,Rate my collapse portfolio,"I have a feeling my portfolio is going to make a lot of people mad, but am curious for feedback.

I’ve historically (35 years in 401k) been a pretty modest but aggressive investor, only tweaking my mix every 2-3 years.  At the end of 2024 I moved most of my balance into a self-directed PCRA and into safer investments (mostly international bonds and international index funds).  I shifted a bit more into stocks and precious metals in April and am up about 12% overall YTD.

I’m also a big believer in climate change and in the science behind [The Limits to Growth](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2023-08-14/which-future/), and all the recent science indicates we’re now experiencing climate change at an exponential rate, which will continue to accelerate.  I think that in the next 5-10 years it will be impossible for people to deny, although some will choose to think of it as biblical end times.  Add in all the predictions of a big economic downturn, I’m ready to lock in on a longer term strategy.  

I’m not savvy enough to know if it’s going to be a recession, depression, stagflation or hyperinflation scenario, but it seems like the Permanent Portfolio strategy has consistently outperformed other portfolios in these types of conditions:

* 25% bonds
* 25% stocks
* 25% cash
* 25% gold

Given my long term outlook for societal collapse by \~2040 (give or take 5 years), and the limitations associated with an employer sponsored account, here are the modifications I’ve made:

**25% bonds (+ bond proxies)**

* 10% in ISGH
* 10% in XLU
* 5% in FPI 

I’m betting on utilities to do well with the change to regs around exporting natural gas, and increasing scarcity in general.  I’d like to be more heavily into farmland, but not super comfortable with any of the REIT’s right now to commit more.

**25% stocks**

* 11% in VYMI & IEUR index funds
* 11% in “collapse” stocks
* 3% in my unicorn stock, ASTS

Collapse stocks include companies in agriscience, fertilizer, firefighting chemicals, air conditioner manufacturers, and some Trump admin-inspired stocks like COIN (holding) and PLTR (just unloaded).  I would love to diversify more in this category, open to suggestions.

**25% cash / 25% gold**

* 10% in a 4% CD, which would cover 8-10 mos of expenses
* 15% in physical gold and silver, the remainder of liquid assets
* 25% in gold and precious metals ETF’s

I will purchase more physical gold/silver and reallocate the funds in ETF’s as able.  My goal is to maintain purchasing power as things continue to unravel.  

Anyone thinking along the same lines?  For those who think my outlook is crazy, how do you think this mix will perform?

1nih5qo,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 09:14:19,Defying the news: why do prices sometimes move in the opposite direction of the data?,"Sometimes, a much anticipated new release comes out, and the prices go the exact opposite way than you’d expect. 

Today, US Core Retail Sales for August came in at +0.7% MoM - much better than the expected. Logically, stronger consumer spending signals a robust economy, which should boost the USD and in turn push EUR/USD lower.

But this didn’t happen, at least at the time of writing. EUR/USD is still pushing higher, at 1.18100 and testing multi-year highs. 

Why does this happen?

Here are a few key reasons:

- Buy the rumour, sell the news: Markets often price in expectations before the data hits. Traders anticipated solid retail numbers amid ongoing economic optimism, so the ""good"" news was already baked in. Once confirmed, profit-taking kicks in, reversing the trend.

- Overriding Factors: This one is vital to understand: even strong data can get overshadowed by bigger fundamental stories. Right now, the USD is under pressure from expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, and this dilutes the USD appeal.

- Technicals and Sentiment: Charts matter. EUR/USD has been in a bullish channel, with support at 1.1760 holding firm. Also, broader risk-on sentiment can trump a single US bit of good news.

- Not All Beats Are Equal: If the data ""beat"" isn't massive, it might not shift the narrative as we may expect. A 0.3% surprise here wasn't enough to derail the dovish Fed story or the general USD down sentiment. 

This is the market's way of reminding us: it's not just about the data released – it's about context and the bigger picture. 

The only remedy: an open mind ready for any outcome, and sound risk management.

But I have a contrarian view. Their recent promo 25for25 on the surface may seem like a short term money grabber. But it might be a key to long term sustainability/growth. Those of you not familiar with this promo, just take a look at r/jetblue among other flyer forums and you will be surprised how many people are doing it. The gist of the promo is that you fly to 25 destinations by the end of the year and you get x amount of their mileage points and a status with them for next 25 years. Directly, B6 may lose some money on these flyers (the points one earns roughly offset the amount one spends to acquire them). But imagine this. A person who is sitting on these points, and has a status with the airline, is going to do anything in his/her power to fly with them... for next 25 years. Not just them, their companions who may or may not have the status will likely fly with them too. So, I think it may be the thing that helps JetBlue survive. Third and fourth quarter earnings will give us some data to prove/disprove this theory. Thoughts?

On one side, there's great excitement for AI that drives company values up. It resembles a gold rush, as everyone believes they've discovered the next big thing. At the same time, bond yields are rising, which typically makes investors more careful and can cause them to withdraw money from the stock market. This creates a strange mix of optimism and caution.

This situation raises the classic question: is this a true tech revolution or just a bubble waiting to burst? I find that the real challenge of holding these stocks is the wild fluctuations. One day you’re significantly up, and the next you’re down just as much. It's not suitable for the faint of heart.

To handle this kind of volatility, perhaps the strategy isn't to chase the latest trend but to think long-term and diversify. It might be better to find companies that genuinely use AI to address problems, rather than simply riding the hype.

1ni8qzs,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 01:15:10,"Considering adding some tilt, wanted to hear more feedback","Firstly, here is my current equity portfolio:

* [**VTI**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/vti/) (70%)
* [**VXUS**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/vxus/) (30%)

I've considered adding **value**, specifically small-cap value, and **momentum** tilt to my portfolio. Here is my plan:

* **US vs. Non-US** = 60:40
* **Market cap weight (MCW) vs. Factors** = 75:25
* **Value vs. Momentum** = 60:40

I've also been studying most ETFs' methodology, and I like Avantis and Alpha Architect. Here are what I plan to add:

* [**AVUV**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/avuv/): Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF
* [**AVDV**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/avdv/): Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF
* [**QMOM**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/qmom/): Alpha Architect U.S. Quantitative Momentum ETF
* [**IMOM**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/imom/): Alpha Architect International Quantitative Momentum ETF

Here is what my equity portfolio would look like with the tilt:

* VTI = 45%
* AVUV = 9%
* QMOM = 6%
* VXUS = 30%
* AVDV = 6%
* IMOM = 4%

Besides the increased rebalancing difficulties and management fee of this new plan, my biggest concern is how much time I need to commit to it. Both [Rick Ferri](https://youtu.be/e7_MFyltNt4?t=415) and Wes Gray agreed that a tilted portfolio may require 25 years of commitment, due to its tracking error.

1ni8a6a,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 00:48:49,19m need some advice on my future.,"
Hey guys I'm 19, started investing this year I have 8k invested. I did my first year of university but I want to switch my major and drop out of my current university. If I drop out right now I'd only get a 50% refund from my school meaning I need to pay around 1.7k And Id need to pay my 5k loan back on top of that (if I don't drop out I don't need to pay that loan back for another 2 years) 

I have no idea what major id switch to but I didn't do grade 12 math cause I didn't need it for the major I'm currently in. This worries me because idk if I'll be able to get into another program and I might need to go to college instead or redo whatever Highschool courses I need to do. 

I was thinking that if I can just find a part time job and drop out of school I'll be able to afford to lose that 6.7k. But I feel like finding a part time job will be insanely hard and probably unlikely due to job shortage.

The thought I have in my head is to just work as much as I can, pay for school after the gap year and invest the rest of the money. I have no expenses since I am lucky enough to live with my parents. 

I have the idea in my head that you can become financially free by just working maybe even average paying job and putting 90% of the salary into investing until my compounding interest is more than my yearly contributions, then buy a small affordable apartment and eventually upgrade to something else and perhaps rent it out for extra income. 

Any tips? Is it unrealistic? Can you get financially free with any job? 

For some reason I'm really worried about my future and confused on what I want to do, but I do know that I want to invest as much money as I can. 

Anyone who tells me to just enjoy my life while I'm young, Its possible to do both isn't it?

* Risk factors include historically high stock valuations, mounting consumer debt, rising delinquencies, and inflation concerns pushing gold to record highs near $3,700

That will mean that the odds of a fed rate cut have gone up.

However, in both the shorter term and the longer term, it's not clear how things will work out. If the Trump supreme court upholds his right to fire at will which it has done in all the other cases, then he will still be able to stack the deck in short order. (and maybe intimidate the other governors).

I reached out to both advisors (partners) in May to invest the cash reserve part of my portfolio (16% is cash - and I wanted to invest about half of that), and they didn't respond and I forgot about. Now I see that practically any investment at that point would had have quite a few gains now. Google was 180, now 250 for example - one of the stocks I would have added. 

At a later date I asked them to sell Vital Farms stock (had a lot of gains in that one) and trade it for Google. They suggested to wait until earnings, and then sell.  After earnings, it Vital climbed to $50 and Google was at 200. Earnings came and went, and they didn't make that trade! Vital Farms is pretty much flat or lower now.

I understand brokers work to balance portfolios, and I do give mine the agency needed to make trades without contacting me for each and every one. However, I find this infuriating, seeing the gains that would have been made. On the flip side, I do see that there could have been losses / or it could remain flat as well, but I wanted to take my gains and move into another company that I see a lot of potential in.

1ni0ifz,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 18:40:04,I just had a fascinating conversation about US exceptionalism vis a vis our shift to 401k versus pensions,"This is going to be long and only for the hardcore investment nerds I think. I asked a question, namely, ""does the consistent, robotic, unemotional influx of money from US retirement investors (buying pressure) have a stabilizing effect on the US market and does it contribute to US exceptionalism. The answer is a resounding ""yes"" it would seem. 

1. The US market holds the largest share of investors on the planet. Over 50% of the entire globe's investors are US investors, representing trillions of dollars.

2. As a result, these steady, cyclical drips into the US markets (home bias: most US investors invest in US companies) provide a stabilizing effect on domestic stocks. Even in down markets, there is a constant drip-feed of millions buying stocks undriven by emotion. 

3. This constant, drip-fed influx of money (regardless of market conditions) provides US companies with an advantage in the form of cheap capital, that is then used for R&D, only further ensuring that US products and companies recieve the highest level of innovation

4. This entire dynamic contributes to a de facto ""moat"" around the US market allowing to better weather troughs in the economic cycle, and maintain an innovation advantage over international competitors, increasing US market performance. 

It made me realize that because of our shift from defined pensions (in the 80s) to defined contributions in individual stock portfolios was a ""happy accident"" of sorts when the first 401k was dreamt up in 1979. By adopting the 401k (or similar) as the de facto retirement vehicle for people, we also managed to create a ""self feeding beast"" of sorts in the US market. This machine-like drip feed of funds is a major factor in what we call US exceptionalism, and it more than likely will help perpetuate it going forward.

1nhy2zb,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 17:02:24,Arguments for and against international diversification,"I am currently in the process of reweighting and simplifying my portfolio. Around 85% of my holdings are in the USA, with 15% in developed international.

As of late, I have been considering reweighting this and potentially adding in emerging market exposure.

The US has outperformed international for some time now. I can see some reasons to believe that American Exceptionalism could continue.

1. Many American brands have a very high prestige around the world and can eat into international market share
2. Some American companies have a technological edge which will attract business from around the globe
3. The US has a very business-friendly climate and regulatory structure.
4. I see storm clouds on the horizon for many developed international markets, namely the birth rate crisis, sovereign debt issues, and business-hostile climate. Emerging markets similarly have their own problems, namely political risk, and environmental/climate issues.

However I can also see some basic arguments in favor of diversification:

1. Sure the US has outperformed in recent memory but that may be all the more reason for international stocks with more reasonable P/E ratios to outperform, moving forward.
2. The de-dollarization process has begun. [Foreign central banks now hold more Gold reserves than Treasuries for the first time in 30 years](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzrOr3jXEAA7pGm?format=jpg&name=medium) and the USA more generally is exhibiting signs of emerging market behavior. Rising populism from both parties, the erosion of Federal Reserve independence, a new push for more direct federal government management of the economy (tariffs, Intel, etc.), and the potential of monetizing the national debt all introduce a new set of risks and challenges for the US market.
3. Even with immigration, the US is not immune to the demographic problems plaguing the rest of the developed world. US deaths are expected to outpace births by 2031. Emerging markets have growing populations who are becoming educated and plugged into the internet at a breakneck pace.

Bryce C. Tingle, business law prof at U. of Calgary, writes;

> Over the past 30 years, the number of companies that sell shares on markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq has fallen by roughly 50 percent.  ... I have spent more than a decade trying to understand what is going on, and I have come to believe that the culprit is public company governance, the system in which many different groups, all pursuing their own agendas, generate rules for how public companies ought to be managed. These rules, norms and regulations — which tackle such issues as who gets to be a director, how executives should be paid, in what ways companies ought to respond to climate change — are constantly accruing and building on one another until this obscure process generates towering structures that, like a great coral reef, can tear out the bottom of a boat. 

> From 2000 to 2020, only about 10 percent of a thousand successful venture-capital-backed companies chose to go public.

Does this mean that regular investors are fighting for the scraps, leading to a bubble in the highly valued tech stocks that are publicly traded?

Google AI tells me that US private companies are worth $14T, vs $63T public market cap.  But if this $14T is concentrated in novel tech, it's significant.  On the other hand,  most private cap companies are small.  On the third hand, it's likely comparatively little value resides in the long tail of small companies, just like the SP500.   For example, Anthropic is estimated to be worth $180B, and that's from a funding round, which I would think prices it conservatively.


Counterargument: if there's a bubble in AI and other tech, and you have a successful private company, it makes sense to go public and exploit that bubble by selling shares to a starving market.  Then again, it might make more sense to sell it when it's bigger, so the little guys don't get the benefit of the first phases of expansion.",76,33,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nhtsh0/nyt_fewer_companies_going_public_because_of/,new,Unknown,0.79

1nhomjt,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 11:15:15,LENZ Therapeutics - A high risk high reward biotech company,"Hello r/investing true to my name I have a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is possibly easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read?” I was just like you when I first read that. Here is what I learned.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•Target population of the US is 128 million people

	•A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year

	•The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600

⸻

Company Financial Health: Good

	•Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•I am unable to determine if their creation of this drug is protected by some type of IP or patent

	•It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•Financial health could be pressured if they fail to scale in an economical way

	•Short Interest is 30% – it is irrelevant to my thesis on this product but something you should all be aware of

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter.

Again this is high risk and although my name would lead you to believe I only hold small cap. Majority of my own funds are in diversified ETFs.

I’ve been looking into silver recently as a potential investment, and I’m curious what the community thinks.

On one hand, it seems like silver has some solid fundamentals:

* It’s both a precious metal and an industrial metal (used in electronics, solar panels, medical tech, etc.).
* Historically, it’s seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.
* Compared to gold, it looks relatively undervalued right now.

On the other hand:

* Silver can be extremely volatile, sometimes even more than gold.
* Industrial demand could fluctuate depending on the economy.
* It doesn’t provide dividends or yield, so holding it is a pure bet on price appreciation.

I’m wondering: do you guys think silver is a smart play right now? Would you go for physical silver (coins, bars), ETFs, mining stocks, or avoid it altogether?",7,43,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nhmcfe/thinking_about_investing_in_silver_whats_your_take/,new,Unknown,0.65

IT & industrials
Even if AI will eventually flop, it's still going. However, with Mag7 valuations and EPS projections being far from perfect, I prefer looking at those who sell timber and iron to the shovel makers: COMM, STRL etc. 

Aerospace&Defense look really good considering ongoing conflicts and lack of tariff exposure.

Great sectors overall, but picking is a key. 

Comms
They are beating expectations harder what tech. Some great regional diversification, too, with VEON or IHS.


Materials
Despite a bull market, gold skyrocketed. Most of gold diggers though are still priced like an ounce is worth $2k, despite their margins are wide af. And with growing inflation, crappy bond yields, and high uncertainty, it's hard to imagine what could go wrong for gold. It's literally almost impossible to pick a bad stock there, an average gold stock has made 70% over a year. 


Financials
Banks should benefit from the falling interest rates. BNPL should benefit from this and reducing in consumer buying power. 


Energy
Nuclear is overbought, and oil seems to be on the downward trend, nothing to fish here. 


Consumer Staples
Not a bad choice with purchase power dropping. I really like CALM, for instance


Consumer Discretionary
Not sure I get a point why invest into them. Tech/Comms/Industrials will do better in a bull market, and this sector will be hurt just as much in the bear market. 


Utilities
Kinda same as with energy, I don't see green to be taking cash. I do like SBS though. Maybe hidden tech stocks like VTOL


Healthcare
I don't believe in biotech at large, but some pragmatic things like hospitals or telemedicine could be great


REIT
Nah, not with BBB :)

I felt I would quit job in first few years and open a business but never materialized, so I kept living life on autopilot, just doing 9-5. In covid, i started taking interest watching lot of news about stock rocketing. I opened brokerage account and started investing, in doing so sold my employer RSU feeling it'll drop but it only double after I sold. Then to catch up for time lost, I taking big bets, invested 700k in various stocks and SPUS, but in August 2024 when trump announced tarriffs, lost 10% and panicked and sold losing 70k in cash. Then again mustered courage, and invested in Feb 2025, again tarriffs were announced, lost 20k. Then have been away from market ever since.

I also bought house all cash in 2023, as felt i have so much cash why should I do mortgage (also am against borrowing money on interest), but sadly house didn't appreciated, I bought in Austin, rather price dropped from price I bought. I feel as much I chase for parking money watching everyone multiply their savings, more I'm losing money. Till date not only I have lost appreciation by not investing in SP500 over years but have lot 90k in cash value of money and some 10ks of dollars in house. I am not complaining as I'm lucky to earn this but also wish to earn passive income or see appreciation so can save money for my family. I see people who don't have passive income or savings invested have to work till late age in life even if they don't like it.

How do I start now, SP500 has been breaking record every other week for last few months. But with global events unfolding every week, if I put my entire life savings into them, how do I navigate if a recession hits?

1nh8zz6,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 21:37:53,Housing Market to Crash?  …It’s Complicated.,"Since 2021, I’ve been hearing a lot of talk on a housing market bubble. 

I’m here to say, with incredible confidence, that I’m actually not confident about where housing prices will find themselves in the coming years…at all. BUT I don’t think this disqualifies me from offering some insight for you other brave souls to carry the torch where I’ve stumbled in the dark. 

I built two important models, today, both of which can completely justify the median home price at current interest rates… and argue against it entirely. 

The current market prices seem “allowable” if I’m allowed to assume that the market projects a rate fall from the 6s to the low 3s. Then it makes sense. 
Let’s start with the home values current. Some estimates put median home prices for 2025 around 410k and other are as high as 440k.  I believe Zillow has a figure around 380k. So, for all intents and purposes, I like 410k. 

Whether or not these prices are deeply overpriced really come down to just what the average interest rates should look like over the next 30 years from here. And I did a little ‘mathing’ to prove that.

I regressed the monthly payment per square footage of median-priced homes over the last 30 years. This model assumes a 10% down payment, then incorporates average interest rates of each period to derive monthly payment.. then divides by square footage of median sized home in each year (took forever to find). 

From that trend line, we can see that the market mean for 2025 would have the payment per square ft at 72 cents. 
Converting that into a monthly payment brings us to around $1600/ month for principal and interest. 

All the to say the trend from 1995 to 2025 would reasonably have someone pay that. Given today’s interest rates, that would then price the projected home value for 2025 around 290-300k. 
Now that’s not the national average, is it? 
No. Absolutely not. Should we be upset? Well, hang on..

Here’s why that figure still might be a gross underestimation of how the market ‘should’ price homes: 
It doesn’t factor in the potential for refinancing. 

If the market broadly accepts interest rates to hover around 6-6.5% for the next 30 years, then we would probably see homes take on lower prices. But we haven’t. So somewhere baked in, there must be a presumption of what long term interest will look like moving forward. 

So, I started playing around with the figures and reset the objective of finding what interest rate the market would imply, assuming that the home prices today are priced perfect. 
So I plugged in the median home price today (410k) combined with the market’s regression of monthly payments (normalized to square footage) and got back 3.22%…ish. 

The question from here is, which idea sounds crazier? 
Is it crazier to think interest rates moving outward will effectively be around 3.22%, or is it crazier to think that homes are selling for a 40-45% premium? 

In one world, interest rates would have to be cut in half in the next few years and in another world housing prices would have to either stagnate for a decade or fall by 30% in the next year. 


Now, I understand no model is perfect, and mine is really not factoring in any nuances experienced in this year vs any other, but it certainly stands on principle. That principle is “Something has to give”.

So, what do you think? Are we in a bubble? Have prices climbed with inflation? Can we reasonably expect lower interest rates? Can we expect a major correction?

However, never in our history have we had so much market wealth concentrated among middle to upper-class Boomers, who are going to liquidate their holdings as they go through retirement. This is further exacerbated by the polls showing that many Boomers don't intend to leave wealth for their children.

My question is: will this create a new semi-permanent drag on the market, given the sheer magnitude of the 401K withdrawals? Of course I understand that there are more working-age people adding to the 401Ks than senior citizens pulling money out. However, the withdrawals will end up canceling out a substantial proportion of the investments, from what I understand. And it makes me thing that the 8% average growth will be tough to keep up given that pervasive drag.

1ngal7f,2025-09-13,2025-09-13 18:25:40,AMZN covered calls free money?!,"We have some vested AMZN RSUs that have been pretty stagnant but I’m bullish on the company and we’re plenty diversified so we’re holding. 




About a month ago I was reading some covered call strategies and AMZN stood out as a decent company to sell covered calls on. So I tried it weekly for the last month, on Friday I’d sell a CC for the next Friday from $130-248 each. After rolling the cost and putting aside some money for the tax man I came out with about $440. That’s just under 2% return for the month. 



If I do this every month and let the cash sit in a money market or reinvest I come out with a pretty healthy profit. Now I just have the 100 shares so it is a bit of effort for just $440/mn but we have more vesting soon and once we get 200-300 shares that’s not bad. 




Here’s where it’s free money:


1. I’ll get this out of the way: I’m completely fine if these get called and I have to sell. It’s been an underperformed and was “free” to begin with. I’m not expecting amzn to have a crazy week and I miss out on a double. 




2. I’ve been selling 232.5 and 235 calls. Amazon has struggled to pass the $240 and only a few times in the last year did it get to $235+ making it fairly unlikely for it then to be called.



3. AMZN shouldn’t have many unexpected upside moves, it’s just not historically likely. Making it somewhat safe. However it does tend to float between $215-230 meaning this should be a fairly sustainable approach for me to keep doing every week or two.




I’m not sure if I’m missing something obvious? Like the biggest risks are losing out on future gains of the shares if it gets called and taxes right? But the taxes are factored in and the return is still decent and the future gains I’m just not particularly worried about and it seems I’d be able to buy back in. I’m genuinely open to advice if I’m fucking something up, but I don’t think I am and it seems like a solid strategy.

August deliveries were \~40 % down YoY. 2nd quarter results were not as bad as that, but still nothing good. The deliveries for Q2 were only \~2% higher YoY. 4.5 % declined revenue, net income essentially flat.

However, they guided for Q3 deliveries and revenue to decline \~40% YoY!

Finally, their upcoming models don't bode very well, IMO. Their BEV models don't look very interesting aesthetically--in fact, kind of ugly. The upcoming i6 seems to look alright but nothing special. I'm not seeing how they're going to compete well in the extremely competitive Chinese market if Chinese consumers continue shifting to BEVs, and that's the area that Li Auto seems least competitive in. They achieved a lot of growth on hybrids, but their BEV models have been relatively unsuccessful so far. But the future lies in EVs, I think. I don't see how Li's competitiveness is going to improve with boring-looking cars, when Chinese consumers have so many other options to find good value propositions.

So, I don't get it. Why has this stock not collapsed more? It's trading at about the same price as at the end of April. At that time it was delivering \~35k vehicles/month, compared to \~28k in August.

Li Auto themselves predict that their next quarter will be terrible, with 40% YoY declines in deliveries and revenue.

I admit to a lot of ignorance about how the funds actually implement hedging strategies, but are they bi directional or are they just implemented to insure against downside currency risk from the dollar perspective?  That is, if an international bond paying interest in Euros is hedged now and the dollar is falling, does the hedging effectively make performance worse from the dollar perspective?

1nfwv0f,2025-09-13,2025-09-13 08:58:13,Your sustainable fund might not be what you think it is,"A massive academic review of sustainable investing research uncovered something concerning: recent studies show many funds labeled as ""sustainable"" or ""ESG"" actually contain companies with significant ESG controversies.

The research analyzed nearly 1,000 papers spanning 35 years and found that while sustainable investing exploded after 2015, the methods for screening companies remain surprisingly primitive. Most research relies on backward-looking data rather than predictive analysis, and there's virtually no use of modern technology to detect or prevent greenwashing.

This matters for individual investors because you might think you're investing ethically while inadvertently funding practices you oppose. The fund labels and ESG ratings we rely on appear to have significant blind spots.

The study suggests we're in the early stages of sustainable investing - like the dial-up era of ESG. The infrastructure for truly effective sustainable screening is still being built.

If you're investing in ESG funds, this research suggests doing additional due diligence beyond just trusting the label or rating. The field is evolving rapidly, but current methods may not be as reliable as they appear.

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?

I’ve been frustrated with how most stock coverage just recycles the same tickers, while interesting plays highlighted by the retail community don’t get a clean, digestible deep dive. So I started a tiny project called[ OneDailyStock.com](https://onedailystock.com).

The idea is simple: each day it highlights one stock that seems to have strong potential but balanced risk, based on what the retail community is noticing. Today’s pick is Rocket Lab for example, and the writeup goes into the company overview, investment thesis, bull/base/bear cases, key catalysts, sentiment, and a look at earnings and technicals.

It’s not a paid product, just something I built for myself because I wanted a quick, structured way to think about interesting plays, and I figured some others might find it useful.

I’d love feedback, is this kind of breakdown useful? Anything you think is missing or should be added? ",6,7,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nen19s/i_built_a_tool_to_spotlight_one_community_stock/,new,Unknown,0.88

1nejleo,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 16:25:59,Thoughts on ANGX (Angel Studios) as a Long-Term Play?,"As a few of you know, angel Studios, a streaming company went live on the stock market today.

I’ve been digging into ANGX (Angel Studios) now that it’s newly public, and I’m curious what others think about this one in its early days.

A few things caught my attention:

In less than a year, Angel Studios grew its Guild membership from 600,000 to 1.5 million.

That kind of subscriber growth feels exponential and, in some ways, comparable to Netflix in its early expansion phase.

The company already has a proven track record of producing surprise hits (e.g. Sound of Freedom, homestead and others), and if they can keep scaling content and membership, the upside could be massive.

I’m not saying this is a guaranteed rocket ship. nothing is, but if Angel continues on this trajectory, it could be a 10× in the next decade or two. Some even think it could become one of those rare 100× companies, but obviously that’s speculation.

Right now, I’m mainly shooting for the 10× potential and want to hear what others think:

Do you see ANGX as a serious long-term hold?

Is anyone else planning to buy in or build a position and just let it ride for years?

Or do you think the hype fades and the business model isn’t sustainable at scale?

Would love to hear different takes especially from those who invest in high-growth, early-stage public companies.",12,33,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nejleo/thoughts_on_angx_angel_studios_as_a_longterm_play/,new,Unknown,0.81

I’ve been pretty skeptical about Oracle’s surge, but they are about to recognize a lot of revenues. This market reaction is interesting because so far, the “big AI” bets were companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, Google, Meta, Broadcom, etc. Oracle, by contrast, has long been seen as more of a legacy play, focused on infrastructure for large enterprises.

What we’re seeing is that investors still go crazy for AI, especially when an established, “old guard” player gets involved. Is this an overreaction? Hard to say. Ideally, markets should value not just AI mentions and vision, but the actual value being unlocked. Maybe that’s exactly what’s being priced in here or maybe it’s an over- or underreaction, since we still don’t fully understand what AI will ultimately deliver.

Ofc there is lot more to Oracle than this but still im very curiousy

I'm thinking of re-allocating my portfolio so that more of the cash is kept within tax advantaged accounts - specifically my Roth IRA - as otherwise taxes eat away at the interest (I'm in a high bracket).

* Buy $10,000 VTI in Brokerage.
* Sell $10,000 VTI in Roth
* Buy $10,000 T-Bill in Roth.

Downsides are that I probably lose a buck or two to the bid ask spread.

1nf46bi,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 10:06:01,Is Oracle just SoftBank wearing a mask?,"Let me get this straight:

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?

Fed governor Stephen Miran preferred to cut rates by a half a percentage point and disagreed with the quarter percentage cut.

The Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point with a landslide 11-to-1 vote, setting the target range between 4% and 4.25%.  The 1 vote dissented from Miran, favoring a larger 50-basis-point cut instead.

The **decision of a 25 BP cut** was based mainly on the following:

* **Labor market concerns** with recent job gains have slowed significantly, and the unemployment rate has edged up.
* **Economic slowdown** with indicators suggests economic activity grew at a more moderate pace in the first half of the year.
* **Acknowledged inflation** remains somewhat elevated, but the Fed judged that the rising downside risks to employment warranted a rate cut. 

Officials signaled the possibility of **two more rate cuts** this year.

1npncdh,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 16:38:02,Be careful with quantum stocks,"I'm an engineer, and my sphere of competence is technology. I'm a believer in quantum computers. Here's why I think it's a bad idea to invest in quantum stocks.

You see, a successful business is not determined by how advanced the technology is, but by its ability to generate a pile of money. Business, first of all, is a cash generator. And we, as investors, want to own great cash generators. The problem with quantum stocks is that none of them are great businesses (aside from maybe IBM and Google, which aren't really ""quantum stocks"").

Let's put aside the complexity of quantum computing and how difficult it is to scale. Let's assume we've solved all technical issues. Do you know how much it costs to build and maintain a quantum solution? Do you know how much it would cost to develop commercialized mass-manufacturing? To educate the personnel? The answer: a freaking unimaginable amount.
  
There's no company in Taiwan that will print you quantum chips on demand. There aren't millions of quantum engineers and software programmers waiting to be employed. The infrastructure does not exist. Quantum technology won't be scalable for decades - maybe half a century.
  
You can't even compare quantum to the AI revolution. AI is still silicon-based and can reuse existing infrastructure. Quantum technology reimagines our entire approach to computing from scratch. And it costs a hell of a lot of money (tons of debt, none of profit).

None of the companies on the market will dominate the quantum space. They're not businesses - they're research labs (and some are scams). The companies that will eventually build infrastructure, hire engineers, and scale to the market don't exist yet.

Technology doesn't mean business. Research doesn't mean cash. And sadly, even established companies with fully built infrastructure and strong brands can fail as businesses (sorry, Intel, I'm talking about you).

See how absurd it is that current quantum stocks already have billions in market cap, sitting alongside successful businesses? These companies print flashy news releases and talk big about how quantum will change everything. They exploit public ignorance about technology to sell wet dreams stuffed with money bags. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Your money will soon end up in the pockets of insiders and hedge funds.

This is a reality check not just for quantum stocks, but for tech hype in general. Think twice where you put your money. Maybe it's better to take your profit, consider yourself lucky, and buy your girlfriend flowers or a house?

Not investment advice, of course, but I'd rather put a smile on a girl's face than invest in quantum. ;)

P.S.
When in doubt, trust fundamentals, not your biases. Don't fool yourself into thinking you would've picked Nvidia in 2015 if you only had the information available in 2015. Today is the same - you don't know who's going to be the champ in 2035. It will surprise us all.

The BLS has already laid off so many employees that Jerome Powell questions the validity of the data. I really think alot of the jobs being created aren’t even good jobs, previously done by undocumented immigrants or healthcare jobs that aren’t high paying like nursing home assistant. The current pick is talking about suspending the intervals of reports or just changing how to demonstrate the data to make it look good. Potentially having a federal reserve that isn’t independent and who lowers interest rates while having more inflation. On top of an economy that is slowing primarily due to tariffs and general fear of doing business in the country.

The stock market doing well doesn’t correlate with the economy doing well but eventually they have to meet reality at some point right, otherwise crashes like 2008 wouldn’t happen.

In summary, they think the value of the US dollar is being repriced against gold, a trend that has happened twice before in history (1970-1980 and 1999-2011), when the dollar lost 90% of its purchasing power against gold. A rise in gold prices often coincides with systemic economic issues and a rising US unemployment rate because a weakening economy prompts the government to lower interest rates and increase spending, which makes the US dollar and Treasury bonds less attractive to investors.

While gold prices are currently rising, the unemployment rate is still low. This is attributed to three reasons:

1/Global Geopolitical Uncertainty: Governments and central banks are diversifying into gold as a safe-haven asset.

2/Devaluing Government Policies: The US government is running a large budget deficit, and the Federal Reserve has been cutting interest rates, which are policies that typically devalue the currency and lead investors to gold.

3/Anticipation of Future Recession: Gold's rise may be in anticipation of a future recession, as consumer confidence is low despite the low unemployment rate.

TLDR: Although stocks may continue to rise in the short term, gold is likely to continue outperforming them.

1nrrne6,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 06:17:01,Is Google still cheap? 10 year expected returns,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better.

However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it.

When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value.  
After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years.

From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500.

Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations.

Anyways here are the results:

FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR  
EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR  
Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR

So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price?  
Probably not.

Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs.

That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding.

Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels.

1nsgvd0,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 02:06:56,You are not bullish enough on magnets,"You probably already know that the rare earth mineral **neodymium** is used in humanoid robots and we are expecting billions of these machines in the future.

You likely also know that these magnets are used in advanced aerospace technologies and electric vehicles.

But what you probably didn’t know is that they will play a critical role in the new wave of drone and defence technologies which are due for a massive overhaul.

Neodymium is the leading option but Iron-Nitride is expected to surpass this when production increases in the long term. So although robots will eventually move over to the more sustainable Iron-Nitride magnets, there is still going to be huge near-term demand from advanced military and transport technology.

If we look at expected demand versus supply over the next 10 years, we have a lot to be bullish about. The mineral is up 50% this year, but this is a decade long bet and you are still early for this.

if demand is truly about to “double,” why would the biggest ai chip supplier on the planet be guaranteeing empty racks?

answer: current demand is uneven. frontier labs (openai, meta, etc) are burning compute, but enterprise adoption is way slower. workloads are lumpy. nvidia is hedging against slowdown *right now*.

Part of the learning curve is recognizing the fact that a share price can decrease, without ANY fundamental change in the company. The company can absolutely obliterate all expectations, and the ""share price"" can still drop. 
My point is, I sold many lots early because I was new, and impatient. 
I've learned two things. 1- DCA all day. 2- if you believe in the companies fundamentals and nothing has changed, then do not react to outside influence. Do not sell, continue to DCA all day. 
Off the top of my head, I sold: RIG at 0.64, MP at 18, IONQ at 9, ZDGE at 2.4, WD at 43, INTC at 26, RGTI at 8, NOTE at 2, CARR at 55, GME at 13 (PRIOR TO THE SHORT), NIO at 4, ON at 30, RR at 1.40,  ERIC at 3.3, XOM at 60, GE at 130 (13 pre split), UPST at 19, MU at 50, TTD - i sold at 561, but its been RSd and I dont know today's equivalent. 

 All of those above are higher today, than my sell price. Also, when I sold, at whatever time, with the exception of WD and CARR (they where green, but nothing crazy) they where in the red, for sure. The moral of the story was, nothing changed. I sold due to a reaction of the market, NOT, the company. 
Here's the kicker. I'm still up 300% overall  and 1000%+ percent lots, because I learned my lesson. I identified my error, ( I used to panic )
I swallowed that lesson. Took it in stride, and made the change. I stuck with PLTR ( at its worse, down 90+ percent) , RKLB (worst , down 88+) , PL (down 60%). And have been DCA all day, and don't watch the day-to-day. The companies are execution, nothing has changed fundamentally, and the outcome has been nothing but amazing. The result? Today , I'm in the green 300%+ overall. Why? I identified my errors, and key point. ACCEPTED IT AS TRUE. Make the change. And win. (FYI I'm currently down 20% on LIDR, but, I cannot do my job without LIDAR, so for me, the need is there. Company fundamentals haven't changed, ill continue to DCA)

1npzzyt,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 03:03:11,"Why is a 2% mortgage a ""great"" business for a bank when other investments seem way better?","I'm having trouble understanding the logic of why a bank would lend someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for a 30-year mortgage at a very low interest rate (say, 2%). As an individual investor, this seems like a terrible return, especially when safer assets like government bonds sometimes offer even higher yields.



I've heard all the simple answers, but none of them seem to fully hold up. My doubts are:



\- The ""Spread"" Argument: People say banks profit on the spread between the interest they pay on deposits and the interest they earn on the loan. But I understand banks create money when they lend, not just lend out existing deposits. So why create money for a low-return mortgage instead of for something more profitable?



\- The ""Low-Risk"" Argument: The loan is secured by a house, making it low-risk. But there have been times when long-term government bonds were both safer and had a higher yield than mortgages. Yet banks kept issuing mortgages. This can't be the only reason.



\- The ""It's the Law"" Argument: The final answer I get is that banks are legally forbidden from creating money to buy bonds? Okay, but that feels like a circular argument. It doesn't explain why the entire financial and regulatory system is seemingly built to make mortgages the absolute best, most profitable thing a bank can do with its unique power to create credit???



I feel like the real answer involves something deeper. Can anyone explain the real, non-simplified rationale here?",192,391,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npzzyt/why_is_a_2_mortgage_a_great_business_for_a_bank/,month,Unknown,0.79

1nsa2sl,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 19:57:05,You can't beat the market by buying good companies for the same reason you can’t get rich betting on the best football teams,"The idea that information is “priced in” is a notoriously tricky concept for new investors (I know I struggled with it for a while), and it occurred to me that a sports betting analogy might help.

You can go out and bet on who is going to win tomorrow's NFL games, but for most of those games, there's a lot of information out there that leads people to expect that one team is more likely to win. Take, for example, tomorrow's Bills-Saints game. There's a lot of information suggesting that the Bills are a much better team, and are much more likely than the Saints to win. As a result, if you want to bet that the Bills will win, you're not going to find someone who will take the other side of that bet straight up.

To get someone to take the other side of the bet, you have to concede something: either give them better odds (ie they get a bigger payout if their unlikely bet pays off), or a spread, meaning a number of points that the favored team must win by for the bet to pay out (in this example, the Bills have to win by at least 15 tomorrow, if they win by 7, the people who bet on the Saints get the money). The expectation that the Bills are going to win is priced in, the odds or spread adjust until equal numbers of people are willing to take either side of the bet.

The stock market works the same way. There's a lot of information that leads people to expect that Apple will continue to grow and perform much better than the average company. As a result, to get someone to agree to sell you an Apple share, you have to pay a high price: 35 times Apple's current earnings per share (compared to an average of about 26.6 times for the US stock market as a whole). If everyone expects Apple to do better as a company than the market in general, the price of the stock will rise until there's an equal number of buyers and sellers. The expectation that Apple will have above average earnings in the future is already priced in, just like the expectation that the Bills will beat the Saints.

Everyone agrees the Bills will probably beat the Saints. To bet on it, you need to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. Everyone agrees Apple will probably have better earnings than the average company. To bet on it (ie buying Apple shares instead of a total market index fund), you have to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. You can't get rich betting on teams that everyone knows are good, and you can't beat the market buying companies that everyone knows are good. Available information is priced in.

Edit: I stopped watching football a while back, so the fact that the Bills are -14.5 vs the Saints is wild to me.

Edit2: If you think you have a method for finding mispriced stocks, that’s not necessarily in conflict with my point here. The point is that it’s more complicated than simply buying companies widely regarded as good, in contrast to what new investors often assume. (That said I do tend to be skeptical that retail investors can expect to find a market-beating strategy)

Edit 3: the Bills won 31-19, meaning that they won the game but did not cover the spread, and people who put money on the Saints won.",163,127,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nsa2sl/you_cant_beat_the_market_by_buying_good_companies/,month,Unknown,0.75

Is This the End of the Road for AMD or a New Era of Competition?,"seismic event just happened in the semiconductor world, and it has major implications for investors. NVIDIA and Intel announced a historic collaboration, with NVIDIA investing $5 billion in Intel and forming a joint venture to co-develop new chips for AI and personal computing.

This partnership is a big deal because it brings together two of the biggest players in the industry, which immediately sent shockwaves through the market. While Intel's stock saw a massive jump of up to 30%, competitors like AMD saw their shares drop by over 9% in initial trading.

Analysts are now debating the long-term impact on the competitive landscape.

1) For AMD: The concern is that the new partnership could create a powerful, integrated offering that directly challenges AMD's products in both the data center and consumer markets. This move may put pressure on AMD to accelerate its own product launches and strategies.

2) For the Alliance: The deal could be seen as a way for Intel to get a much-needed lifeline and a direct path into the AI space, while NVIDIA gains a massive partner to expand its ecosystem.

1ni0ifz,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 18:40:04,I just had a fascinating conversation about US exceptionalism vis a vis our shift to 401k versus pensions,"This is going to be long and only for the hardcore investment nerds I think. I asked a question, namely, ""does the consistent, robotic, unemotional influx of money from US retirement investors (buying pressure) have a stabilizing effect on the US market and does it contribute to US exceptionalism. The answer is a resounding ""yes"" it would seem. 

1. The US market holds the largest share of investors on the planet. Over 50% of the entire globe's investors are US investors, representing trillions of dollars.

2. As a result, these steady, cyclical drips into the US markets (home bias: most US investors invest in US companies) provide a stabilizing effect on domestic stocks. Even in down markets, there is a constant drip-feed of millions buying stocks undriven by emotion. 

3. This constant, drip-fed influx of money (regardless of market conditions) provides US companies with an advantage in the form of cheap capital, that is then used for R&D, only further ensuring that US products and companies recieve the highest level of innovation

4. This entire dynamic contributes to a de facto ""moat"" around the US market allowing to better weather troughs in the economic cycle, and maintain an innovation advantage over international competitors, increasing US market performance. 

It made me realize that because of our shift from defined pensions (in the 80s) to defined contributions in individual stock portfolios was a ""happy accident"" of sorts when the first 401k was dreamt up in 1979. By adopting the 401k (or similar) as the de facto retirement vehicle for people, we also managed to create a ""self feeding beast"" of sorts in the US market. This machine-like drip feed of funds is a major factor in what we call US exceptionalism, and it more than likely will help perpetuate it going forward.

tracking my actual behavior. Was checking my portfolio obsessively and making impulsive trades during every market swing.

Decided to try automated strategies as an experiment in removing emotions from investing. Took some research to find platforms I trusted but eventually connected my accounts and stepped back. 6 months later the results speak for themselves. Account is up 23% compared to 9% during the same period last year when I was actively managing everything. Fewer trades but way better timing and execution.

More importantly learned how much mental energy constant portfolio monitoring was consuming. Didn't realize how stressed I was until I stopped checking prices every hour. Work focus improved, relationship with family got better, started exercising regularly again. Biggest surprise was how much better the automated system handled market volatility. During the October selloff I would have panic sold everything. Instead the system kept executing strategies and recovered quickly while I slept peacefully.

Took about a month to break the habit of obsessive checking. Had to delete broker apps from my phone temporarily. Now I review performance maybe twice per week maximum. Still maintaining some individual stock positions for fun but the bulk of serious money is automated now. Scratches the stock picking itch without jeopardizing systematic returns.

Healthcare +31 ▲ rising (but below average)

Social Assistance +16 ▲ steady growth

Federal Government –15 ▼ continued decline

Mining/Oil/Gas –6 ▼ flat after 12 months

Wholesale Trade –12 ▼ down 32,000 since May

Manufacturing –12 ▼ down 78,000 YOY

If the Fed still maintains its professionalism, it should realize that the industries hit hardest in this NFP report wouldn’t benefit at all from a rate cut.

Manufacturing: the primary target of tariffs, costly imported materials have destroyed its competitiveness, cutting rates to zero wouldn’t help

Wholesale Trade: pricing has lost its anchor + weighing whether to absorb costs + Trump could add new tariffs at any time = a completely unpredictable policy outlook that keeps employers from hiring

Federal Government: government fiscal allocation issues

This is clearly a recession caused by structural factors, and if they cut rates now, it would turn into man made stagflation.

For context, I'm a physician and my wife is a professor. She started working at age 26 and has had a couple of retirement funds through old jobs, though we didn't really focus on them and I think just put enough in them to get the employer match. I started working around age 34.

We've been maxing out our retirement plans since 2018 and put it all in Life Cycle funds. I didn't know that I had any other option. I JUST learned on Thursday that I could invest that money in ETFs if I want. I just had no clue. I've also had our ""emergency fund"" sitting in a savings account getting 0.25% :(

The other day I was looking at all of our retirement accounts -- my wife has 2 from previous jobs, 1 with her current job, and I have 2 with my current jobs -- and the balance is a little over $1m. 

Which is exciting as someone who didn't really grow up with much, but also a little disappointing now that I'm learning that I could have been doing a lot better.

I'm starting to rebalance the accounts to be more aggressive. We're both 25ish years away from retirement, so I want to see it grow as much as possible. It's like being handed a million dollars and being told to go nuts.

Bryce C. Tingle, business law prof at U. of Calgary, writes;

> Over the past 30 years, the number of companies that sell shares on markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq has fallen by roughly 50 percent.  ... I have spent more than a decade trying to understand what is going on, and I have come to believe that the culprit is public company governance, the system in which many different groups, all pursuing their own agendas, generate rules for how public companies ought to be managed. These rules, norms and regulations — which tackle such issues as who gets to be a director, how executives should be paid, in what ways companies ought to respond to climate change — are constantly accruing and building on one another until this obscure process generates towering structures that, like a great coral reef, can tear out the bottom of a boat. 

> From 2000 to 2020, only about 10 percent of a thousand successful venture-capital-backed companies chose to go public.

Does this mean that regular investors are fighting for the scraps, leading to a bubble in the highly valued tech stocks that are publicly traded?

Google AI tells me that US private companies are worth $14T, vs $63T public market cap.  But if this $14T is concentrated in novel tech, it's significant.  On the other hand,  most private cap companies are small.  On the third hand, it's likely comparatively little value resides in the long tail of small companies, just like the SP500.   For example, Anthropic is estimated to be worth $180B, and that's from a funding round, which I would think prices it conservatively.


Counterargument: if there's a bubble in AI and other tech, and you have a successful private company, it makes sense to go public and exploit that bubble by selling shares to a starving market.  Then again, it might make more sense to sell it when it's bigger, so the little guys don't get the benefit of the first phases of expansion.",82,33,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nhtsh0/nyt_fewer_companies_going_public_because_of/,month,Unknown,0.8

Most investors on the internet talks about the expected 10% annual return, based on historical returns.  
But is that true for the market today?

Historically the market is much cheaper than today, many investors seem not to care about valuations, and think AI will make explosive growth which will justify current valuations. However, we have a P/E over 31, and a Shiller P/E over 40, history tells us this won't end pretty.

Lets look at the numbers and model out the scenarios, to see what we can expect for returns.  
For this model we need a low, medium and high terminal P/E (what P/E will the S&P 500 end at in 10 years)  
and we need low, medium and high estimated earnings growth numbers.

Historically P/E has a median of 15, this is too low since it goes back to the 1800s, but in the past 50 years, the P/E median is \~20, in the past 20 and 10 years, it's \~25.

So let's go with:

* low: 20
* mid: 25
* high: 30

For growth estimations I looked at the past 20 years of earnings, 50% of the years were below or equal to 4% CAGR, which means this is most likely, and 20% of the years were above or equal to 8% CAGR.

To give some room for more expected growth, let's go with:

* low: 4%
* mid: 6.5%
* high 10% (only seen 4 times since 1880)

*(Note: these aren’t conservative.)*

We now can get the terminal value:

Terminal value = current EPS \* (expected growh rate)\^10 years  
current EPS = 219.52

From here we can see what Compounded Annual Growth Rate will get to the current share price from the terminal value in 10 years. For my estimations I get the following annual returns from the estimations:

* high: \~9% annual return
* mid: \~4.7% annual return
* low: \~1% annual return

This shows another picture of what is preached about 10% annual returns.

The S&P 500 is priced for perfection. But perfection almost never happens. At current valuations, investors are betting on a decade of above-average growth. Growth that history tells us is unlikely to materialize, and the assumptions are based on hype.

1niyk3r,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 20:25:30,"IONQ and other Quantum stocks are rising insanely, is it worth to invest?","I noticed IONQ's presentation on investors' day, and they shared some information about achieving targets, and also had one slide where they presented the revenue, which is doubling every year. But if you look at the expenses, they are much more than the revenue they are generating. I understand it is a growth company, but I am not sure of the complete technology. So, I am trying to get some insights and want to check if you guys are aware or have any idea what they are talking about. Similarly, I noticed RGTI, QUBT, and QBTS are all going up.

|Period|Revenue|Operating Cash Flow (or Cash Flow from Operating Activities)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Q2 2025 (quarter ended June 30, 2025)**|**US$20.7 million**|**US$-85.6 million**|
|Q1 2025|Q1 revenue is $7.57 million|**US$**\-33M|
|**Full Year 2024**|**US$43.07 million**|**− US$105.68 million** approximately   operating cash flow|
|**Full Year 2023**|**US$22.04 million**|**US$-78.81 million**\~   operating cash flow|
|**Full Year 2022**|**US$11.13 million**|**US$-44.70 million**\~   operating cash flow|

I understand NVDA has gone through the same cycle at one point, but as Jensen mentioned, he was just lucky that AI happened and GPUs were useful. I am not sure if Quantum is anywhere near. It takes more than 3 years as IONQ has presented to commercialize, and I'm not sure if there is an actual application that can leverage the technology fully.

Thanks for your valuable feedback.

Updated: IonQ reported a net loss of $177.5 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $36.5 million.

With all the acquisitions and compensation to more leadership teams, losses are expected to increase to $ 250 million per quarter.

To acquire Oxford Ionic, IONQ paid $1.065 billion in IONQ common stock and $10 million in cash. So, basically, the stockholders have already been diluted.

2) The Valuation Paradox: I've heard Powell acknowledge that ""equity prices are fairly highly valued,"" and that seems to be driving the current U.S. market pullback. We're at a moment of uncertainty and consolidation.

3) The Global Split: Meanwhile, I've seen Chinese tech stocks continue a record-breaking rally, completely divorced from our market's concerns.

What's your take on this? Does the sheer size of the AI buildout make the U.S. market immune to an underlying correction, or is this all just on ""highly overstretched valuation""?

we are currently approx. 80/20   mostly large cap growth funds/cash.

Would like to adjust our investments to minimize losses when the crash happens while still staying invested.

I keep reading that the market is at all time highs and that a significant correction is coming soon.

I get that you can't time the market so moving funds out of our large cap growth funds with the intention of moving back into them after the crash is probably not a sound plan?

The only option I see that makes any sense is to move from our large cap grow funds into lower risk/return funds that won't get hit so hard when the crash happens and staying put in those lower risk/return funds.

It seems like the risk/return calculation for bonds is not very good. Ideas to keep our investments growing while reducing risk?

How do you decide if/when to sell and move it into something more stable? Or, do you just hold and say your prayers? 

The stock I am currently pondering is OKLO. It went up 28% yesterday, and all indications are that it will continue to grow now that there is all this attention on nuclear energy. But- nuclear stocks tend to be volatile depending on politics and current events. Not to mention the reality that as soon as anything goes wrong with nuclear production (meltdown, etc) it will likely tank the stock prices and be down a long time. 

Very curious what folks think. TIA.

I ended up selling enough of my OKLO shares to cover my original investment and left the rest, am just gonna let it go for now and do what it will do. The intense fluctuations were stressful but now that it’s all just shares generated from profit I am less concerned. 

I’ve been looking into nuclear stocks that feel less risky and speculative. I went with Constellation Energy (CEG) and NuScale (SMR). Both are further along than OKLO, CEG is already building plants for Microsoft and SMR is a startup like OKLO but has federal regulatory approval.

Key sentences: 

* ""Our vision is simple: we want to create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week.""
* ""... it will require innovation at every level of the stack, from chips to power to building to robotics.""
* ""We are particularly excited to build a lot of this in the US; right now, other countries are building things like chips fabs and new energy production much faster than we are, and we want to help turn that tide.""
* ""Over the next couple of months, we’ll be talking about some of our plans and the partners we are working with to make this a reality.""

Any guesses on who they'll partner with mainly? I'm not super into the end-to-end AI infra space but here's what our good friend ChatGPT says are the main areas:

* **Energy generation & supply:** To scale to gigawatt-per-week growth, you need lots of cheap, reliable, low-carbon or zero-carbon power. Also, grid/interconnection infrastructure must handle large loads.
* **Chips / accelerators / custom hardware:** GPUs, TPUs, ASICs, other accelerators for training & inference.
* **Data center / facility design:** Physical buildings, racks, layout, power distribution, mechanical infrastructure (cooling, ventilation), modularity, robotics for construction etc.
* **Cooling / thermal management & power delivery:**  GPUs and accelerators produce lots of heat; cooling strategies (air, liquid, immersion) become critical.
* **Networking & storage / I/O / data movement:** Training large models involves moving large volumes of data between storage, compute, between datacenters, etc. Inference also has latency requirements, so networking bandwidth, latency, storage speed matter.
* **Supply chain and manufacturing:** Everything needs to be manufactured at scale. Also packaging, testing, transport.
* **Software, orchestration, tools:** Software stack to manage hardware: scheduling of training/inference, utilization, monitoring, fault tolerance, optimizing for power, usage, etc. Also tools for model evaluation & selection, efficiency, etc.
* **Regulation, environment, sustainability:** Ensuring that scaling doesn’t blow up carbon emissions, water usage; environmental permitting; policy around energy usage; ensuring power grid stability; social/environmental impact of building huge facilities.

For high earners, will the Roth limit increase beyond the $8,600 for year 2026 for those 50yo+? For example, 50yo with earnings below $150,000 will have a Roth max of $8,600 (standard $7,500 + catchup $1,100), but higher earners will have a higher limit, because catchup contributions that were previously pretax get added? Or will the catchup amount still be just $1,100?  Looks like I'll have $11,500 less in pretax 403(b) contributions.

I’ve been following ACHR for almost a year, but I haven’t added more shares recently because the stock seems a bit volatile despite all the developments.

I’ve done a lot of DD on them and I like their tech and long term vision, but some circumstances have changed over the past few months that make me cautious.

They’re making moves into the defense and military space, with partnerships like Anduril, trademarks like Monarch, Giraffa, and Mothra & property acquisitions near defense partners. They’re also set for upcoming events like the Dubai AirShow and potential operations in Abu Dhabi. These moves could create serious upside if executed well

https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/archer-aviation-inc-achr-a-bull-case-theory-4-1606309/

The main issues are that they’ve missed earnings ($0.36 loss vs expected $0.24), and insiders have been selling significant shares recently. That always raises a red flag, even if it’s not a dealbreaker.

The stock’s trajectory is still promising, but progress has been slower than some expected. Their tech is solid, and the military angle could be a game-changer, but execution risk is real and timelines aren’t guaranteed.

SP has now reached levels where some long-term investors might start considering adding again, but I’m still on the sidelines.

1nufyxd,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 11:17:11,"Honeywell, spin off, next General Electric? Opportunity? Division into 3 new companies: Materials, Automation and Aviation.","In 2021, General Electric decided to dismantle its historic conglomerate by dividing it into three autonomous companies: GE Aerospace, GE Vernova and GE HealthCare.

The overall capitalization of the three companies rose to around 474 billion dollars, compared to 290 billion before the split. In other words, the market recognized over 180 billion in additional value thanks to the separation.

Why does this happen? There are three main reasons. First: conglomerates often suffer from a market ""discount"", because investors struggle to give the right value to very different businesses. By separating them, each company becomes more readable and comparable to direct competitors. Second: capital management improves, because each entity can invest without having to compromise with the needs of other divisions. Third: a dedicated board of directors and management can move with greater clarity and accountability.

Let's talk about Honeywell. Today the company is organized into four major areas: Aerospace, Safety and Productivity Solutions, Building Technologies and Energy and Sustainability. Translated into a post-spinoff scenario, we could imagine three companies: Honeywell Aerospace, Honeywell Automation (which would combine the first two non-aerospace divisions), and Solstice Advanced Materials, focused on specialty chemistry and decarbonization technologies.

The shareholder letter decided to give 1 share of solstice for each share of Honeywell. The split of the other 2 divisions is expected at the end of 2026.

The Aerospace segment is by far the strongest and represents the main source of revenue. Honeywell supplies avionics, engines and auxiliary systems to giants such as Boeing and Airbus, but also to military aircraft and even future eVTOLs such as those from Joby Aviation. In addition to this, a significant portion comes from after-sales services: maintenance, repairs and overhauls which guarantee recurring flows.

Honeywell Automation, on the other hand, would focus on industrial automation, intelligent warehouses and security solutions. Think of scanners, robotics and voice-picking systems in Amazon warehouses, gas detectors and PPE for industrial workers, or energy and fire management systems for complex buildings such as airports and university campuses.

Finally, Solstice Advanced Materials would represent the “greener” and more futuristic side: CO₂ capture, green hydrogen, advanced battery materials and sustainable chemical solutions. A reality in its own right, with a positioning perfectly in line with the ESG priorities of global investors.

For an investor there are three paths. The first is to buy Honeywell shares now and wait for the split, then deciding whether to keep all the companies or sell the less interesting ones. The second is to wait for the spin-off and bet directly on the most promising horse, which in all likelihood will be Aerospace.

2) ​The concentration of capital is extreme. The ten largest funds are capturing around 43% of total commitments, while overall fundraising is tracking toward an eight-year low.

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley’s are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley’s. When economic conditions are rough, there’s not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn’t be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been heavily declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is “motorcycles are dangerous”. Anyone who rides motorcycles, knows someone who has been injured or killed on a bike. It is not very uncommon in the community.

6. The overall state of the market makes me nervous. Everything’s great until it isn’t and I want to have a hedge against a potential downturn in the market. I think this company would be more heavily affected than anything else I could choose from.

After finally saving money and having some free cash to invest (10k) this march(2025), I put it in the market. I started with regular stocks and then went into options.

I recently found more inner peace by focusing on stuff that actually matters. Been going to the gym and spending more time outside and with people.

Brazil apparently also has something similar called Pix 

Apparently there's more similar systems popping up in many countries, both utilizing Central banks and operating via QR codes, independent of the american visa/mastercard payment networks, not only are they simple to use, they are purely digital and convenient. 

The most important evidence of their value though is the fact that Murica has attacked both systems, calling[ Qris a 'trade barrier](https://windonesia.com/article/us-cites-qris-as-trade-barrier-but-us-payment-model-unfit-for-indonesia)' or[ Pix 'unfair to Murican companies'](https://paymentexpert.com/2025/07/22/us-investigation-brazil-pix-payment-system/)

This to me signals that those systems are an active threat since after all, them taking over the market means American payment processors like Visa and mastercard will be losing a lot of power and relevance. And people are also politically motivated to find alternatives due to all the censorship those payment networks are pushing for.

This directly triggered a sharp drop in lithium prices, causing global lithium miners’ share prices to plunge.  
Australia’s mining sector lost approximately **AUD 8.4 billion in market value in one day**.  
Several major lithium mining stocks **fell by more than 10%**.

Investors are concerned that lithium prices will remain under long-term pressure, compressing profit margins across the industry.

Over the past two years, lithium has been known as **“white oil”**, with tight supply and surging prices.  
Now, additional supply from giants like CATL is expected to **break the fragile supply-demand balance**.

If a price war begins, **small mining companies and high-cost producers** may be hit first.

In the short term, the lithium sector is likely to face **valuation corrections** and **downward revisions in earnings expectations**.

It was priced monthly, so presumably marketable. It had a 10-12% yield, which was fairly typical for bond funds at the time. But the income was never reported on her her tax forms; however, it did show up as a ""RECIP DIST"" on the 1099s with a note, ""Your distributions have been adjusted to reflect proper tax reportability."" She had her taxes prepared by a CPA so presumably he knew what he was doing.

The NAV of the fund steadily declined over the 7 years she held it. I don't think the dividend was 100% return of capital. (What would be the point anyway of buying a fund that paid back mostly return of capital, unless it was some kind of tax oddity?)

If BLS data were questioned, investors and policymakers would have difficulty accurately assessing the economy. Misleading metrics could cause fiscal and monetary policy to deviate from actual needs.

If the Fed were perceived as losing independence -for example, under political pressure - interest rate policy, inflation targeting, and bond market stability could all be affected. Markets might price in higher risk premiums, volatility could rise, and long-term planning would become more uncertain.

If such a scenario plays out, the market implications could be huge especially for energy.

Oil & Gas: Russia remains a major supplier globally despite sanctions. A credible peace push could ease fears of supply disruptions and potentially bring more Russian crude/natural gas back into legitimate global channels. On the flip side, if escalation happens before talks, we could see another spike in Brent/WTI.

Europe: European natural gas prices have been extremely sensitive to the war. A genuine move toward peace could stabilize or even depress prices, but if the path is rocky, volatility might remain high. LNG exporters in the U.S. (LNG, CQP) could be impacted if Europe shifts away from emergency buying.

Energy Stocks: Majors like XOM, CVX, Shell, BP might see headwinds if peace reduces the risk premium baked into energy markets. On the other hand, stability could boost refining margins and long-term demand planning.

Broader Commodities: If peace looks real, agricultural and fertilizer markets might calm (Ukraine/Russia being key wheat & potash exporters).

1nmnmh3,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 05:34:11,"Late cycle consumer spending shift = downside CMG, SG, etc?","
TL;DR: bearish Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen. Looking for suggestions on similar situations. The devaluation of fast casuals, lululemon feels like a symptom of shifting culture and consumer behaviour. Inflation, portion size shrinking, declining economic activity, consumer fatigue, non existent brand loyalty, and limited scope to rebrand, reinvent, optimize. Late-cycle cultural and consumer-spending shift, where former aspirational brands (fast casual, athleisure, boutique fitness, “accessible luxury”) have gone from status signifiers to punchlines.

Six years ago I visited a Lululemon store for the first time having been familiar with the brand for many years. I knew the brand as a high quality expensive semi boutique level product associated with Soul Cycle, Equinox etc. The store gave a different impression. Some of the clothes were wrinkled and badly presented, customer service was non existent, and they seemed to have no inventory. I assumed it was a one off bad example. But over the following six years I saw the same symptoms again and again and again. Meanwhile, other clues appeared: bigger and bigger sales discounts; diversification into non-sports products with no cohesive direction; a noticeable drop in quality of some garments (I’ve received a few Lululemon gifts down the years). Competitors with cheaper, equally good quality gear eating their market share. 


When I read about $LULU’s demise, I thought “oh course!” (hindsight’s easy, huh?) and began thinking who’s next? While already down bad this year, I can’t help shake the feeling Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen have much more downside risk. The traction gained by the “slop bowl” meme to describe their offerings feels like the Chipotle’s Mr Big dying on a Peloton bike moment. An increasing number of comedians joke about slop bowls and the term “slop bowl” has spiked to four times its previous highs on Google search trends this week. It sounds trivial, but this pervasive content influences our tastes, prompts us to take a look in the mirror at stuff we do on autopilot. I think small rallies / dead cat bounce short covering strength just offer nice entry position opportunities to get short.

With inflation rising sharply, portion sizes shrinking, declining quality of ingredients being masked with higher and higher salt content, these brands need to reinvent in other directions. Trouble is, I don’t know where they can turn. I don’t trust they do either. 

The 2010-19 period brought Netflix, Spotify, fast casual lunch spots with “healthy options” and “fresh ingredients”, it brought Equinox and Soul Cycle and F45 and Amex Platinum lounges to create the illusion for aspirational young professionals that they’ve made it to the top. That illusion is being dismantled. Costs are spiralling, fees are rising, and all these brands and business models feel tired and dare I say a bit embarrassing? These brands were once exciting and pleasing. Aspirational. Now, they feel tired and clichéd. Their complacency isn’t deserving of our money and I think they are heavily exposed to a new wave of disruptors over the coming years.

The 2010-19 era saw consumer spending shift away from luxury goods, cars, Electronics and refocus on travel, food, lifestyle. With more Americans owning passports than ever before and travelling to Europe in record numbers, it might sound silly to claim we’re at a turning point from experience-centric consumer spending, but I truly think we’ve reached saturation point in this cultural cycle. I suspect we’re seeing the beginning of the end of this cycle with no clear path to what the next looks like. 

One thing’s for sure: queueing up every day to buy $20 cardboard bowl of rice, cheese, soggy chicken, greens, some kind of flavored salty liquid labelled as dressing is an undignified experience we will come to laugh at in years to come.",18,6,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nmnmh3/late_cycle_consumer_spending_shift_downside_cmg/,month,Unknown,0.74

Where do I go? I don't know this world of investing. Albeit, I know the world of trading very well, and why I and others mostly fail at it miserably.

Oklo announced today that the NRC has accepted for review their Principal Design Criteria (PDC) report under an accelerated timeline. The PDC report usually defines the safety, reliability and performance requirements that will underpin future reactor licensing and design efforts. Because it’s accepted early and ahead of schedule, once approved it can be referenced in future applications- meaning that Oklo won’t have to re-defend those criteria each time, which streamlines licensing and speeds deployment.

They also noted that the NRC accepted the report in just 15 days (versus the typical 30-60 days), and **the NRC expects to issue is draft evaluation by early 2026- about half the usual review time**. Legislation and regulatory modernization efforts are cited as supporting for accelerated licensing pathways.",15,1,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nudkn6/oklos_nrc_principal_design_report_accepted_for/,month,Unknown,0.79

*Oklo Inc today holds a groundbreaking ceremony at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for its first Aurora powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”*

*“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.*

*The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.*

*“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”*",18,1,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1no05ld/oklo_breaks_ground_on_first_aurora_powerhouse/,month,Unknown,0.74

1nhy2zb,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 17:02:24,Arguments for and against international diversification,"I am currently in the process of reweighting and simplifying my portfolio. Around 85% of my holdings are in the USA, with 15% in developed international.

As of late, I have been considering reweighting this and potentially adding in emerging market exposure.

The US has outperformed international for some time now. I can see some reasons to believe that American Exceptionalism could continue.

1. Many American brands have a very high prestige around the world and can eat into international market share
2. Some American companies have a technological edge which will attract business from around the globe
3. The US has a very business-friendly climate and regulatory structure.
4. I see storm clouds on the horizon for many developed international markets, namely the birth rate crisis, sovereign debt issues, and business-hostile climate. Emerging markets similarly have their own problems, namely political risk, and environmental/climate issues.

However I can also see some basic arguments in favor of diversification:

1. Sure the US has outperformed in recent memory but that may be all the more reason for international stocks with more reasonable P/E ratios to outperform, moving forward.
2. The de-dollarization process has begun. [Foreign central banks now hold more Gold reserves than Treasuries for the first time in 30 years](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzrOr3jXEAA7pGm?format=jpg&name=medium) and the USA more generally is exhibiting signs of emerging market behavior. Rising populism from both parties, the erosion of Federal Reserve independence, a new push for more direct federal government management of the economy (tariffs, Intel, etc.), and the potential of monetizing the national debt all introduce a new set of risks and challenges for the US market.
3. Even with immigration, the US is not immune to the demographic problems plaguing the rest of the developed world. US deaths are expected to outpace births by 2031. Emerging markets have growing populations who are becoming educated and plugged into the internet at a breakneck pace.

1nnfyrl,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 03:24:22,Why EnSilica is Worth Possibly 13x its Current Price (Updated),"Okay, so you are probably thinking… yeah right, here’s that degenerate Double Bubbler banging on about that penny stock again. Well take a brief moment and read the following to see why my opinion is not so outlandish. You may one day thank me for it.

EnSilica develops custom semiconductor chips called ASICs. Essentially dedicated silicon expertly designed to a particular task such as providing encryption for Internet of Things devices, or efficiently moving data across satellite networks as will hopefully soon be the case with their custom ASIC for AST Space Mobile.

Recently MDA Space acquired a relatively low profile Israeli firm Satixfy for $280m in an all cash offer. Satixfy being a competitor to EnSilica in the ASIC marketplace and high growth satellite communications industry, with 2024 revenue of $20.6m. So that acquisition price is over 13x last year’s revenue!

Compare that with EnSilica’s forecast FY25 revenue (to be confirmed in results anticipated next month) of approximately $25m to $27m as well as a forecast FY26 revenue of between $44m and $47m with ‘80% of FY 2026 revenue already covered by existing customer contracts’ according to EnSilica’s trading update on the London Stock Exchange in April. *Please note I have used the current FX rate to convert figures that were originally quoted by EnSilica in GBP.*

Consider also that another competitor of EnSilica’s is Filtronic who have significant contracts with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Given the importance of Filtronic’s ASICs to SpaceX it has formed a strategic alliance with the firm and acquired 10,949,079 warrants - 5% of the current share capital of Filtronic - which would give SpaceX the opportunity to acquire a notable stake in the firm. Why would it want that? Well in my opinion to ensure they could have a say in the future direction of the firm as well as perhaps giving them the opportunity to create a defensive position to fend off hostile takeovers of Filtronic.

On the subject of Filtronic it is worth considering their forward price-to-sales ratio compared to EnSilica’s. EnSilica trades at a forward PS of just over 1.12 (against the low end of their current FY26 forecast) which compares to Filtronic‘s forward PS of 5.3 according to Simply Wall St data. If EnSilica achieves a similar forward PS as it approaches it’s anticipated medium term sales projection of c.£100 per year (hopefully together with a healthy profit margin) then you could see a market capitalisation of £500m+. That’s 13.44 times the current share price.

Who do I think are likely contenders to acquire EnSilica? Well Qualcomm could be a prime candidate in my opinion. Or another large and diversified semiconductor manufacturer that appreciates and can take advantage of the breadth of EnSilica’s IP, not just the sat comm work but including the post quantum encryption chip, optical networking design IP and automotive radar IP which is being developed in tandem with Radareye following funding from a consortium including Transport for London, IAG and Admiral.

Another possibility is AST Space Mobile, who EnSilica signed a contract with for a high value satellite ASIC in 2021 and which I understand will be a core component within AST’s BlueBird Block 2 satellite constellation scheduled for launch in the coming year or so. I consider AST a possibility as I wouldn’t be surprised that over time they broaden their offering to more fully compete with SpaceX’s Starlink (e.g. higher bandwidth satellite comms with guaranteed quality of service via terminal devices for static and mobile situations). EnSilica has a suite of IP for satellite terminals (a market which is worth billions of dollars) and owning that IP could help AST better compete with Starlink in that scenario.

I can also see U.S. and European companies such as Boeing, Airbus or Thales taking interest, especially given plans for the European Union’s forthcoming IRIS2 constellation. EnSilica’s IP and talent would seemingly be of great benefit to various industry titans in the satellite communications race that is heating up rapidly.

While I would like to see EnSilica grow to become a future British tech champion, I could understand the management accepting an offer of approximately 13x FY26 revenue. With a notable holding myself, I would not complain either.

While EnSilica’s share price fell last week, I still have immense conviction in this promising company and my recent discussion with Chairman Mark Hodgkins has only given me additional confidence in its future long term potential.

Yes, the share price may be turbulent in the times ahead however I may accumulate further should weakness persist (as I did last week) or following what I feel is an unlikely near term event, a rights issue, as is rumoured on ADVFN for example. 

EnSilica is a company I intend to hold for the years ahead given their apparent trajectory as well as potential for being acquired at a significant multiple to its current value.

1npm4f4,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 15:50:49,Is Celestica (CLS) the quiet “picks & shovels” winner of the AI build-out?,"Seven weeks ago Celestica (CLS) hit the $253 price target I’d set. Since then, the stock has kept climbing, and, more importantly, the fundamentals have strengthened. This isn’t just another contract manufacturer anymore; it’s becoming one of the key suppliers enabling the AI infrastructure boom.



The CCS segment grew 28% y/y in Q2 2025. Its HPS revenue surged 82% y/y, lifting margins and returns. These numbers are being driven by the transition from 400G to 800G network switches, the high-speed plumbing that connects massive GPU clusters. Every major hyperscaler is now ramping 800G programs, and Celestica already has design wins for 1.6T switching racks scheduled to start in 2026.



You can add more GPUs to a cluster, but if the links between them are slow, training times don’t improve. Doubling network speed from 400G to 800G (and soon 1.6T) removes that bottleneck. Celestica spotted this shift early and is now one of the go-to suppliers for ultra-fast switches and racks.



The macro backdrop is also reinforcing the thesis. Nvidia and OpenAI just announced a plan to deploy 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA AI systems for OpenAI’s next-generation infrastructure and Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI to make it happen. Oracle has committed a staggering $300 billion to host OpenAI’s future workloads. All of that AI compute has to live somewhere, connected by somebody’s hardware. Celestica sits in the middle of that supply chain, quietly making the high-speed gear that keeps the AI arms race running.



I’ve raised my fair value estimate for Celestica to $320 per share, up from $253. That’s based on higher CCS growth assumptions (35% instead of 27% in 2025) and a slightly lower cost of capital as visibility and margins improve. The upside comes with risks (concentrated customers and potential capex pauses) but the long-term compounding story is intact.",12,8,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npm4f4/is_celestica_cls_the_quiet_picks_shovels_winner/,month,Unknown,0.66

1nbwzid,2025-09-08,2025-09-08 15:15:57,Same funds for 401K and Roth IRA?,"I have a 401k through my job with John Hancock and a Roth IRA with Robinhood. The 401k has limited index fund options, should I try to duplicate my holding in my Roth using etfs, or should I take advantage of the more diverse offerings available on Robinhood and treat it as its own separate portion of my overall portfolio?

So far my Roth is worth about half as much as my 401k. 

My 401k allocation is:

70% VIGAX 

10% VVIAX 

10% VTIAX 

4% JECIX 

3% VSIAX 

3% VSGAX 

I'm considering DCAing into Gold (IAUM) with my Roth as a hedge against inflation, and I have a gut feeling that gold is gonna continue to run up for the next few years. 

Do most people just have the same holdings across multiple accounts or do yall hold different stuff in each one?

Thanks in advance.

Hello! Nonfiction librarian here. This book was purchased via a grant program, and as such would typically be added to the collection. But is it still relevant?

This was published in 2006 and most books this old, especially on this subject, would not be retained––most weeding standards would consider books published in the last 3 years or older as ""old."" I ask mostly because this seems to be the most recent edition.

1nejleo,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 16:25:59,Thoughts on ANGX (Angel Studios) as a Long-Term Play?,"As a few of you know, angel Studios, a streaming company went live on the stock market today.

I’ve been digging into ANGX (Angel Studios) now that it’s newly public, and I’m curious what others think about this one in its early days.

A few things caught my attention:

In less than a year, Angel Studios grew its Guild membership from 600,000 to 1.5 million.

That kind of subscriber growth feels exponential and, in some ways, comparable to Netflix in its early expansion phase.

The company already has a proven track record of producing surprise hits (e.g. Sound of Freedom, homestead and others), and if they can keep scaling content and membership, the upside could be massive.

I’m not saying this is a guaranteed rocket ship. nothing is, but if Angel continues on this trajectory, it could be a 10× in the next decade or two. Some even think it could become one of those rare 100× companies, but obviously that’s speculation.

Right now, I’m mainly shooting for the 10× potential and want to hear what others think:

Do you see ANGX as a serious long-term hold?

Is anyone else planning to buy in or build a position and just let it ride for years?

Or do you think the hype fades and the business model isn’t sustainable at scale?

Would love to hear different takes especially from those who invest in high-growth, early-stage public companies.",12,33,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nejleo/thoughts_on_angx_angel_studios_as_a_longterm_play/,month,Unknown,0.81

Their GDP numbers look way better than most developed countries, and some of their tech companies are scaling crazy fast. The thing is, I honestly have no clue how accessible (or safe) this stuff is for a regular retail investor outside those regions.

Has anyone here actually put a small allocation into these developing markets? If so, did you use ETFs, ADRs, or some other route? Just wondering if now is the right time to diversify a little bit, or if the risks (political/regulatory/currency) outweigh the potential upside.

P.S. if your suggestion is yes I can try, then I might start with just a little amount first.

1nclqt0,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 11:18:12,Volatility: Is it a risk?,"Hello everyone,

  
My investment journey started one year ago. One of the major pillars I had in my mind was that I would not go fully in the markets until I understand what I was about to do. So, I started to read in the Internet, read some books and papers, listen to some podcasts .. It has been an enrichment experience!  
For sure that I don't dominate the area and most of the times I need a confirmation from someone, like ChatGPT or reddit users :)

Soooo, question of the day: does volatility and drawdowns represent risk? My view:  
1) Yes, on a psicological and behaviour perspective. People panic and try to minimize their losses, get out and return to the market later, etc.  
2) No, if you are literate in the topic and absorbed the right ideas. Volatility is nothing, just temporary oscillations that in fact represent opportunities to buy dips.

I have been a bit skeptical about my current portfolio, as I naturally prefer to keep it simple and avoid risky stuff. I started with 100% FTSE All World ETF, and I recently added 15% World Small Cap Value and 15% World Momentum.  
I am not going to lie, but it goes a bit against my initial view of risk avoidence profile and I considered to go back to the initial portfolio or to add some other factors, like Quality and Minimum Volatility ETFs. Well, it happens that now I don't care about volatility.  
  
Just to complete and finish my strategy, I intend to monthly DCA in the underweight ETF in order to keep the right % allocation. I considered also to rebalancing my selling a small % of outperformed ETF and reallocate to another, but it might not be fiscally efficient.  
Before 10years of retirement, I will add short bonds and start to weight it through time.

1nfwv0f,2025-09-13,2025-09-13 08:58:13,Your sustainable fund might not be what you think it is,"A massive academic review of sustainable investing research uncovered something concerning: recent studies show many funds labeled as ""sustainable"" or ""ESG"" actually contain companies with significant ESG controversies.

The research analyzed nearly 1,000 papers spanning 35 years and found that while sustainable investing exploded after 2015, the methods for screening companies remain surprisingly primitive. Most research relies on backward-looking data rather than predictive analysis, and there's virtually no use of modern technology to detect or prevent greenwashing.

This matters for individual investors because you might think you're investing ethically while inadvertently funding practices you oppose. The fund labels and ESG ratings we rely on appear to have significant blind spots.

The study suggests we're in the early stages of sustainable investing - like the dial-up era of ESG. The infrastructure for truly effective sustainable screening is still being built.

If you're investing in ESG funds, this research suggests doing additional due diligence beyond just trusting the label or rating. The field is evolving rapidly, but current methods may not be as reliable as they appear.

1nqrymi,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 00:24:21,"Is my explanation of how bonds work, correct?","Thank you very much for your help. Very much appreciated!



**How do bonds work?**  
Put as simply as I could:

1. Government/firm issues a bond with a coupon rate (interest rate) similar to the market interest rate.
2. **Primary market:** according to RBA (*2022),* when an investor has purchased the bond **for the first time,** this is called buying in the **primary** **market**. *(This first price of bond depends on interest rate, term of bond, and price of similar bonds).*
3. **In the primary market, the buyer pays the face (nominal) value of the bond, and the yield (aka return) matches the bonds coupon rate.** The buyer will want the coupon rate/yield to be higher than market interest rates.
4. But if later on the bondholder decides to sell the bond before maturity, (due to many factors) it will be sold on the '“**secondary market.”**
5. **In the secondary market -** bond market price fluctuates on top of the face value because of supply and demand. There are many factors affecting bond like competing market interest rates (shown below) and the yield of the bond. Makes sense, right? When market prices exceed the face value of a bond, you are paying at a premium. When market prices are below face value of a bond, you are paying at a discount
6. Bondholders will need to recalculate the yield, as the coupon rate no longer matches the yield (because market prices have changed). This is done using this simple formula: coupon / market price x 100 **The relationship between the market price and bond yield is inverse.** *(EconplusDal, 2017)*",9,9,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqrymi/is_my_explanation_of_how_bonds_work_correct/,month,Unknown,0.85

Do you guys think its worth the $2600 premium to continue to contribute to the HSA?   Or should I take the   premium and the post-tax HSA money and drop it in a Roth or something else?

India's regulators just opened up REITs to retail investors and they're getting included in equity indices. This feels like one of those regulatory changes that could actually move the needle.

Context: REITs were mostly institutional before, now everyday investors can get in easier. Plus the equity index inclusion should improve liquidity significantly.

I'm curious about the timing - this comes right as we're seeing institutional money flow into affordable housing elsewhere (Brookfield's $10B+ manufactured housing deal in the U.S., for example).

Anyone with experience in emerging market REITs? Regulatory changes like this usually precede bigger investment waves, but India's property market has its own unique dynamics.

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I’m doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I’ve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I’ve never had much of a strategy, I’ve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I’ve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in “core” growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in “moonshots” like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. 

The issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max. 

I struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I’m up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there. 

At the same time, it’s becoming almost impossible to manage 33 stocks at once effectively.

I started investing 5 years ago. Im from hungary, so we have very good yield on government bonds. 6,5% for 3 years bond (this is for citizens only, not institutions).

I have a stock portfolio, which is performing very well. But I dont have an intention to increase it at the time.

Instead with my spare money I started flat flipping, my return on a flip is between 10 and 30% but realistically it will decrease to 10-12% net a year (market is changing).

My question is: what is your oppinion, it is worth to continue flipping for a 10-12% net percentage, or should I put in on bonds, the yield difference is only 3,5-5,5%. Which I know is significant, but bond require no work, flat flipping requires 20 hours a month.

So what so you think, the 3,5-5,5% is worth the 20 hours and headaches, or should I put this time to focus on other things, and just sit on bonds?

IT & industrials
Even if AI will eventually flop, it's still going. However, with Mag7 valuations and EPS projections being far from perfect, I prefer looking at those who sell timber and iron to the shovel makers: COMM, STRL etc. 

Aerospace&Defense look really good considering ongoing conflicts and lack of tariff exposure.

Great sectors overall, but picking is a key. 

Comms
They are beating expectations harder what tech. Some great regional diversification, too, with VEON or IHS.


Materials
Despite a bull market, gold skyrocketed. Most of gold diggers though are still priced like an ounce is worth $2k, despite their margins are wide af. And with growing inflation, crappy bond yields, and high uncertainty, it's hard to imagine what could go wrong for gold. It's literally almost impossible to pick a bad stock there, an average gold stock has made 70% over a year. 


Financials
Banks should benefit from the falling interest rates. BNPL should benefit from this and reducing in consumer buying power. 


Energy
Nuclear is overbought, and oil seems to be on the downward trend, nothing to fish here. 


Consumer Staples
Not a bad choice with purchase power dropping. I really like CALM, for instance


Consumer Discretionary
Not sure I get a point why invest into them. Tech/Comms/Industrials will do better in a bull market, and this sector will be hurt just as much in the bear market. 


Utilities
Kinda same as with energy, I don't see green to be taking cash. I do like SBS though. Maybe hidden tech stocks like VTOL


Healthcare
I don't believe in biotech at large, but some pragmatic things like hospitals or telemedicine could be great


REIT
Nah, not with BBB :)

1nm58pv,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 14:09:53,Opening Discussion About RDDT,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.

Back in the late 90s/early 2000s, there was active following on Investor Village on the Rambus thread with handles like Watzman, CroakerFrog, ScruffyNYC, and many others.  After Intel designated RDRAM the sole memory for their new Pentium chip, Rambus skyrocketed and briefly traded above 100 in early 2000.  However, RDRAM was poorly received by both consumers and memory makers due to cost and some technical issues and resistance from the memory makers.

After a series of legal setbacks, failing to win infringement claims, losing an anti-trust lawsuit, and having to face a politically motivated FTC investigation, the stock price crashed and traded in the single digits.

It's been a long, slow recovery.  I think it's safe to say that most investors from that time eventually gave up on the thought that the share price would ever reach 100 again.

It’s all cashiers checks that she refuses to cash and deposit into the bank. Might be something left over from a divorce way back or bankruptcy. Either way, I’ve tried telling her that she’s lost nearly 10% of her cashes spending value this year alone. Invest in SOMETHING at least. She says, “ I need a place to live but I can’t afford one”. Boy will she be shocked when prices rise again and stay elevated… With the rate cuts current and planned, I can foresee even more sticky inflation in our futures. That being said, I’m a casual investor with only my limited experience these past 10yrs. 
My questions are as follows:

1- How do I effectively simplify and explain these current events and how they affect her and her savings. Now and in the future.

2-What is the general consensus on a relatively safe investment with liquidity in approx 2-5yrs? Normally in this situation with her age I wouldn’t recommend stocks. Too volatile even the “safer” bets to guarantee her investments safety in a time frame she could access it. Shoot I’m young enough I’d be riding this thing out but she’s not. Then there’s silver and gold. Both at almost all time highs. That was my first knee jerk reaction but again. Would hate to have her invest in a top of which I couldn’t help her with. Still, with inflationary pressures I think for it’s mobility and stability I think she should stack gold. If she’s not going to invest it through normal channels. 

My family historically hasn’t been the best with money/investments. Best bet would to find a good financial advisor but see previous sentence…I just worry that her fear of making a move will hurt her more than actually doing something to combat this.

I’ve been looking into silver recently as a potential investment, and I’m curious what the community thinks.

On one hand, it seems like silver has some solid fundamentals:

* It’s both a precious metal and an industrial metal (used in electronics, solar panels, medical tech, etc.).
* Historically, it’s seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.
* Compared to gold, it looks relatively undervalued right now.

On the other hand:

* Silver can be extremely volatile, sometimes even more than gold.
* Industrial demand could fluctuate depending on the economy.
* It doesn’t provide dividends or yield, so holding it is a pure bet on price appreciation.

I’ve been pretty skeptical about Oracle’s surge, but they are about to recognize a lot of revenues. This market reaction is interesting because so far, the “big AI” bets were companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, Google, Meta, Broadcom, etc. Oracle, by contrast, has long been seen as more of a legacy play, focused on infrastructure for large enterprises.

What we’re seeing is that investors still go crazy for AI, especially when an established, “old guard” player gets involved. Is this an overreaction? Hard to say. Ideally, markets should value not just AI mentions and vision, but the actual value being unlocked. Maybe that’s exactly what’s being priced in here or maybe it’s an over- or underreaction, since we still don’t fully understand what AI will ultimately deliver.

I noticed that many people don't know a lot of financial concepts, not just investing concepts. It is fair that you do not need to know much finance to invest, but sometimes I come across surprises on how much money is being invested without truly understanding the ways around it. Of course, it is good to start investing, and I would also rather just start with minimal knowledge and pick up the rest on the way. 

Nevertheless, what are the concepts that you would like to learn more about? (Also, if you could specify for how long you are investing now and/or your background for context would help a lot!)

This kind of environment often boosts risk appetite and pushes equities higher in the short run.

However, key concerns remain:

* Questions around the sustainability of corporate earnings growth.
* Diverging macro data, with some leading indicators pointing to downside risks.
* Uncertainty around the path of interest rates and inflation.

In short, markets are caught between sentiment and fundamentals. Denial and liquidity may continue to drive gains in the near term, but if fundamentals fail to deliver, volatility could return.

1ny8yig,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 19:32:37,Do stock valuation metrics matter?,"Hi, I'm new to investment from EU.

I recently learned about stock valuation measures such as P/B, P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and more. However, I started to feel like these traditional stock valuation metrics do not really provide useful insights in fast-growing companies nowadays and which one to invest. For instance, the current stock price valuations on tech companies such as Tesla, Palantir, Nebius, AST Space, and IonQ are not justified by the metrics IMO. It seems like to me that the majority of the tech companies have very high premium price solely judged by the valuation metrics. Perhaps, it's just all about the AI, EV, and future technology hype, but their stock prices have been growing fast long enough even though people pointed out they are overvalued years ago. I don't think that professional investors are dumber than some random dudes using yahoo finance or seeking alpha and ignore all those numbers...  

As I see, qualitative properties (e.g, market trend, product outlook) have much stronger influence on the stock price. I'm not sure if I should be less concerned about the metrics and be more focused on what company does and the current market trend.

**1. Fake analyst ratings**  
  
Quantum Companies like **Quantum Computing Inc** (**QUBT**) have recently gotten a new promotional analyst rating from ""**Ascendiant Capital**"", raising their target from **22 usd** to **40 usd**. Now I know that these fake analyst ratings are normal within small-cap companies but once companies enter the 1 billion+ market cap, don't these companies automatically become subject to all the **SEC** rules and therefore this could be considered fraud even though **Ascendiant** discloses that it was a paid analyst rating? I'm not too sure on this but I asked ChatGPT and it said yes, and it gave me a wild theory, that they do this because of the government shutdown and the fact that 90% of the **SEC** is off on leave. (idk if this is true, but sounds absolutely insane and just maybe insane enough to be true). This conversely sent the stock flying and generated headlines on both Yahoo finance and tradingview.

**2. Dilution and Liquidity**  
  
2 weeks ago (15-18th of september) the vice president of **QUBT** sold off **100%** or **400.000** of his shares. October 1st **QUBT** diluted further 25m shares into the pool, and even though the market should have been bearish it ended up sending the stock flying up 25% in the first 30 mins of trading because of a short squeeze (i think).

Everyone knows they're a scam, they pivoted from beverages to quantum and now sell vaporware. They already have several SEC filings against them and one for fraud would be detrimental. Could this rally just be in order to make sure there's sufficient liquidity for a cashout, now that their market cap is 4b+?

I'll give some quick context before, but if you're not interested you can skip to the bottom part! :) 

I am currently 19 years old and am trying to get into investing. I had a rough period but recently I learned to live life a bit healthier etc and also to manage my money a lot better. I still study, but work on the side every now and then as well, which gives me a small, but stable income. I'm planning on investing €200/month, with a self created trading plan. To start it off, I will be transfering all the money I have put in crypto's as well. (rn its about €1.8k, with 80% of profits, i put in €1k) so in short: DCA ing €200/month with a starting of almost €2k. 

I will be trying to get a portfolio for the very long term as I am still young, with relatively secure, small profits yearly, looking for like 5-10% a year on average (tell me if that's too ambitious pls). I have three questions however. 

TL;DR

1) I live in Belgium. Does anyone have suggestions for which trading platform I should use? I've been looking into trade republic, degiro, bux and interactive brokers. Right now I don't really know which one suits my plan better. any suggestions are welcome

2) My current Idea isn't extremely concrete yet, but at least its something :)   
\- 65% ETFs with 40% of worldwide ETF's, 10% emerging markets, 10% tech and 5% clean energy  
\- 20% Obligations  
\- 10% REIT (if possible with the brokers)  
\- 5% cash/gold   
Any feedback on this? better ideas or things you want to tell me? Goal is to get about an average of 5-10% profit yearly, accumulating 

3) Is it a good idea to start investing with my plan in about 2 weeks, or should I wait? I feel like the markets have been doing very well lately and I would hate to get in at the ATH's and see everything going down when the AI bubble pops. I've been reading a lot about it and I see what people mean by saying that.

1nxpsq3,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 05:49:03,Is the Al Lending Boom Innovation or a Hidden Bubble?,"From what I know, I think the surge of capital into Al-enabled fintech, which led global funding to hit $100B in Q3 is less about consumer-facing genius and more about enterprise solutions fixing massive systemic problems, but this focus introduces a major hidden risk.

The facts driving this investment I think is:

1) VCs Target Enterprise: Over 80% of Al-enabled fintech funding goes to enterprise-focused startups because Al is solving complex legacy problems like accounting, data compliance, and risk profiling. Enterprise applications are receiving a majority of VC deal value (around 74.6% in 2025).

2) Al is primarily accelerating credit scoring and risk assessment. This allows fintechs to approve more loans with fewer risks than traditional models, making lending one of the most significant investment sectors.

3) As Al models become ""black boxes"" of complex data, the key challenge shifts to regulatory compliance and liability. If an opaque Al lending model introduces bias or failure, the risk of legal action and capital loss dramatically increases.

The conclusion is clear: the substantial capital inflow is driven by measurable efficiency gains, but it comes with a proportional rise in unseen risk.

I've laid out the data which I had got now I want your pov for the collective read: Is the bigger ""funding pain"" the challenge of accessing these high-value, exclusive enterprise deals, or is it the challenge of vetting the long-term, hidden compliance and liability risk of the Al models themselves?

Let's discuss solutions for adapting to this new diligence standard.

I am hoping I can save at least $500k in stocks before retirement in about 6 years. I will also have about $50000/year pension. If I add my social security benefits, I should be fine. However, I have a special needs child who I want to leave my investment to when I pass so he can live off the annual returns. 
My plan is to travel a lot between retirement time age 60 to age 70 and cut down significantly on expenses at age 70. I am hoping I will not need more than 5% of my return on investment to supplement my income. I will have a good health plan with my pension and will be paying around $1400 mortgage. 

My question is with this plan, can I still leave at least the 500k investment for my special needs son? For those who have retired for a while, which age range is the most expensive during retirement? 

Edit: 
My mortgage will last another 10 years after retirement at 60. No car payments. My monthly expenses is about $5200 inclusive of mortgage payments. I have no debts. My investment is with Robinhood managed by them. (Currently about $ 225000 95% stocks). I also have about $125000 of which 80k is pretax and 45k Roth 403 b with my employer. I am thinking of spending between $10k to $ 20k a year on extensive trips from  age 60 to 70 when I retire and then significantly cut down. I am 54 and currently contribute about 30k between my investments a year. Thanks for any advice or comments.

My gut tells me not to buy all in at this premium but my brain is saying do it. 
Also the Fed reserve keep on saying the ""word"" 
""deteriorating"" which is kind of scary to me
Fed won't usually use the word stagflation publicly because it has heavy negative weight in markets last major U.S stagflation was the 1970s). Instead, they phrase it in softer terms like ""deteriorating"" or ""imbalanced risks
And today AGAIN  Fed's Goolsbee said We are seeing both sides of Fed's mandate ""deteriorate"".

This looks like a stagflation warning in disguise.
That combination stagflation risk (weak growth + sticky inflation
Fed's dual mandate price stability (inflation) and maximum employment.

If both sides are deteriorating, it suggests:
Inflation may not be under control (price stability weakening).

Labor market may be softening (unemployment risk rising)

With all that being said if stagflation hit or if e are already in one iis hard to keep under control and if I invest now it might take years to get best ROI.

1nx78yd,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 14:33:09,What 6 months of automated investing taught me about myself,"Always thought I was a rational investor until I started
tracking my actual behavior. Was checking my portfolio obsessively and making impulsive trades during every market swing.

Decided to try automated strategies as an experiment in removing emotions from investing. Took some research to find platforms I trusted but eventually connected my accounts and stepped back. 6 months later the results speak for themselves. Account is up 23% compared to 9% during the same period last year when I was actively managing everything. Fewer trades but way better timing and execution.

More importantly learned how much mental energy constant portfolio monitoring was consuming. Didn't realize how stressed I was until I stopped checking prices every hour. Work focus improved, relationship with family got better, started exercising regularly again. Biggest surprise was how much better the automated system handled market volatility. During the October selloff I would have panic sold everything. Instead the system kept executing strategies and recovered quickly while I slept peacefully.

Took about a month to break the habit of obsessive checking. Had to delete broker apps from my phone temporarily. Now I review performance maybe twice per week maximum. Still maintaining some individual stock positions for fun but the bulk of serious money is automated now. Scratches the stock picking itch without jeopardizing systematic returns.

The lesson is that removing yourself from daily decisions often leads to better outcomes. Applies beyond just investing too.

This is entirely contained to my fidelity account, where I am building my emergency fund, and have stocks (mostly tech) allocated to shorter term investing - pretty much just extra ""wants"" budget that I want to grow to help for a down payment on a car if I want a nicer one once my current car is done, as well as for buying a cheap car to take to a local track (something I've always wanted to do)

I also am invested in FXAIX. This is the fund I am using for longer term investing, like for putting a down payment on a house (I don't feel entirely committed to my current city even though I love it) in 5 years+.

Anyway I guess my main question is related to my tech stocks.

I have a tech ETF that has returned 30% in the last year ish, up 500 dollars in value.

I also on a whim bought some planet labs stock earlier this year. I put 584 dollars in, and it has gone up 1300 dollars in value total.

Just like when I purchased this stock, I currently still see it as a gamble. I don't know anything about it lmao I just saw on paper that they were doing something well, and landing contracts. And they continued, and their stock continued to go up.

So on one hand I know I can't lose by taking profit, especially that amount, a 200% gain, and that it is risky to stay in on a single company that I know nothing about.

On the other hand, I'm young, and can afford to be risky. Especially since the money invested in that stock was all part of my wants budget in the first place.

Not sure what to do. I'm contributing 840 dollars a month to my fidelity account - total value of 17k, but only 3.5k in my money market position (liquid). I don't regret it yet, but up until like April if this year, I kept buying more stocks, contributing more to FXAIX, the tech ETF, and planet labs. Last time I bought was when the market tanked with the whole tariff thing, which, in hindsight, was a pretty baller move on my end I must say.

But my point is I want to finish my emergency fund first. While I have a really stable job, extra piece of mind doesn't hurt",0,12,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nx0e50/when_do_you_know_to_take_profits/,new,Unknown,0.22

* Netflix stock NFLX fell 2.4% Wednesday, a rare stumble on a day when the S&P 500 notched a record close above 6,700. One thing might be behind the fall – a post from a billionaire.
* Tesla boss Elon Musk echoed boycott calls, writing on X: “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids,” targeting the pro-transgender messaging of the animated series Dead End: Paranormal Park.
* The selloff may not be directly linked to his comments – stocks don’t usually move on culture-war tweets alone – but markets aren’t exactly immune to Musk’s megaphone either.

**Boycott Fears or Just Noise?**

* Investors might be quietly wondering whether this morphs into something bigger.After all, Netflix is no stranger to political or cultural backlash – though historically, it shrugs these off.
* Streaming is sticky. Cancel campaigns have rarely translated into a sustained drop in subscribers, especially given Netflix’s scale and diversified content library.
* Still, even the perception of reputational risk can move a stock in the short term, particularly when traders are hunting for reasons in an otherwise bullish tape.

**Bigger Picture Still Strong**

* Context: Netflix shares are up 32% this year, well ahead of the S&P 500’s 14% gain, proving investors see the platform as resilient in choppy macro conditions.
* Growth levers like ad-supported tiers, password-sharing crackdowns, and global expansion continue to fuel optimism, even if one-off controversies grab headlines.
* Musk’s post may not ding the fundamentals, but it added a twist to a day when Netflix underperformed while the rest of Big Tech marched higher.",0,3,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwvl68/nflx_netflix_stock_sheds_24_was_it_because_of/,new,Unknown,0.41
1nwvgqn,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 06:32:30,FX/crypto investing or speculation?,"Most of my money is in ETFs and individual stocks, which I think of as “real investing.” I try to stick to long-term strategies, diversify, and avoid chasing hype. Lately, though, I’ve been dabbling with a small FX and BTC account, mostly out of curiosity and to experiment with shorter-term trading strategies. The thing is, it feels very different from the stock/ETF world. The speed, the volatility, the way positions can swing in a matter of minutes or hours, it’s almost a completely different mindset.

Because of that, I’ve been wondering: should a small FX or crypto account really count as investing, or is it just pure speculation? On one hand, you’re still putting capital to work, analyzing charts or economic indicators, and managing risk. On the other hand, the risk-reward profile and time horizon feel totally different from traditional investing.

I’m curious how other people approach this. Do you treat FX or crypto accounts as a legitimate part of your portfolio, or is it just a side hobby, almost like gambling but with more structure? And for those who do include it in their portfolio, how do you reconcile the extreme volatility with your broader investment strategy?

I’m interested in hearing different perspectives because I’m trying to figure out where I stand.

Most investors on the internet talks about the expected 10% annual return, based on historical returns.  
But is that true for the market today?

Historically the market is much cheaper than today, many investors seem not to care about valuations, and think AI will make explosive growth which will justify current valuations. However, we have a P/E over 31, and a Shiller P/E over 40, history tells us this won't end pretty.

Lets look at the numbers and model out the scenarios, to see what we can expect for returns.  
For this model we need a low, medium and high terminal P/E (what P/E will the S&P 500 end at in 10 years)  
and we need low, medium and high estimated earnings growth numbers.

Historically P/E has a median of 15, this is too low since it goes back to the 1800s, but in the past 50 years, the P/E median is \~20, in the past 20 and 10 years, it's \~25.

So let's go with:

* low: 20
* mid: 25
* high: 30

For growth estimations I looked at the past 20 years of earnings, 50% of the years were below or equal to 4% CAGR, which means this is most likely, and 20% of the years were above or equal to 8% CAGR.

To give some room for more expected growth, let's go with:

* low: 4%
* mid: 6.5%
* high 10% (only seen 4 times since 1880)

*(Note: these aren’t conservative.)*

We now can get the terminal value:

Terminal value = current EPS \* (expected growh rate)\^10 years  
current EPS = 219.52

From here we can see what Compounded Annual Growth Rate will get to the current share price from the terminal value in 10 years. For my estimations I get the following annual returns from the estimations:

* high: \~9% annual return
* mid: \~4.7% annual return
* low: \~1% annual return

This shows another picture of what is preached about 10% annual returns.

Weigh the pros and cons of the relatively small extra interest you get from a MMA account vs a HYSA right now for emergency funds, think about when you would need the funds, the risk of a bubble burst,  yadda yadda hopefully you all know his stuff. 

Well the next meeting. The youngest member of the club goes.

Confused I asked him what he meant and he told me he closed his MMA and bought dollar tree stock!?

I never once said to buy a single companies stock!? I'm an ETF person! And dollar tree? Where did that come from? I don't even shop there? Also I mentioned that your emergency savings may not be worth risking in an MMA and you stick it in 100% stocks!?!?!?

There are a few different research methods that I've found and liked, I wanted to create a discussion around them and see if there are any I'm missing out on.

1. 30 / 60 / 90 trend lines for timing the buys and sells over/under the line
2. Investors that publicly state buy/hold/sell suggestions (not any specific investor but monitoring multiple)
3. 3 / 6 / 12 month growth trends
4. Morning star risk rating, and fund classes 1-4 for balanced vs risky/industry specific funds
5. The 9 box val/growth and size metric and monitoring where in the chart I am vs where I want to be
6. Monitoring the percentage of investments (cash, foreign, domestic, ect)
7. Adding up the amount of a single stock across multiple funds to prevent overinvesting to one unintentionally 

I wanted to see if there are other things I should be considering, and if there are tools I can be using to help track these. I plan to build a tracker for this data, and have an API key with NASDAQ, among other sources... I initially wanted to build it for personal use but ended up beginning to build some complex features that I think others could benefit from so I was thinking of allowing other people to access it too (I already host it on a site I have for personal use anyway, so it would be easy for me to provide it if anyone was interested)

As I was thinking this, I realized there are probably so many other tracking methods that other people might need to be able to effectively use it. So I want to see what else is out there, and if there are some tools that exist (i.e. I dont want to spend the time to build something that I could just use freely, or not pay much for)

Not sure if everybody is following the podcasts, but for those who listened to this particular episode how is your conviction about factor investing?

My main conclusions:
 1) Publication bias: everyone want interesting things to read. According that, the sample chosen might indicate data mining, which can not be aligned with the out sample.
 2) Premium decay: arbitrages occurred already on the past due exchange of information, but now our capacity to share, analyse and execute everything has over escalated. So, lets say that the reaction to arbitrage is much faster.
 
Well, I am also reading the “Complete Guide to Factor-Based Investing” of A. Berkin and L. Swerdoe. Even if the premiums have gone, we might profit from diversification, mostly in small cap.

Current portfolio:
70% FTSE All World
12,5% Msci World Sector Neutral Quality
12,5% Msci World Momentum
5% Small Cap Value

After finally saving money and having some free cash to invest (10k) this march(2025), I put it in the market. I started with regular stocks and then went into options. All went well, I gained around 200$, then with options I was making gains of $3000. I got overconfident as usual and then the market tanked in April and I lost all my money. Basically totaling around $20k. From panic sells and what not. Ever since then I’ve been just in a deep state of depression about myself as a person, I blamed myself and I was embarrassed and thought I could do nothing right. Seeing the market reach ATH the moment I exited the market, and keep rising every day checking stocks daily just to see new highs made me feel even worse.

I recently found more inner peace by focusing on stuff that actually matters. Been going to the gym and spending more time outside and with people. 
Financially however things are not looking too bright. I still deal with a complete lack of confidence, embarrassment about money and yet another fear that once I start investing I will just lose it all ..

Declining interest rates, high short interest and possibility for cnpv voucher are also something to consider.

* A market crash right when I need the money
* Losing years of progress if I have to sell at the wrong time
* Missing out on safer options (like bonds or HYSA) that might fit a “house fund” better

My idea is to keep investing in the S&P 500 for about 10 years and then use that for a down payment or maybe buy outright if possible. But I know people usually say the stock market is for long-term investing, not for money you’ll need in a set timeframe.

So, does it make sense to invest in S&P 500 with a 10-year horizon if the goal is to buy a house?

For context, NASDAQ: MYNZ is pursuing a multi-cancer diagnostics strategy, with CRC commercialization now complemented by a high-need pancreatic target.

What to watch: feasibility readouts that confirm discovery-stage performance, initial clinical design outlines, and any partnering interest given the disease’s poor survival and screening gaps.

42% U.S. Stock Market 

24% International (ex-US) Developed Markets 

12% Emerging Markets 

14% U.S. Small Cap Value 

8% International (ex-US) Small Cap Value

The thing is I don’t have a simple method to weight them . It definitely would not make much sense to have equal weights.

Market cap could be an option, investing more in bigger and more solid companies and less in the rest… but they are overall all quite big.

P/E ratio is interesting too but I don’t think one should invest more in a company just because it seems undervalued.

EPS is another metric I think should be taken into consideration but again can’t be the main one right?

1nv69yh,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 08:02:07,Investing and Trading Scam Reminder,"For those new to Reddit and to investing and trading - please be aware that social media platform like Reddit, Discord, etc. can be a vector for scams and fraud. 

Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious. 

Social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to pig-buthering scams and pump-and-dump scams. - do not assume that an offer to ""help"" is legitimate.

1. Good explanation of pig-buthering here - [Pig butchering - how to spot](https://dfpi.ca.gov/news/insights/pig-butchering-how-to-spot-and-report-the-scam/)
2. Legitimate investment advisors do not use WhatApp, Telegram, Discord, etc. to provide tips. In the US - it is against regulation - specifically SEC Rule 17a-4 and FINRA Rule 3110. For example - brokers in the US that use social media for support do not offer investment advice. 
3. It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams. It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else.
4. Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media - bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks.
5. One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.
6. Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake. If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser, be wary.

Depending on where you live -  you can verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser. Most countries have legal requirements for investment advisors and brokers to be registered. 

United States - check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here - [https://brokercheck.finra.org/](https://brokercheck.finra.org/) You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here - [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)

If you believe that you or someone has been the victim of a trading or investing scam. Be aware of the following:

1. Do not send more money. Do not provide additional banking or credit card information. 
2. It is common to be contacted by additional scammers who may pretend to be law enforcement or private services to offer to ""recover"" funds for payment. This is a common follow-up scam. Law enforcement will never ask for money. 
3. If a login account was created. The password used is compromised. Change all passwords that are used. The password will be shared and sold to other scammers.  
4. If payment was sent via a credit card or bank transfer - report the transfers as fraud to your bank or credit card company.",4,2,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nv69yh/investing_and_trading_scam_reminder/,new,r/investing,0.67

* Short term: it’s going to push costs higher. $14B isn’t pocket change, and I wouldn’t be surprised if this weighs on margins in upcoming quarters.
* Long term: this screams commitment to AI. Meta isn’t just playing around with chatbots or ads they’re building infrastructure that powers recommendation systems, future metaverse projects, and whatever comes next in large-scale AI.
* Competitive angle: it positions them to better compete with the giants already dominating cloud + AI Microsoft, Google, Amazon. Instead of renting capacity, Meta is basically locking down the horsepower they’ll need for the next decade.

Personally, I like seeing this move. It reminds me of when Amazon poured billions into AWS back in the day. Painful upfront, but it turned into one of their biggest growth engines.

I am on my mission to make uber my no 1 position in my portfolio.

1)   $40B+ annual revenue, growing double digits, yet still priced cheaper than many mid-cap techs.

2) Over $1B+ FCF, with potential to compound and I dont think it’s priced in.

3) stakes in Grab and Didi

4) Partners & Key Moves Uber & Lucid: Nuro is supplying the self-driving tech for a robotaxi fleet of Lucid SUVs, to be deployed via Uber’s service. 20,000+ robotaxis over 6 years starting ~2026. 

5) Nuro has years of delivery-bot testing, deployment in limited domains; its robotaxi program via Uber-Lucid is just ramping up.  
So basically what nuro does it builds its own autonomous driving technology so instead of selling cars like tesla it sells the brains basically self driving technology.
So I tell how uber can use it for its advantage as uber.
So basically Lucid makes the cars, Nuro integrates their Autonomous tech into their cars and uber put  it on their platform.
I know it can put pressure on margins but I think uber will find its way to increase their margins somehow trust the management.

I know and understand the definition of book and market value (ie book and market value of equity). What I don't understand is why the market doesn't consider book value (wholly) when making investment choices and why they indirectly mix together accounting with other valuation methods instead.

In your traditional university stock competition, the main valuation you undertake for a stock is the DCF ie cash flow discounting to get enterprise value, then minus debt and add cash/non op assets (roughly) to get Equity value. Now, I compare that to the market price.

  
I have a problem with this because its mixing up accounting principles with market perception of value.

Book equity value is just Assets- Debt, and then  
Therefore, enterprise value is equity value + debt - non-operating assets (roughly)

  
Now, what I don't get is how we can use market cap equity value and then use accounting terms to get to enterprise value, or how we can simply use DCF to get enterprise value, then use accounting principles to get equity value.

  
We are combining methods of how markets wish to value things like enterprise value (DCF) or equity value (market cap), and then mixing accounting principles even tho the accounting view and market perception view are not using the same basis, so how can we mix both LOGICS??????????

Although, there is one reason making me a bit hesitant, that's why I'm looking for advise. 
The company is not doing great and I think I will not do great for a bit longer. The concern is, that they might take the stock away from the market, if it continues to go downhill.

""**McKinsey estimates that a cumulative $106 trillion in investment will be necessary through 2040 to meet the need for new and updated infrastructure.** The required investment spans seven critical infrastructure verticals, with transport and logistics requiring the largest share ($36 trillion), followed by energy and power ($23 trillion), digital ($19 trillion), social ($16 trillion), waste and water infrastructure ($6 trillion), agriculture ($5 trillion), and defense ($2 trillion).""

So im curious if there are any funds that you like that would cover a good portion of this, esp air traffic control and roads?

It seems like at least every other day, there is a doom and gloom story that the market is going to go down. Sometimes I look up the author and notice that their background is in journalism, and they have no formal education in business, or finance or economics. Sometimes I notice the people writing these articles are just out of college.  
I'm starting to wonder if the media companies require a certain amount of these doom and gloom articles to be put out every week, simply because it draws on fear and fear gets more clicks, which in turn gets more eyeballs on their ads. It would be interesting to look at all the articles that have been put out over the last 20 years or so to see if this is the way it has always been, no matter what is happening in the market. My guess is it has always been this way.  
Chatgpt made what I thought was a good point in saying, ""they put articles like this out, because markets are cyclical , and they know, eventually they will be correct."" If that is true, I find that very disingenuous.  
There have been bull runs that lasted 11 years. From what I looked up, it was 2009 to 2020. I can't say for sure, but my guess is these media companies were putting out doom and gloom articles the entire time.

Still I need to read news on the stock market but I'm growing tired of constantly seeing this stuff. I can ignore the article but I can't ignore the sensationalist leaning headlines.

seriously tho… if OnlyFans ever IPO’d, tell me that thing wouldn’t just blow up on day 1. same with Pornhub if they ever figured out how to list. people already pay subscriptions like it’s Netflix, margins are probably insane, and it’s not like demand is going away anytime soon.

closest thing I found is PLBY (Playboy). yeah that Playboy. they came back to the market through a SPAC in 2021, stock went crazy for a bit and now it’s literally under 2 bucks. basically feels like a scratch-off ticket. either it dies completely or one random headline and it’s back on the radar.

not telling anyone to buy (do what you want, it’s your money). I just think it’s funny how this is like the one vice industry wall street doesn’t openly mess with even tho it’s probably bigger than half the stuff they pump.

so yeah, what do you guys think:
– would you buy into OnlyFans if it ever listed?
– is PLBY just meme trash now or maybe worth a small gamble?

They focus on battery swapping technology instead of having to wait for charging - you just roll-up to one of their swap locations and it automatically swaps the battery out for a new one - and uses 100kWh battery packs which accelerates driving time and improves efficiency.

we are currently approx. 80/20   mostly large cap growth funds/cash.

Would like to adjust our investments to minimize losses when the crash happens while still staying invested.

I keep reading that the market is at all time highs and that a significant correction is coming soon.

I get that you can't time the market so moving funds out of our large cap growth funds with the intention of moving back into them after the crash is probably not a sound plan?

The only option I see that makes any sense is to move from our large cap grow funds into lower risk/return funds that won't get hit so hard when the crash happens and staying put in those lower risk/return funds.

It seems like the risk/return calculation for bonds is not very good. Ideas to keep our investments growing while reducing risk?

1nufyxd,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 11:17:11,"Honeywell, spin off, next General Electric? Opportunity? Division into 3 new companies: Materials, Automation and Aviation.","In 2021, General Electric decided to dismantle its historic conglomerate by dividing it into three autonomous companies: GE Aerospace, GE Vernova and GE HealthCare.

The overall capitalization of the three companies rose to around 474 billion dollars, compared to 290 billion before the split. In other words, the market recognized over 180 billion in additional value thanks to the separation.

Why does this happen? There are three main reasons. First: conglomerates often suffer from a market ""discount"", because investors struggle to give the right value to very different businesses. By separating them, each company becomes more readable and comparable to direct competitors. Second: capital management improves, because each entity can invest without having to compromise with the needs of other divisions. Third: a dedicated board of directors and management can move with greater clarity and accountability.

Let's talk about Honeywell. Today the company is organized into four major areas: Aerospace, Safety and Productivity Solutions, Building Technologies and Energy and Sustainability. Translated into a post-spinoff scenario, we could imagine three companies: Honeywell Aerospace, Honeywell Automation (which would combine the first two non-aerospace divisions), and Solstice Advanced Materials, focused on specialty chemistry and decarbonization technologies.

The shareholder letter decided to give 1 share of solstice for each share of Honeywell. The split of the other 2 divisions is expected at the end of 2026.

The Aerospace segment is by far the strongest and represents the main source of revenue. Honeywell supplies avionics, engines and auxiliary systems to giants such as Boeing and Airbus, but also to military aircraft and even future eVTOLs such as those from Joby Aviation. In addition to this, a significant portion comes from after-sales services: maintenance, repairs and overhauls which guarantee recurring flows.

Honeywell Automation, on the other hand, would focus on industrial automation, intelligent warehouses and security solutions. Think of scanners, robotics and voice-picking systems in Amazon warehouses, gas detectors and PPE for industrial workers, or energy and fire management systems for complex buildings such as airports and university campuses.

Finally, Solstice Advanced Materials would represent the “greener” and more futuristic side: CO₂ capture, green hydrogen, advanced battery materials and sustainable chemical solutions. A reality in its own right, with a positioning perfectly in line with the ESG priorities of global investors.

For an investor there are three paths. The first is to buy Honeywell shares now and wait for the split, then deciding whether to keep all the companies or sell the less interesting ones. The second is to wait for the spin-off and bet directly on the most promising horse, which in all likelihood will be Aerospace. The third is to mix.",41,8,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nufyxd/honeywell_spin_off_next_general_electric/,new,Unknown,0.86

A recent research note from a major international bank initiated coverage on one of the L4 players, WeRide, with an optimistic outlook. The report set a $20 target price. The bank’s reasonings:  
  
One, global reach. The company holds autonomous driving permits in a reported seven countries. This globalization focus is cited as a significant first-mover advantage, especially in international markets.  
  
Two, valuation logic. The $20 projection wasn't just a number; it was based on a discounted cash flow model. The analyst's conclusion is that the stock is 'undervalued compared to peers'.  
  
This brings up a crucial question for anyone looking at this space:  
  
Is the public market underestimating the commercialization potential and international scaling of these L4 companies? A 96% implied upside suggests the street is pricing in a much slower, tougher rollout than the analyst consensus.

Let me explain: I have been trying to buy a few Muni's on Fidelity and while several of the available bonds have an ""Ask"" and a Minimum listed, hardly any had any ""Bids"". Moreover, the couple that had Bids listed next to them had significant spread and when I put a bid that was HIGHER than that was listed, my orders fell through. That means the seller was unwilling to budge and could be sitting on the Munis for a long time. Hence my question about the liquidity of these securities? Or are there better trading platforms where Muni's are traded more ""efficiently"" than Fidelity Brokerage?

Anyone have any light to shed how easy it'll be to get a good price on both buy-side as well as sell-side if I got into these? Appreciate any advice.

I know all about tax benefits, TEY, YTW, Coupons, Call Options, AMT benefits etc etc and have decided I do need to buy Muni's so that's not the issue.

This bond is trading at a **discount** evident by the fact that it is selling below its face value (75<100), and also because the current yield is higher than the coupon rate (when prices go down, it pushes current yield above fixed coupon!).   
The reason it is trading at a discount is because its coupon rate (3%) is less than that of similar government bonds at 4.297%. Investors aren’t willing to pay full price for it. Because of this, demand for this bond has fallen, lowering its price, until its YTM   aligns with similar bonds (RBA benchmark: 4.297% and YTM = 4.88%)   
Additionally, the YTM value is greater the the current yield indicating it is at a discount, and it shows investors will have a capital gain at maturity. *(Fernando 2022)*",1,1,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nu072y/how_correct_is_my_analysis_of_this_bond/,new,Unknown,0.57

I do know that the general argument for growth over dividends is that dividends are immediately taxed and you do not control when that happens, whereas with selling appreciated stock, you have (some) control over the tax implications.

On the other hand, with dividends, I understand that there is a certain advantage to reinvesting dividends and picking up stock at a potentially lower price during lean times.

When moving from a fixed amount of equity to cash, the equivalent of DCA (dollar sell averaging??) seems to be to sell a constant number of shares periodically. (There have been other posts on that.)

In the first case, you have the cash and can always buy the shares (assume fractional shares are possible.) If you adjust the cash you spend (e.g., via Value cost averaging) you may sometimes not have the cash available.

In the second case, if you sell a variable number of shares to meet a cash point, you may come to a point where you don't have enough shares to make that. If you sell a fixed proportion of the shares, you can always sell.

Now let's throw in another variable. I have an ETF that I am going to sell and a stock I am going to buy. The ETF shares can either be correlated with the stock, or not.

What is the minimum risk strategy for making the transfer?

1. If the two equities are correlated, do I sell a fixed number of ETF shares or a fixed value of ETF shares? The cash obtained is used to purchase the stock.
2. If the two equities are not correlated, do I sell a fixed number of ETF shares or a fixed value of ETF shares? The cash obtained is used to purchase the stock.

1ntwo3a,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 18:51:32,1 year of investing: here is my outlook,"Hey guys I wanted to make a little list here of all of my wins and losses. My dos and donts of my personal finances.

So let's begin where ive been putting my money. Now im pretty happy with how I did it. I've had a huge sum just rotting (that's how you gotta see cash, as literally rotting) rotting in my bank account.

So step 1: get off your ass and put it in a mutual fund. ""Oh its not as good"" blah blah its better than just having it sit there and you do nothing about it. Procrastinate procrastinate... just do it.

Step 2: learn about ETFs. The more you learn about mutual funds the more you realize theyre ripping you off. So start putting your own money into a self directed investing account.

Step 2.5 (for canadians): Use TSFA or HSFA or RRSP. If you're young and make decent money, use HSFA. If you make very little money use TSFA. If you make a lot of money, use both. Remember there is a limit to how much you can put in and rules about them so go learn.

Step 3: dont start gambling. Basically you (me not you this is what I did) have no idea what youre doing and now youre just guessing what might go up or down. People on tik tok saying Costco is a buy or amazon or Google or whatever. I bought them all. I still have some but here's my rule right now: only hold what you're willing to lose. If you've got 1000 in your account then only holding 10 in Microsoft might seem like a failure since its up 19% so you might be tempted to put 200 in. But take it from me, im still holding onto stocks that ive over invested in and theyre losing. 

Step 4: go slow. You cant beat the market. Just put in money bit by bit. And if you have a big chunk of money, just put it into something safe and buy little by little every week. Set aside a reasonable amount from your paycheck and invest in the same reliable ETFs

Step 5: here is what i invest in:
40% S&P 500, (best option)
10% Gold and/or silver(market stablizer)
10% Uranium (betting on global turbulence)
20% Global markets (diversify)
20% China (risky wealth building) 

So my results after a year

My mutual fund with 60% of my money (in 1.5years) = +16%
My TSFA with 30% = +7.5%
My HSFA with 10% (8months) = +12.5%
S&P 500 = +19% (damn I really thought I did better than that)

1ntrlou,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 15:32:47,Dividends + Margin Account = Growth machine?,"(TLDR at the end, this is a long post)

So I had an idea, but it feels wildly too good to be true, and before risking my assets into a fool’s errand, I’d like to aggressively stress test it. I welcome all criticism and really want to build a strongman argument for (or against) it before moving forward.

I have been wracking my brain trying to find fault in it, and while I can see some obvious pitfalls, they have yet to convince me **not** to go forward.

First for context, we have been comfortably borrowing to invest for a while, and generating great returns with a healthy mix of growth etf’s + some generally high yield dividend split corps (think bk.to). We currently have approx 40% growth compared to the initial loan size, and are now generating 18.15% aggregate yield. On the side of this, I’ve been toying with a margin account, buying in and out of healthy canadian stocks with low volatility, and selling back a few cents above for small but fun profits. Grew about 1k to 5k in the last 6 weeks doing so, but I digress.

The idea that struck me is, what if I combined the power of 15% + yield machines with the extra buying power of a margin account. And I am not JUST talking about the 3.33x leverage it would give on day one, but the realization that every single distribution that comes in would theoretically further boost our buying power by the same 3.33x.

For the sake of argument, let’s assume a simple 30k/70k scenario in which I invest 30k and obtain 100k in buying power. Let’s also temporarily ignore any stock price change for now. Out of concern for a rapid market downturn and potential margin calls, let’s also stick to never using more than 60% of the total buying power. Meaning I’m only using 60k of the 100k on day 1, keeping a (I think) healthy 40k/40% spread from my max.

This 60k, invested at 15%, would net 9k a year, or a clean 750 per month. Normally, I’d reinvest that 750 month to month, meaning each distribution actually gets rolled into the 15% calculation and the actual result by the end of the year would be slightly higher than 15% (but of course, this would potentially be negated or further amplified by the price variations that will of course happen).

Now the real kicker here is that inside a margin trading account, that 750 is actually also leveraged at 30% and thus creates 2500 in new buying power. Using the same safety formula, let’s only use 60% (1500) and reinvest THAT. Now we’re making 15% of that additional 1500 (225/18.75 per month). 

Anyone can draw up a quick excel and understand how supercharged this makes DRIP/Div reinvesting. I did one, with a bunch of different variables, where you can play with the percentage of the max buying power used (you can even start aggressively at say 80% and then tone it down to 60% over the course or x months etc.), you can play with assumed yield, initial seeding money, you can set it to reserve a portion of the unused buying power for the borrowing costs and eventual tax cost that will inevitably become hard to sustain without tapping directly into the margin, borrowing rate etc. 

All of those variables slightly affect how much, but in all scenarios, you’re greatly speeding up the compounding effect, and one can, depending on risk level, initial seeding cash vs portfolio that is being leveraged, reach the equivalent of 5x the month 1 income after only 48 months. Anyone with sufficient time, ie 5-10 years could rapidly generate silly amounts of passive income (and portfolio size).

Here are my actual numbers as of today, in a very top-heavy, start-aggressive scenario:

**Aggressive Scenario**

Initial cash: 30k

Initial Portfolio leveraged: 210k

This gives me a potential buying power of 590k.



Using 95% of it on day 1 :  560,5k @ 18.15% (my current aggregate yield) = 96 644,21$ or 8 053,68 per month. 



This means that on mo 1, the dividend unlocks an additional 26 845,61 of buying power. Because I want to rapidly reduce my risk level and increase the cushion of used margin, I do the following:



\-First account for borrowing cost and eventual owed tax on those dividends  = 698,87 + 2953,60 = 4 506,66 (the borrowing cost is actually taken off of the remaining equity, and the tax cost I’m just choosing to artificially subtract from the remaining equity).



Of the remaining amount, I then reinvest a gradually decreasing %, so having started at 95, and aiming to reduce to 75 over the course of 48 months, I’m now reinvesting 94.58% of the buying power, = 21 222,01.

At 18.15%, this bumps my annual income to 100 496,01 or 8374,67, or a difference of 320.99/mo. That’s a 3.98% “salary raise” lol. Of course this happens month after month, and because everything is compounded, the rate of increase *also* increases. By the end of mo 12, with the math explained above, I should have gone up to 147 184,01 /yr, a 52.2% increase. By the end of year 4, this amount is up to 505 566,08. You don’t want to know what it looks like after 10 years, because it makes no sense to the human brain lol. (In any case I don’T think one could get there because the size of the loan gets above 5M which seems to be the margin loan limit, at least with my current broker - at any rate, by that point, one might want to start reducing their exposure and just enjoying the proceeds of what’s left, which would put any sane person MORE than very, very comfortable.

And this is where I’m starting to doubt what my eyes and my math is telling me - I’m a little (a lot) incredulous that this could actually work, and again, I’d like to fully stress test this notion because it feels too good to be true.

A few things I’ve thought of so no one wastes time on the basics - but by all means, if I missed something else that should be obvious, do enlighten me.



**A)All of this only works so long as there is drastic market drop/recession/war/pandemic etc.** 

This is where your individual risk tolerance varies, and one could choose to start with a lower borrowing power used %, say 65%, and stick to that. This slows down the math, but doesn’t change the fundamental effect of having dividend distributions leveraged at 3.3x (and then using whatever portion you’re comfortable with) 



**B)All of this only works so long as my yield remains that high, implying that none or very few of my securities crash, reduce, or stop their distribution altogether.**

Again, mileage may vary based on your comfort level with risk, and yes, it requires a lot of watching the market for signs of trouble. There is, of course, not a single thing that guarantees safety from such an event. In our specific case, we hedge against this knowing that we have an unusually high job security, a sizeable chunk of investment that will NOT be mixed up with any of this and that covers the full borrowed amount for at the very least the early, aggressive couple of months.



**C)Ultimately, margin calls, because of the above**

Yes, they happen, yes I understand how they can happen and what it would mean, and again, keeping a comfortable cushion + having a backup source of dry-ish funds to inject if shit hits the fan is key.



**D)Ballooning debt amount and inability to actually withdraw the dividends so long as the loan is not paid off**

In my 48 year scenario above, the loan has indeed reached a terrifying size of 2,785M. Because of how margins work, I’d have to wait until dividends reduce the margin-used portion (at 505k a year it would be over 5 years of not touching the money and letting the dividends pay it off, and I’m not even accounting for borrowing costs and taxation here), so the best way out I can think of is to just sell off the securities, shut down the margin account and cash out the entirety of the portfolio, to then reinvest it at more comfortable rates, whatever those may be. At the same 18.15%, and again, assuming no portfolio growth at all, we’d be looking at 241 361 of gross passive income, without any associated loan anymore.

And that’s it, that’s all I can think of, I might edit the post as I think or read some answers to save everyone time. What am I missing here? Any reason NOT to do this?



TL;DR: If one invests in a margin-trading account, and high yield securities (15% and up), those dividend distributions compound extremely fast since every new cash injection in the account adds 3.33x the amount in buying power. One can go from any modest initial seed money and very rapidly multiply their portfolio size, and passive income if that’s what you’re after. I think my math and my spreadsheet are clean, but I feel like it’s too good to be true, and I’d like someone to help me stress test the theory or point out whichever flaw I may have missed.

1nto9qg,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 13:27:47,Investment advice from a friend... WDYT?,"Imagine a situation. Jonny's portfolio is fully in stocks like PLTR, IONQ, OKLO, QUBT, etc... Jonny found them up on Reddit. He's happy with the portfolio being 5x in just a year, seeing how his 10k became 50k. What a deal! At night he dreams that the next year will bring another 5x and his 50k will turn into 250k. Power of compounding! He wonders if it's a good idea to take a loan and sell his girlfriend's jewels to invest in those ""5x"" stocks. When he's a millionaire, he will shower her with diamonds.

In search of advice, Jonny comes to a friend, Kattie, whom he respects for warning him about using leverage and teaching him the concept of volatility. That saved all his money in the past.

Jonny: Hey K! What do you think about that idea? I'm really afraid I'm missing a great opportunity to get rich. Those companies are sure to be the next Nvidia, Apple, and Google. I want to take a risk and go all in.

Kattie: Dude… why do you think these companies are great investments in the first place? Have you seen the financial results and checked the valuation? The P/E and P/S ratios are so insane that I wouldn't even bother looking deeper.

Jonny: You should see what people on Reddit are saying! This is the ultimate game, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. AI will replace all current jobs, and quantum will replace all modern computers. Just yesterday the CEO of that quantum stock said they're the next Nvidia. I'm already up 5x. It means something!

Kattie: Yeah, it means you're a gambler - and CEOs are really great at pumping hype and making themselves money. Look, successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Take your beloved Apple, Nvidia, or Google and look at their history. In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey. In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with its products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. In 2010 it still wasn't too late to buy Apple stock, right? In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was too late? Ha!

Jonny: I don't get your point.

Kattie: Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products, all because management is big on words, selling a ""we're the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action, in product. With a great business, you don't need a middleman selling you a story; you can witness the impact yourself. A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research; take your time. Even after five years, we'll still offer a great opportunity."" They are not loud, because they have a moat! A scam business sells you a beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist. Do you really think those companies you invested in are the next Nvidia, Google, and Apple? Have they demonstrated excellence multiple times over the previous years? Did they really changing the world? Do you see it yourself?

Jonny: Well, I guess we need to wait and see if they'll really create a product that will change our lives. Now I see why you brought up Google in 2005 - it was already impacting everyone's life, but it wasn't a missed opportunity. It was just the beginning.

Kattie: Exactly! Great companies continue to be great and reinvest their talent into developing more great stuff.

Jonny: What should I do with my portfolio? Sell it? Buy Nvidia and Google?

Kattie: I won't tell what you should do. If I were in this situation, I'd first consider myself very lucky. I made good money on a blind gamble. Thanks, life! Then I'd be smarter with my investments. I'd take my gambling profit and reinvest it into an index fund by dividing it into 24 equal chunks and buying one chunk every month. That would benefit me if the stock market crashes because of all the insane gambling hype happening right now. I'd use those two years to learn financial analysis and how to interpret companies balance sheets. That would give me the tools to invest in the market.

Jonny: But 5x, I really afraid that I might miss the next round.

Kattie: Remember, 99% of start-ups fail, even if at some point their stock price rises 10x in a short period of time. That means you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Short-term gains != long-term success. In a gamble, it's better to take a profit and leave the table. 

Jonny: I guess you're right. I'll ask what folks on Reddit think about this situation.

1ntlfop,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 11:41:49,Micron (MU) has lots of room to grow,"Micron Technology is a global leader in memory and storage solutions, a foundational part of nearly all modern electronics. Over the past six months, Micron’s share price has surged by nearly 70 percent, and its year-to-date gain now stands at over 92 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations.

Behind this rally lies Micron’s growing strategic importance in the AI and data center economy.
Its memory chips are increasingly essential for powering artificial intelligence applications, with top-tier customers like NVIDIA, Apple, Samsung, and Lenovo relying on Micron’s cutting-edge technology.

Top analysts from Citi, TDCowen, and Deutsche Bank remain bullish ahead of upcoming earnings, pointing to tailwinds from the expanding data center market, which is forecasted to grow by 33 percent annually through 2030. In Q4 2025 alone, analysts expect a staggering 109 percent year-over-year revenue increase.

With industry momentum, strong financials, and unmatched exposure to AI demand, Micron is shaping up to be one of the strongest long-term semiconductor bets of 2025.

Despite Micron’s impressive 2025 rally, many investors believe it still trades at a discount to its true value. The key reason is Micron's forward price-to-earnings ratio remains significantly lower than peers. Its 2026 forward P/E of just 9.72x is well below the semiconductor industry average.

This disconnect exists because much of Micron’s value lies in its exposure to high-bandwidth memory, a crucial technology for powering AI workloads. Micron’s HBM product lines are sold out through 2026 and the next-generation HBM4 chips are already generating buzz.

Micron is evolving from a cyclical chipmaker into a long-term growth story. With AI infrastructure booming, its undervaluation won’t last much longer.

Wall Street is focused on Micron ahead of its next earnings release. In recent weeks, Citi,
Mizuho, and Susquehanna all raised their price targets, with Citi and Susquehanna now
targeting $200 and Mizuho not far behind at $182.

Citi also reiterated its Buy rating, citing stronger-than-expected demand for AI-ready memory chips. Micron’s earnings per share expectations have risen accordingly, with investors anticipating continued upside surprises.

Micron already delivered an EPS of $3.03 in Q4 2025, significantly beating estimates, and
analysts expect the trend to continue. Key themes to watch in the upcoming report include AI product demand, margin guidance, and capacity updates for 2026.

The AI revolution is triggering a record wave of infrastructure investment. From Microsoft’s $30 billion supercomputer project in the UK to Nvidia’s backing of OpenAI with up to $100 billion in funding, the scale of global AI investment is massive.

Micron sits at the heart of this growth, supplying high-bandwidth DRAM and NAND memory required to keep AI models running. With OpenAI’s Stargate project planning
multi-gigawatt-scale data centers, Micron’s role as a memory provider is becoming even more critical.

Micron has even reorganized internally to reflect this shift, aligning its product roadmap to the growing demands of the AI and cloud markets.

Micron’s financial foundation is solid. The company continues to ramp up R&D investment, especially in AI-focused memory, while improving profitability. Recent quarters show operating margin expansion, and Micron’s R&D budget now exceeds historical averages, reflecting its strategy to stay ahead in HBM, DRAM, and NAND technology.

This combination of profitability improvements and innovation spending makes Micron uniquely well positioned to capitalize on future AI cycles.

Micron has built a strong track record of earnings performance, consistently delivering beats on EPS and revenue.

In Q4 2025, Micron reported an EPS of $3.03 compared to estimates ranging from $2.53 to
$2.86. Revenue was $11.3 billion, also above expectations. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double beats in fiscal 2025.

Micron has now beaten expectations for eight straight quarters. This consistency reflects both demand strength and operational execution and has been a key driver of investor confidence.

Micron remains attractively valued even after its run-up. Its forward P/E is 13.4x, well below the sector median of 19.2x. Its forward price-to-sales ratio near 3.7x is also lower than that of leading AI peers like Nvidia and AMD.
This valuation gap is notable, especially given Micron’s exposure to the same AI megatrends as its higher-multiple competitors. Even a re-rating to average sector multiples would imply a substantial upside, with some analysts suggesting prices well above $200 per share.
While the bullish case for Micron is strong, risks remain. 

Competition from Samsung and SK
Hynix is intensifying, particularly in high-bandwidth memory. The memory market itself is highly cyclical and could be affected by any slowdown in AI or cloud infrastructure spending.

There has also been regular insider selling and approximately $200 million in quarterly
stock-based compensation. Although much of this is standard practice in tech and not tied to
bearish sentiment, it still contributes to dilution. In addition, any missteps in yield, supply chains, or global trade could pressure margins.
Micron holds approximately $11.9 billion in cash and $14 billion in debt, resulting in low net
leverage. Its investment-grade profile gives it the flexibility to raise capital at favorable terms if needed. This reduces reliance on equity and helps limit shareholder dilution.

This financial strength provides a buffer against the memory industry’s inherent volatility and
supports Micron’s long-term strategy.
Looking further ahead, Micron’s FY2027 forward P/E projection is just 10.5x. This sets up an attractive long-term buying opportunity, particularly as AI spending is expected to grow
throughout the decade.

Micron is well positioned to benefit across multiple AI investment cycles, not just a short-term surge.

From a technical perspective, Micron’s RSI currently signals overbought conditions, suggesting the stock may cool off in the near term. However, its price remains well above the long-term simple moving average, confirming a strong bullish trend.

Crucially, the fundamentals support the technical momentum. Robust demand, earnings strength, and favorable industry trends provide a solid foundation, suggesting that any pullbacks may represent long-term buying opportunities.

Governments worldwide are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. The United States has
supported projects in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Norway, while other nations like the UK, UAE,
and Japan are also building next-gen AI facilities.

As a key supplier of high-performance memory, Micron stands to benefit from this global infrastructure buildout. Its products are necessary components in nearly every advanced AI deployment on the horizon.
Micron insiders, including CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, regularly sell shares through pre-scheduled trading plans. While the lack of insider buying may be seen as a mild negative, it is typical in the tech industry where executives are already highly exposed to company stock.

Micron also issues about $200 million in stock-based compensation each quarter. While this
contributes to modest dilution, it is not excessive compared to other major tech firms and is an accepted tool for attracting and retaining top talent.

Given Micron’s growing earnings and market position, this dilution is manageable and does not materially weaken the bullish case.

Micron offers a rare combination of explosive earnings growth, AI-driven product demand,
attractive valuation, and a strong balance sheet. While competition and market cycles require ongoing attention, the upside potential significantly outweighs the risks.

As Micron continues to execute and deliver results, it remains a strong buy ahead of earnings and into 2026.

Investor sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive. Retail traders view Micron as one of the leading beneficiaries of the AI boom, and institutional investors are showing strong conviction.

Hedge funds have increased their stakes and long-term investors like pension funds are holding steady.

With confidence from both Wall Street and Main Street, Micron is becoming one of the most widely embraced infrastructure plays in the AI space.

The semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation powered by AI and data. Micron
Technology sits at the center of this shift. As covered throughout this report, Micron’s rising
earnings, leadership in next-gen memory, and robust financial position give it a powerful
long-term edge.

The company is positioning itself for the future of technology, from generative AI to cloud
computing and beyond. Even after a substantial run-up in 2025, Micron remains attractively valued with room to grow.

All signs point to Micron Technology being a top semiconductor pick for 2025 and the years
ahead.",0,9,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntlfop/micron_mu_has_lots_of_room_to_grow/,new,Unknown,0.44
1ntk8nk,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 10:57:15,Bankrupt/Closed businesses question?,"EDIT: Answer provided almost immediately- thanks! 

I've tried searching for the answer and am not finding it, so I'm hoping someone knows: 

When you invest in an index fund, what happens if one of the company disappears? 
(Eg it goes bankrupt or it closes) 
Especially if it is a higher percentage of the index fund? 

Does it differ if it's a mutual fund vs ETFs? 

Are the companies that compromise the index fund set in stone? 
Do you lose that percentage of your investment, or does it get reallocated into the other companies already in the index fund and the percentages for all get adjusted? 
Does the whole index fund get shut down, and money refunded or lost? 

Or does the manager/s of the index fund, find a different company to sub in for the company that no longer exists? 
Does this still happen if it's a passive fund? 
(Are they already swapping companies in and out if some are performing badly? I haven't been watching the complete makeup of funds I've already invested in to notice if they changed since I bought shares) 

I understand/assume there'd be a huge value loss immediately if this happened eap with large companies, so I'm not asking about the value per se, but what then happens with the fund? 



(I realised a lot of the index funds have the same couple of major companies making up a solid chunk of their allocation. I realise the likelihood of eg Amazon suddenly shutting down is incredibly minimal, and I do realise there are likely legal protections in place to prevent this occurring, but it made me very curious with ""but what if?!!"". When I've tried to search for the answer, the search engines keep only giving me information for if the broker/fund management company closes- which is NOT what I'm curious about)  ",2,4,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntk8nk/bankruptclosed_businesses_question/,new,Unknown,0.59

Neodymium is the leading option but Iron-Nitride is expected to surpass this when production increases in the long term.

1nse5u1,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 23:30:15,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

1nsa2sl,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 19:57:05,You can't beat the market by buying good companies for the same reason you can’t get rich betting on the best football teams,"The idea that information is “priced in” is a notoriously tricky concept for new investors (I know I struggled with it for a while), and it occurred to me that a sports betting analogy might help.

You can go out and bet on who is going to win tomorrow's NFL games, but for most of those games, there's a lot of information out there that leads people to expect that one team is more likely to win. Take, for example, tomorrow's Bills-Saints game. There's a lot of information suggesting that the Bills are a much better team, and are much more likely than the Saints to win. As a result, if you want to bet that the Bills will win, you're not going to find someone who will take the other side of that bet straight up.

To get someone to take the other side of the bet, you have to concede something: either give them better odds (ie they get a bigger payout if their unlikely bet pays off), or a spread, meaning a number of points that the favored team must win by for the bet to pay out (in this example, the Bills have to win by at least 15 tomorrow, if they win by 7, the people who bet on the Saints get the money). The expectation that the Bills are going to win is priced in, the odds or spread adjust until equal numbers of people are willing to take either side of the bet.

The stock market works the same way. There's a lot of information that leads people to expect that Apple will continue to grow and perform much better than the average company. As a result, to get someone to agree to sell you an Apple share, you have to pay a high price: 35 times Apple's current earnings per share (compared to an average of about 26.6 times for the US stock market as a whole). If everyone expects Apple to do better as a company than the market in general, the price of the stock will rise until there's an equal number of buyers and sellers. The expectation that Apple will have above average earnings in the future is already priced in, just like the expectation that the Bills will beat the Saints.

Everyone agrees the Bills will probably beat the Saints. To bet on it, you need to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. Everyone agrees Apple will probably have better earnings than the average company. To bet on it (ie buying Apple shares instead of a total market index fund), you have to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. You can't get rich betting on teams that everyone knows are good, and you can't beat the market buying companies that everyone knows are good. Available information is priced in.

Edit: I stopped watching football a while back, so the fact that the Bills are -14.5 vs the Saints is wild to me.

Edit2: If you think you have a method for finding mispriced stocks, that’s not necessarily in conflict with my point here. The point is that it’s more complicated than simply buying companies widely regarded as good, in contrast to what new investors often assume. (That said I do tend to be skeptical that retail investors can expect to find a market-beating strategy)

Edit 3: the Bills won 31-19, meaning that they won the game but did not cover the spread, and people who put money on the Saints won.",163,127,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nsa2sl/you_cant_beat_the_market_by_buying_good_companies/,new,Unknown,0.75

I've recently started earning in ILS (previously GBP) - i had been investing in Vanguard's lifestrategy 80% through vanguard (which took GBP - although maybe the core etf was in something else), but in losing by British residency, I have also lost the ability to continue investing through that route.

I'm interested in still investing in vanguard's 80% life strategy as I feel comfortable with it, and have had very good returns, but now through IBRK. The only option I can find is 'VNGA80', or 'VNGD80', both of which are in EUR. this is my first time investing in my non living currency - and was wondering how much of a risk this is (especially ILS and EUR)?

For some reason i'd feel a bit safer being invested in USD, although I don't have a factual basis for this other than 'gut feeling'. Considering this, I was also thinking about investing 80% in 'VT' (or 'VWRL' once I fully understand the difference), which is in USD, and then finding a suitable bond market ETF to invest the remaining 20% in, in essence, making my own version of VNGA80 that I can adjust the bond / equity ratios along with my risk appetite.

1nrrne6,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 06:17:01,Is Google still cheap? 10 year expected returns,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better.

However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it.

When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value.  
After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years.

From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500.

Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations.

Anyways here are the results:

FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR  
EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR  
Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR

So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price?  
Probably not.

Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs.

That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding.

Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels.

A research analyzing these responses found that higher income groups become significantly more pessimistic about current economic conditions during financial market stress, compared to lower income households. However, wealthy households show no increased pessimism about future economic prospects.

This likely reflects greater exposure to financial markets among wealthy households, they feel immediate stress from market volatility but have confidence in their long term financial resilience. I found this bit surprising as I thought people with lesser wealth would be more concerned about it being eroded away than the wealthy folks. 

The study also revealed that currency fluctuations and government debt spreads impact household confidence more than stock market volatility in India, which is the opposite pattern from developed economies where banking sector stress dominates.

1nrnsvc,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 02:11:17,Any resources about retiring and living off of dividends?,"All of the information out there seems to be oriented towards WITHDRAWING money from your accounts after you retire. The issues are things like sequence of return risk, percentage of withdrawals, increasing your holdings in bonds, all sorts of topics that just don't apply to people like us, who plan to live off our dividends in retirement.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the entire retirement ""industry"" is geared towards this, and not towards living off of dividends. My free advisor at Fidelity is definitely not oriented towards dividend investing, either now, or in retirement.

I feel like there's some information that I'm missing that only applies to dividend investing. Maybe things like switches in your investments to make now to reduce risk, maximizing dividend income safety, how to make sure your portfolio keeps ahead of inflation. I'm pretty sure that there's plenty of other topics that I'm missing.

Are there any good resources about **LIVING OFF OF DIVIDENDS IN RETIREMENT**? For example, Armchair Income is great - for investing for dividends. I am a devoted follower, watch him every week, always take his advice with a healthy grain of salt, and do my own research.

It was priced monthly, so presumably marketable. It had a 10-12% yield, which was fairly typical for bond funds at the time. But the income was never reported on her her tax forms; however, it did show up as a ""RECIP DIST"" on the 1099s with a note, ""Your distributions have been adjusted to reflect proper tax reportability."" She had her taxes prepared by a CPA so presumably he knew what he was doing.

The NAV of the fund steadily declined over the 7 years she held it. I don't think the dividend was 100% return of capital. (What would be the point anyway of buying a fund that paid back mostly return of capital, unless it was some kind of tax oddity?)

I lost 80% of my portfolio due to too many call contracts (on another stock that was performing well). I turned $700CAD to $2600USD like a week ago (yes, I'm a poor). I've never earned that much money investing before, and I knew right then there I should just pull half out to lock in the gains, or wait a bit and go back in at an optimal when it has a reasonable dip. Or maybe look at some other stocks.

But no, instead stock started falling further, activated stop limits, price went down, caused more people to sell, activated more limit stops, etc. The stock had been lingering around 9.50 - 10.50 for almost a week - after that huge drop it went down to $7. What's worse is I had a reasonable number of puts (bought too high) and I wanted to get rid of them. Eventually it broke even and I sold it, thinking it would surge back up at any minute.

I was also buying additional calls because their price was so slow, I was sure that there would be at least a mild rally and I'd be able to get maybe 50 - 60% of my money back.

Eventually today it went up to 8.06, and I only had 2 days before expiring. I didn't want to risk holding onto it much longer only for it to fall more. So I sold it and lost $1200USD.

You know what the best part is? It raised 25% immediately the next day after I sold and I would earned over double if I just waited 12 more hours. It went up to like $9.10, and my breakeven was 9.12

Not looking for financial advice, admittedly I've only been in and out of investing for a few years on WealthSimple.

I hope this doesn't break the rules but I'm wondering what more experienced investors in a similar situation would consider doing. If that does break the rules, perhaps there's a way that's safer. I've been looking into thetagang but I just don't have enough money unless it's a penny stock.

1nr97zy,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 14:36:43,Prophecy-Based Trading Strategy,"It is really simple.

This is about the “Prophet Trading Method,” a true golden tip.

There is a very famous prophet named Baba Vanga, known for an accuracy rate of about 85 percent.

If you read her prophecies carefully, you can see the future direction of humanity.

That is where you begin your reasoning.

Of course, not every prophecy comes true, but the important part is the overall direction they suggest.

You can view prophecy as an indicator of humanity’s general course.

So if you take long positions in sectors that align with that direction, even if you face temporary losses, some stocks will naturally rise over time.

For example, if you study the prophecies closely, you will find hints about breakthroughs in human biotechnology, solar energy, renewable energy, AI, quantum computing, and so on.

On the other hand, investing in directions not mentioned in the prophecies, such as oil or coal, could be considered a foolish choice.

The idea is simple. Take the results inferred from the prophecies, select the sectors that match, buy the ones that are undervalued, wait, and then sell when the time is right.

I personally invested heavily in Lithium Americas for its role in clean energy and waited a long time.

Recently, I was fortunate that Lithium Americas surged, and I made a good profit.

You can also find Baba Vanga’s prophecies on Wikipedia for reference.

If you are not sure, focus on renewable energy, AI, quantum computing, or biotechnology.

If you wait a few years, the chances are high that you will not lose money.",0,6,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nr97zy/prophecybased_trading_strategy/,new,Unknown,0.14

Part of the learning curve is recognizing the fact that a share price can decrease, without ANY fundamental change in the company. The company can absolutely obliterate all expectations, and the ""share price"" can still drop. 
My point is, I sold many lots early because I was new, and impatient. 
I've learned two things. 1- DCA all day. 2- if you believe in the companies fundamentals and nothing has changed, then do not react to outside influence. Do not sell, continue to DCA all day. 
Off the top of my head, I sold: RIG at 0.64, MP at 18, IONQ at 9, ZDGE at 2.4, WD at 43, INTC at 26, RGTI at 8, NOTE at 2, CARR at 55, GME at 13 (PRIOR TO THE SHORT), NIO at 4, ON at 30, RR at 1.40,  ERIC at 3.3, XOM at 60, GE at 130 (13 pre split), UPST at 19, MU at 50, TTD - i sold at 561, but its been RSd and I dont know today's equivalent. 

 All of those above are higher today, than my sell price. Also, when I sold, at whatever time, with the exception of WD and CARR (they where green, but nothing crazy) they where in the red, for sure. The moral of the story was, nothing changed. I sold due to a reaction of the market, NOT, the company. 
Here's the kicker. I'm still up 300% overall  and 1000%+ percent lots, because I learned my lesson. I identified my error, ( I used to panic )
I swallowed that lesson. Took it in stride, and made the change. I stuck with PLTR ( at its worse, down 90+ percent) , RKLB (worst , down 88+) , PL (down 60%). And have been DCA all day, and don't watch the day-to-day. The companies are execution, nothing has changed fundamentally, and the outcome has been nothing but amazing. The result? Today , I'm in the green 300%+ overall. Why? I identified my errors, and key point. ACCEPTED IT AS TRUE. Make the change. And win. (FYI I'm currently down 20% on LIDR, but, I cannot do my job without LIDAR, so for me, the need is there. Company fundamentals haven't changed, ill continue to DCA)

1nqrymi,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 00:24:21,"Is my explanation of how bonds work, correct?","Thank you very much for your help. Very much appreciated!



**How do bonds work?**  
Put as simply as I could:

1. Government/firm issues a bond with a coupon rate (interest rate) similar to the market interest rate.
2. **Primary market:** according to RBA (*2022),* when an investor has purchased the bond **for the first time,** this is called buying in the **primary** **market**. *(This first price of bond depends on interest rate, term of bond, and price of similar bonds).*
3. **In the primary market, the buyer pays the face (nominal) value of the bond, and the yield (aka return) matches the bonds coupon rate.** The buyer will want the coupon rate/yield to be higher than market interest rates.
4. But if later on the bondholder decides to sell the bond before maturity, (due to many factors) it will be sold on the '“**secondary market.”**
5. **In the secondary market -** bond market price fluctuates on top of the face value because of supply and demand. There are many factors affecting bond like competing market interest rates (shown below) and the yield of the bond. Makes sense, right? When market prices exceed the face value of a bond, you are paying at a premium. When market prices are below face value of a bond, you are paying at a discount
6. Bondholders will need to recalculate the yield, as the coupon rate no longer matches the yield (because market prices have changed). This is done using this simple formula: coupon / market price x 100 **The relationship between the market price and bond yield is inverse.** *(EconplusDal, 2017)*",9,9,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqrymi/is_my_explanation_of_how_bonds_work_correct/,new,Unknown,0.8

Right now I’m aiming for about a 70/30 split between individual stocks and an ETF. I’ve already funded the ETF side, but for the stock portion I’m trying to narrow down my picks.

My goal is to grow this portfolio at 15–20% annually (minimum) to outperform the ETF, then roll the gains back into ETFs later. I understand the risks and taxes involved, and I don’t mind some volatility since I’m still learning.

The main stocks I’m considering are:
	•	AMD – strong potential if they land new deals and improve their software side.
	•	UNH – looks undervalued; the investigation doesn’t seem too damaging, and the stock hasn’t fully corrected since the murder news.
	•	SHOP.TO – e-commerce is still growing, and last quarter’s earnings beat gave it a strong rebound.

I’m also keeping an eye on GOOGL and researching NVO.

I suspect a larger market correction is coming eventually, but I still think there’s time to benefit from the current bullish trend.

TL;DR: New investor, already in an ETF, now looking for individual stocks that can realistically return 15–20% yearly over the next few years. Thoughts on my picks (AMD, UNH, SHOP.TO) and any counters/alternatives?

1nqlo50,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 19:14:01,"SPT Sprout Social - No one talks about it, and i dont know why","Here’s everything you need to know about SPT - Sprout Social. If you still believe the company is not undervalued after reading this, I can’t help you.

1. In the era of AI, data plays a crucial role. Sprout Social connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this amount of data.

2. Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance.

3. Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.


Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:

- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.


Risks:
- „But there is an investigation“. That’s for wrongdoing. I think there were 200 cases like this last year. Let’s say they have to pay $25 million - $23 million will be paid by D&O, and Sprout will pay $2 million. Thats nothing.

- „I make more profit than they do“. Value doesn’t necessarily equate to profit. Over the past three years, they’ve acquired three companies. The product has received new features and a significant amount of AI integration. Growth is more crucial than profit, as profit will naturally follow. Sprinklr became profitable too early, resulting in revenue growth of about 6%, but the company is currently struggling. Sprout, on the other hand, has experienced double-digit revenue growth and is poised for even greater success as it shifts towards serving upmarket and larger customers, like Honda and NASCAR. Trust me, profits will follow.

- „High SBC“. Yes, this is true, and I don’t like it either. As far as I know, in 2023, they offered their employees SBC. However, at least SBC didn’t increase last year and instead remained flat. Nevertheless, SBC is high, and I don’t like it either. Without it, they would already be profitable. What’s important to me is that they are operational profitable, even though they are not GAAP-based. GAAP-based profit will follow.",0,16,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqlo50/spt_sprout_social_no_one_talks_about_it_and_i/,new,Unknown,0.38

1nqfbgz,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 14:57:19,Why do we insist on CRP when there is none?,"Let me use Turkey as an example.

There’s this idea that investors should require an extra risk premium when they invest outside the US. Sure, we can debate the whole “US exceptionalism” thing, but leaving that aside…

According to CAPM, you shouldn’t get compensated for risks you can diversify away. For instance, most European markets are pretty tightly correlated with the global market. So, no matter how much you diversify, you’re still basically exposed to the same risks.

Turkey, though, is different. Since the 2018 shift to the presidential system, its correlation with the MSCI World Index has been just 0.36, with an R² of 0.13. That’s really low. It basically means Turkey doesn’t move with world markets, so if you diversify, you can actually wash out most of its country-specific risks.

So my question is: why do we still tack on an extra risk premium for Turkey?

And here’s a bonus thought: Turkey’s equity risk premium has been close to zero, or even negative, whether you look from 2000 or from 2018. So investors might want an extra return for the risk, but the market itself doesn’t actually provide it. At the end of the day, your opportunity cost is what the real market gives you, and in Turkey’s case, that “extra risk” doesn’t translate into extra return.

1nqcnct,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 13:15:48,Is Auto-Investing in P2P lending a viable option?,"I’ve been exploring ways to diversify my investment strategy and read about the concept of auto-investing in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending on [https://lendermarket.com/lendermarket-risk-rating/](https://lendermarket.com/lendermarket-risk-rating/) . Essentially, P2P platforms allow you to automatically invest in consumer loans based on predefined criteria such as loan terms, interest rates, and risk ratings.

One of the key attractions of these platforms is the potential for relatively high returns. Many P2P lending platforms offer average annual returns in the range of 15-18%. While these returns can be appealing, they typically come with a higher risk profile compared to traditional investments, which is something to carefully consider.

To manage risk, many P2P lending platforms offer risk rating systems to evaluate loan originators. These ratings consider factors such as financial stability, legal structure, and transparency. By investing in loans with lower-risk originators, you can reduce the likelihood of defaults, though higher returns often come with higher risk.

A notable feature is the buyback guarantee offered by some platforms. If a loan becomes overdue for a certain period, the platform’s originator repurchases the loan, ensuring the principal and accrued interest are returned to the investor. This buyback provision can offer some peace of mind, but it’s essential to remember that there’s still a risk of delays or defaults, especially in cases where loans are extended multiple times.

Another consideration is the lack of liquidity in most P2P lending platforms. Unlike stocks or mutual funds, you can't sell your investments before they mature unless a secondary market is available. This means that your capital could be tied up for a significant period, potentially reducing flexibility in case you need to access funds quickly.

I’m curious if anyone here has experience using auto-investing in P2P lending. What has been your experience in terms of returns, risk management, and overall performance? Any thoughts on balancing risk and return when using such platforms?",0,2,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqcnct/is_autoinvesting_in_p2p_lending_a_viable_option/,new,Unknown,0.17

If such a scenario plays out, the market implications could be huge especially for energy.

Oil & Gas: Russia remains a major supplier globally despite sanctions. A credible peace push could ease fears of supply disruptions and potentially bring more Russian crude/natural gas back into legitimate global channels. On the flip side, if escalation happens before talks, we could see another spike in Brent/WTI.

Europe: European natural gas prices have been extremely sensitive to the war. A genuine move toward peace could stabilize or even depress prices, but if the path is rocky, volatility might remain high. LNG exporters in the U.S. (LNG, CQP) could be impacted if Europe shifts away from emergency buying.

Energy Stocks: Majors like XOM, CVX, Shell, BP might see headwinds if peace reduces the risk premium baked into energy markets. On the other hand, stability could boost refining margins and long-term demand planning.

Broader Commodities: If peace looks real, agricultural and fertilizer markets might calm (Ukraine/Russia being key wheat & potash exporters).

1npzzyt,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 03:03:11,"Why is a 2% mortgage a ""great"" business for a bank when other investments seem way better?","I'm having trouble understanding the logic of why a bank would lend someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for a 30-year mortgage at a very low interest rate (say, 2%). As an individual investor, this seems like a terrible return, especially when safer assets like government bonds sometimes offer even higher yields.



I've heard all the simple answers, but none of them seem to fully hold up. My doubts are:



\- The ""Spread"" Argument: People say banks profit on the spread between the interest they pay on deposits and the interest they earn on the loan. But I understand banks create money when they lend, not just lend out existing deposits. So why create money for a low-return mortgage instead of for something more profitable?



\- The ""Low-Risk"" Argument: The loan is secured by a house, making it low-risk. But there have been times when long-term government bonds were both safer and had a higher yield than mortgages. Yet banks kept issuing mortgages. This can't be the only reason.



\- The ""It's the Law"" Argument: The final answer I get is that banks are legally forbidden from creating money to buy bonds? Okay, but that feels like a circular argument. It doesn't explain why the entire financial and regulatory system is seemingly built to make mortgages the absolute best, most profitable thing a bank can do with its unique power to create credit???



I feel like the real answer involves something deeper. Can anyone explain the real, non-simplified rationale here?",191,391,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npzzyt/why_is_a_2_mortgage_a_great_business_for_a_bank/,new,Unknown,0.79

1npncdh,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 16:38:02,Be careful with quantum stocks,"I'm an engineer, and my sphere of competence is technology. I'm a believer in quantum computers. Here's why I think it's a bad idea to invest in quantum stocks.

You see, a successful business is not determined by how advanced the technology is, but by its ability to generate a pile of money. Business, first of all, is a cash generator. And we, as investors, want to own great cash generators. The problem with quantum stocks is that none of them are great businesses (aside from maybe IBM and Google, which aren't really ""quantum stocks"").

Let's put aside the complexity of quantum computing and how difficult it is to scale. Let's assume we've solved all technical issues. Do you know how much it costs to build and maintain a quantum solution? Do you know how much it would cost to develop commercialized mass-manufacturing? To educate the personnel? The answer: a freaking unimaginable amount.
  
There's no company in Taiwan that will print you quantum chips on demand. There aren't millions of quantum engineers and software programmers waiting to be employed. The infrastructure does not exist. Quantum technology won't be scalable for decades - maybe half a century.
  
You can't even compare quantum to the AI revolution. AI is still silicon-based and can reuse existing infrastructure. Quantum technology reimagines our entire approach to computing from scratch. And it costs a hell of a lot of money (tons of debt, none of profit).

None of the companies on the market will dominate the quantum space. They're not businesses - they're research labs (and some are scams). The companies that will eventually build infrastructure, hire engineers, and scale to the market don't exist yet.

Technology doesn't mean business. Research doesn't mean cash. And sadly, even established companies with fully built infrastructure and strong brands can fail as businesses (sorry, Intel, I'm talking about you).

See how absurd it is that current quantum stocks already have billions in market cap, sitting alongside successful businesses? These companies print flashy news releases and talk big about how quantum will change everything. They exploit public ignorance about technology to sell wet dreams stuffed with money bags. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Your money will soon end up in the pockets of insiders and hedge funds.

This is a reality check not just for quantum stocks, but for tech hype in general. Think twice where you put your money. Maybe it's better to take your profit, consider yourself lucky, and buy your girlfriend flowers or a house?

Not investment advice, of course, but I'd rather put a smile on a girl's face than invest in quantum. ;)

P.S.
When in doubt, trust fundamentals, not your biases. Don't fool yourself into thinking you would've picked Nvidia in 2015 if you only had the information available in 2015. Today is the same - you don't know who's going to be the champ in 2035. It will surprise us all.

1npm4f4,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 15:50:49,Is Celestica (CLS) the quiet “picks & shovels” winner of the AI build-out?,"Seven weeks ago Celestica (CLS) hit the $253 price target I’d set. Since then, the stock has kept climbing, and, more importantly, the fundamentals have strengthened. This isn’t just another contract manufacturer anymore; it’s becoming one of the key suppliers enabling the AI infrastructure boom.



The CCS segment grew 28% y/y in Q2 2025. Its HPS revenue surged 82% y/y, lifting margins and returns. These numbers are being driven by the transition from 400G to 800G network switches, the high-speed plumbing that connects massive GPU clusters. Every major hyperscaler is now ramping 800G programs, and Celestica already has design wins for 1.6T switching racks scheduled to start in 2026.



You can add more GPUs to a cluster, but if the links between them are slow, training times don’t improve. Doubling network speed from 400G to 800G (and soon 1.6T) removes that bottleneck. Celestica spotted this shift early and is now one of the go-to suppliers for ultra-fast switches and racks.



The macro backdrop is also reinforcing the thesis. Nvidia and OpenAI just announced a plan to deploy 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA AI systems for OpenAI’s next-generation infrastructure and Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI to make it happen. Oracle has committed a staggering $300 billion to host OpenAI’s future workloads. All of that AI compute has to live somewhere, connected by somebody’s hardware. Celestica sits in the middle of that supply chain, quietly making the high-speed gear that keeps the AI arms race running.



I’ve raised my fair value estimate for Celestica to $320 per share, up from $253. That’s based on higher CCS growth assumptions (35% instead of 27% in 2025) and a slightly lower cost of capital as visibility and margins improve. The upside comes with risks (concentrated customers and potential capex pauses) but the long-term compounding story is intact.",13,8,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npm4f4/is_celestica_cls_the_quiet_picks_shovels_winner/,new,Unknown,0.67

Before, I was investing more unconventionally through real estate, but better late to the Roth retirement account then never.

I came up with a Roth IRA portfolio of: 50% VTI 20% VXUS 15% VGT and 15% QQQM.  

I've gotten some feedback from that post and have a new split of  50% SPMO 20% XMMO 15% VGT and 15% QQQM.  

Now I was looking for feedback on my brokerage account.  Currently it's comprised of individual stocks that I've just bought and been holding.  It's done quite well recently, up 110% since 2022 but I'm well aware that you could have pretty much picked any stock and made money the past few years.

  
So that leads me to this post, I want to add more stability and start reallocating and distributing my funds differently, mainly adding some ETFs to it.  So this is what I came up with to balance and not overlap the Roth.  

35% VTI 20% SMH 20% SCHD 15% ARKK and 10% to explore ie individual picks.

  
currently my 401k is primarily VOO.

  
Does this seem like a sound strategy, diversification? Any and all feedback welcome and thank you in advance.",2,5,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npk9m5/looking_for_feedback_on_brokerage_allocation/,new,Unknown,0.75

Some of my friends invest heavily, some just do the classic “VOO and chill,” and the majority have never cared about investing at all.

Instead of starting with safer, long-term strategies like index funds, they are diving straight into riskier plays such as Chinese markets, emerging markets, and individual stocks.

2) Invested about $6300 into UNH between $275 and $300 a share
* current balance is about $7600 with about $1300 in gain 
3) invested $1k in Open Door to gamble a bit. I’m down like $300, since I entered last week and it’s been dipping. Shares bought in between 8.40 and 10.40 

Feedback is appreciated. I’m aware that I’m not very well diversified, esp in the international market as I have nothing for that. I also know that the mag 7 is driving up s&p 500, so I’m quite heavy in tech at this time

Should I rebalance, or does it like safe enough? I know past performance does not predict future too, meaning that international market could beat USA in the future and I’m heavy in U.S large cap right now. I guess I am in a way chasing performance, but I’m not sure if many people actually would criticize my selection or see it as fine. 

I’m looking to grow as aggressively as possible for the future without basically just gambling.

I can invest this money in exactly the same way as it is in my 401K and still earn this 15 or so percent each year.

Growth is slowing, job gains are slowing, and unemployment is creeping up. Overall, the economy isn't collapsing, but the party is undoubtedly winding down.



Inflation remains a concern. While below the nightmare scenario of 2022, it hasn't yet returned to the Fed's ""dream"" of a 2% target. Core inflation (sticky inflation) remains lingering. Think of it as a guest at a party that refuses to leave.



Interest rates: a little high, a little low. Powell called current rates ""modestly constrained."" In other words: they're not stifling the economy, but they're certainly hindering its rapid growth. The Fed has already cut rates slightly, but he made it clear that future rate cuts are not inevitable. The data will tell.



The risks are two-way. Cut rates too quickly? The inflation monster could reawaken. Keep rates too tight for too long? The job market will suffer. Powell essentially said, ""We're winging it, but we're doing it in a very professional way.""



Stocks are expensive. He actually said the market looks ""quite richly valued."" The Fed Chairman politely told us, “Yes, you paid a high price for those stocks.",328,140,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1noqbel/powell_spoke_today_heres_the_vibe_check/,new,Unknown,0.87

Key sentences: 

* ""Our vision is simple: we want to create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week.""
* ""... it will require innovation at every level of the stack, from chips to power to building to robotics.""
* ""We are particularly excited to build a lot of this in the US; right now, other countries are building things like chips fabs and new energy production much faster than we are, and we want to help turn that tide.""
* ""Over the next couple of months, we’ll be talking about some of our plans and the partners we are working with to make this a reality.""

Any guesses on who they'll partner with mainly? I'm not super into the end-to-end AI infra space but here's what our good friend ChatGPT says are the main areas:

* **Energy generation & supply:** To scale to gigawatt-per-week growth, you need lots of cheap, reliable, low-carbon or zero-carbon power. Also, grid/interconnection infrastructure must handle large loads.
* **Chips / accelerators / custom hardware:** GPUs, TPUs, ASICs, other accelerators for training & inference.
* **Data center / facility design:** Physical buildings, racks, layout, power distribution, mechanical infrastructure (cooling, ventilation), modularity, robotics for construction etc.
* **Cooling / thermal management & power delivery:**  GPUs and accelerators produce lots of heat; cooling strategies (air, liquid, immersion) become critical.
* **Networking & storage / I/O / data movement:** Training large models involves moving large volumes of data between storage, compute, between datacenters, etc. Inference also has latency requirements, so networking bandwidth, latency, storage speed matter.
* **Supply chain and manufacturing:** Everything needs to be manufactured at scale. Also packaging, testing, transport.
* **Software, orchestration, tools:** Software stack to manage hardware: scheduling of training/inference, utilization, monitoring, fault tolerance, optimizing for power, usage, etc. Also tools for model evaluation & selection, efficiency, etc.
* **Regulation, environment, sustainability:** Ensuring that scaling doesn’t blow up carbon emissions, water usage; environmental permitting; policy around energy usage; ensuring power grid stability; social/environmental impact of building huge facilities.

**Who are the top contenders in each area in your opinion?**

I imagine it has to be a company that has appetite for experimentation/innovation. I imagine some will be private cos. ",46,35,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nomhws/sam_altmans_new_blog_post_who_are_the_infra/,new,Unknown,0.82

Cash Flow seems more a transparent metric and less manipulated with accruals and so on by the companies when comparing to ROE and others  
Do you have the same perspective?

As the title says, I will be transitioning to Fidelity soon based on the advisor fees that I am currently paying. The wife and I set this account nearly 30 yrs ago at a time when we didn't know anything and the ability to trade and manage your money was a lot more cumbersome.  Over that time our two ROTHS have grown and are now at $500k (total)) which puts our yearly management fees at just under 5K.  I am kind of embarrassed that I let this go for so long but now I want to transition out of managed accounts and into something where we do all of the managing.

The funds within each of our current ROTH's have a decent mixture of bonds, REIT's and other assets but I feel that it could be better and now that I will be going to Fidelity, it opens up access to many more funds.  I'm looking for advise as to what those funds should be

Currently, each ROTH account contains - FEPIX, LLDYX, MXFIX, COST, MSFT, QQQ, SLV, IVE, IJH, ICF, IJR and VEU

Some more background might help as well -

The wife and I have 3 more years of work.. We have 75K in a HYSA and all our monthly expense, once we stop working at 60, will be covered by my military pension and disability rating. Our military health care covers us until we hit Medicare age. We also have (2) 401ks @ \~ 600k total so the ROTH money will remain largely untouched for at least the next 10-15 yrs.

From what I've seen and heard, Nvidia is solidifying its position, and Oracle is becoming a huge player in the AI cloud.

1) The Nvidia-OpenAI deal is massive, with a commitment of up to $100 billion. It feels like Nvidia is locking in its biggest customer and ensuring its dominance.

2) The Nvidia-Intel partnership, with a $5 billion stock investment, seems like a smart way to de-risk Nvidia's supply chain and give Intel a direct line into the AI space.

3) I've also heard that Oracle is becoming a central player in the AI cloud, securing key contracts and positioning itself for massive growth.

All this new, energy-intensive infrastructure for ""AI factories"" is going to put a huge strain on global energy grids and supply chains. It feels like there are new investment opportunities and risks popping up everywhere.

1no8ea2,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 00:48:49,50RR Trade called out this weekend... Did you miss it? A perfect setup brought to you by Trend Analysis,"Hi all, Chartstradamus here.  I wanted to highlight a trade I called out both in this weekends update and yesterdays daily update. (For proof image 2, or my post history)

It is the 3rd of the 3 setups I trade, I've done some previous updates highlighting the other 2 over the past month.

This setup is a breakout strategy on the failure of an established trend.  On the break of the trend structure I will enter heavy on a retest and generally an impulse leg should bring us to the target zone of the over-riding trend.

For reference the Purple 15m bear structure was established and unchanged on my chart from middle of last week.  

The Blue 1H bull structure was established weeks ago and has remain unchanged as well.

The setup played out perfectly, with a clean test, break, and retest of the breakout line (circled in the 1st image) and a strong impulse toward the target area (the dotted blue line).

This is how good TA works, I am not necessarily predicting something is going to happen.  As I stated in yesterdays update I was actually short going into the day.  

I am just identifying inflection points in the market ahead of time, and depending how the market reacts to those areas plotting a trade from there. 

Wth extended targets and stops outside of structure that if they were to hit I would be sure of a directional change.

I'm up over 10k in profits more than doubling my account in under a month during this forward test. 

I hope some of you who have been following from the beginning were able to capitalize on this trade as well.  I appreciate all of you.

1no662i,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 22:50:08,Rollover a 403(b) account?,"Hello,

I have a 403(b) account through my old non-profit job called 'The Retirement Plan Company' or 'TRPC.' I started a new job a few months ago, and opted for their pension plan through WA state. My job also has a voluntary investment program through Fidelity that I can contribute to. I don't have much more money to invest outside of my pension right now, but I do have the option to contribute as little as $15/month to their Fidelity program (but I may be able to contribute more as time goes on). I have a separate Fidelity Go account with a little money in it for my daughter's college when she gets older too. 

My question is - should I rollover my TRPC 403(b) to my current employers Fidelity investment program and then contribute $15 a month?

I cannot post the chart (I'll try to put it in the comments), but since Inauguration, the SPY is up 12%, and that is what the president talks about and CNBC gets a hard-on for, BUT the dollar index is down 8% which mitigates most of the gains, barely keeping up with inflation.

Isn't this corroboration that workers with a paycheck got an 8% pay cut since Jan? Maybe that's a bit overstated, but it feels that way. Add to this, longer term interest rates have actually RISEN since the latest 0.25% Fed funds rate cut.  Granted, they had come down in the weeks before in anticipation, but this seems odd.

*Oklo Inc today holds a groundbreaking ceremony at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for its first Aurora powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”*

*“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.*

*The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.*

*“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”*",16,1,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1no05ld/oklo_breaks_ground_on_first_aurora_powerhouse/,new,Unknown,0.71

I was also thinking about using it for a different real estate or other Reg D syndication to give diversification but am a little spooked on those. Note that the taxable brokerage account is already all VOO and VGT and there are IRA accounts having those same, and and also slightly more stock diversification.

1nnytkk,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 17:14:33,My predictions for 2035 -what will be a goldmine and what will be a spectacular collapse,"
**1. Corporate jobs, white-collar, office jobs, working for corporations** -this has already been revealed as a scam career nobody thinks seriously about since how companies use AI to layoff people.

I would not invest my career path into being a cog in the corporate machine.
Layoffs, optimizing quarterly earnings by offshoring, and AI are taking over.
In my opinion, these jobs are too risky. The ultimate goal of corporations is to cut costs on employees, pay them as little as possible while keeping them from quitting, and maintain a constant large supply of workers (including migrants) to create endless competition and an employer’s market.

It’s very risky to invest in corporate jobs. I would stay away, even if today tech, finance, etc. offer good salarie because your job existence depends on whether the corporation wants you or not. It’s a pointless career in the era of AI.

**2. Independent career paths**

Jobs and professions where your clients are ordinary people and you control how much you work and who you work for. Dentists, nurses, hairdressers, car mechanics, builders, plumbers.
Services you provide directly to ordinary people, work independent from boss and managers.

**3. Small business owners**
Again, independent jobs outside the traditional 9-5 corporate slavery, without bullshit like time tracking and annual performance reviews. Local pizzerias, restaurants, beauty salons, electronic shops, food shops, etc.

**4. Marketing and influencing**

Having a large following userbase, being public and visible on the internet, building a community, being a YouTuber,  with 100k+ subscribers.
Why? Because it allows you to leverage that audience to create businesses you already have a ready user base.

**5. Innovations against capitalism and corporate culture**

Since the job market is terrible and will be even worse in the future, all innovation around fighting consumerism, anti-capitalism, and small alternatives (to McDonald’s, Amazon, Facebook etc.) will grow. 20 years ago, these companies were liked by people because they were innovative and helped improve people’s lives. Now they hoard all the profits for themselves and harm society, the economy, and the job market. People hate large companies now, and they will be seeking friendly, ethical, anticapitalistic alternatives who share profits with ordinary people and make their life better.

In the future, angry people who lost their jobs due to AI will also move away from large corporations. Just like iPhones will become outdated the way BlackBerry phones did, alternatives to Amazon and other corporate giants will emerge.

The next trend is anticonsumerism. All innovations that provide alternatives to AI, big corporations, and consumerism will grow. This is especially visible in Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Being poor and frugal will be cool. A few years ago, people admired influencers and celebrities now they hate them for flaunting luxury lives they’ll never have.

Previously, wearing Louis Vitton and rolex was considered impressive, but now people laugh at that. Wearing Temu clothes is seen as cooler because everyone knows buying overpriced products is for losers. Among the younger generation, wearing Louis vitton or riding a porsche isn’t a flex anymore, it’s cringe. People despise these status symbols, seeing them as losers tricked into buying overpriced corporate bullshit that’s worth $1 instead of the $10 000 they paid.

**6. Loneliness epidemic**

This is a huge problem. Right now people replace their social contact with tiktok and social media, but even though they use it, they still crave real human connections. Anything, businesses or innovations that solves this problem and unites the younger generation could be the next airbnb level innovation.

**7. Squeezing money from services for the middle class and rich**

All the work and services where the rich are consumers will provide a lot of money. Cleaning their houses, quality food for the wealthy, nannies, spas, luxury brands, etc. Prices for services targeting the rich will rise.
Just like corporations raise prices for products while cutting labor costs, people providing direct services for the rich (cleaning ladies, nannies, food delivery, spas, etc.) will raise their rates, squeezing money from the rich. People hate the rich and will overvalue these services as a way to get money back. 

**8. Investing in stocks**

I believe the UBI of our time will be investing in stocks guaranteed profit in the era of AI. On one hand, we can hate AI as corporate robbery used to lay off people. But on the other hand, we can ride the wave and invest in their stocks.

The recession isn’t coming in the next 10 years, corporations have everything in place now. The poor will struggle, but the capital market doesn’t care. Capital markets exist to make money.

Investing, especially in AI companies, is a safe bet. Ordinary people may dislike AI, but billionaires are already pouring money into it and will continue to. Large cap stocks at this point are like a safe UBI with 20-30% YoY gains.

What do the rich do if they want more money? They invest in stocks. Years ago, the stock market saw recessions, 20% drops, Black Mondays, banking crises, etc. Now the stock market doesn’t even react to that. The rich pour their money into stocks because they’re too lazy to create something new with real value they just click, buy stocks, and do nothing while their capital multiplies.

1nnyjfw,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 17:03:27,Should We Trust AI With Our Investments Researches?,"There has always been debate on how much trust to place in AI when it comes to investing. The benefits are easy to notice. It can process massive amounts of data faster than any individual, scanning price action, news, sentiment, and even onchain flows in real time. It also takes emotions out of the equation, offering signals that are more structured and less tied to fear or greed. For investors who want speed and efficiency, it feels like having an assistant that never sleeps.  
  
But there are also clear drawbacks. It is built on patterns and past data, which means it cannot fully predict sudden shocks, unexpected changes in sentiment, or events that can move markets overnight. It can also make traders overconfident if they begin to trust it too much, forgetting that markets are still shaped by human behavior and unpredictability. Another concern is that if too many people use similar tools, trades might become crowded, reducing the edge that individuals are looking for.  
  
These pros and cons make me think more carefully about how it could fit into my own investing approach. because I usually rely on bitget for my digital investments, but with the platform now upgraded into a Universal Exchange that combines crypto, futures, and even tokenized stocks in one place, the idea of using it there is becoming more tempting. I see how something like GetAgent could reduce the amount of manual research I do by pulling real-time prices, tracking smart money movements, and reading sentiment in one screen instead of many.  
  
The real question for me is whether I should actually bring it into my routine or just keep it as an optional tool. Should it remain a supportive layer in the background, or is it worth giving it a higher level of trust in making decisions? I have not yet committed to it because I want to weigh these points carefully. It feels like the future of investing is moving in this direction, but I am still curious to hear whether others think it should guide decisions directly or simply provide data that we interpret on our own.",0,6,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnyjfw/should_we_trust_ai_with_our_investments_researches/,new,Unknown,0.3

1nnti8f,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 13:53:39,Stocks is giving me a better return than crypto.,"I might receive a lot of hate for this but I sold all my crypto weeks ago, was holding cash collecting pennies on stable coins but now full ported into heavy tech, now up 13% in 3 mo, while BTC is slowly dropping and/or dead movement.  

I ditched ETFs a few days ago (SPY/QQQ) because those are safe options and I'm investing in tech with good growth and company financials / fundamentals. 

I've been in crypto since early 2017s and imo BTC isn't an investment anymore, rather a pump n dump. Big corp. has control over it now, the more they have invested the more they have control over it. I knew this in the back of my mind when government slowly took control. The more BTC rises the more money needs to pour into it to get a return. 

Alt coins give you a nice return but I don't want to put in the search effort that can potentially be a dead coin months later. 

Two of my friends in my discord also convinced me to pull from BTC, and there reasoning was, you need a lot of capital to make a % of what the returns were. 

Was also watching a podcast with tucker carlson and his guest said government and big corp want full control of BTC to pump and dump and use buyers liquidly to pay off national debt, take it with a gain of salt.

I looked up how much BTC does on year average says 20%ish - which is very good, except exchanges take a huge cut of your profits. Even had coinbase+ still was losing on it. Switched to kraken instead. During the bull run I made a decent amount then sold for profits but lowkey if I had NVDA/PLTR I would profit off growth/fundamentals instead of an ""agreement"". 

Lastly, my mentor himself who got me introduced to options even said he doesn't touch/hold BTC and hes been invested in the stock market for 10+yrs and made 10M+.

After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

1nnfyrl,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 03:24:22,Why EnSilica is Worth Possibly 13x its Current Price (Updated),"Okay, so you are probably thinking… yeah right, here’s that degenerate Double Bubbler banging on about that penny stock again. Well take a brief moment and read the following to see why my opinion is not so outlandish. You may one day thank me for it.

EnSilica develops custom semiconductor chips called ASICs. Essentially dedicated silicon expertly designed to a particular task such as providing encryption for Internet of Things devices, or efficiently moving data across satellite networks as will hopefully soon be the case with their custom ASIC for AST Space Mobile.

Recently MDA Space acquired a relatively low profile Israeli firm Satixfy for $280m in an all cash offer. Satixfy being a competitor to EnSilica in the ASIC marketplace and high growth satellite communications industry, with 2024 revenue of $20.6m. So that acquisition price is over 13x last year’s revenue!

Compare that with EnSilica’s forecast FY25 revenue (to be confirmed in results anticipated next month) of approximately $25m to $27m as well as a forecast FY26 revenue of between $44m and $47m with ‘80% of FY 2026 revenue already covered by existing customer contracts’ according to EnSilica’s trading update on the London Stock Exchange in April. *Please note I have used the current FX rate to convert figures that were originally quoted by EnSilica in GBP.*

Consider also that another competitor of EnSilica’s is Filtronic who have significant contracts with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Given the importance of Filtronic’s ASICs to SpaceX it has formed a strategic alliance with the firm and acquired 10,949,079 warrants - 5% of the current share capital of Filtronic - which would give SpaceX the opportunity to acquire a notable stake in the firm. Why would it want that? Well in my opinion to ensure they could have a say in the future direction of the firm as well as perhaps giving them the opportunity to create a defensive position to fend off hostile takeovers of Filtronic.

On the subject of Filtronic it is worth considering their forward price-to-sales ratio compared to EnSilica’s. EnSilica trades at a forward PS of just over 1.12 (against the low end of their current FY26 forecast) which compares to Filtronic‘s forward PS of 5.3 according to Simply Wall St data. If EnSilica achieves a similar forward PS as it approaches it’s anticipated medium term sales projection of c.£100 per year (hopefully together with a healthy profit margin) then you could see a market capitalisation of £500m+. That’s 13.44 times the current share price.

Who do I think are likely contenders to acquire EnSilica? Well Qualcomm could be a prime candidate in my opinion. Or another large and diversified semiconductor manufacturer that appreciates and can take advantage of the breadth of EnSilica’s IP, not just the sat comm work but including the post quantum encryption chip, optical networking design IP and automotive radar IP which is being developed in tandem with Radareye following funding from a consortium including Transport for London, IAG and Admiral.

Another possibility is AST Space Mobile, who EnSilica signed a contract with for a high value satellite ASIC in 2021 and which I understand will be a core component within AST’s BlueBird Block 2 satellite constellation scheduled for launch in the coming year or so. I consider AST a possibility as I wouldn’t be surprised that over time they broaden their offering to more fully compete with SpaceX’s Starlink (e.g. higher bandwidth satellite comms with guaranteed quality of service via terminal devices for static and mobile situations). EnSilica has a suite of IP for satellite terminals (a market which is worth billions of dollars) and owning that IP could help AST better compete with Starlink in that scenario.

I can also see U.S. and European companies such as Boeing, Airbus or Thales taking interest, especially given plans for the European Union’s forthcoming IRIS2 constellation. EnSilica’s IP and talent would seemingly be of great benefit to various industry titans in the satellite communications race that is heating up rapidly.

While I would like to see EnSilica grow to become a future British tech champion, I could understand the management accepting an offer of approximately 13x FY26 revenue. With a notable holding myself, I would not complain either.

While EnSilica’s share price fell last week, I still have immense conviction in this promising company and my recent discussion with Chairman Mark Hodgkins has only given me additional confidence in its future long term potential.

Yes, the share price may be turbulent in the times ahead however I may accumulate further should weakness persist (as I did last week) or following what I feel is an unlikely near term event, a rights issue, as is rumoured on ADVFN for example. 

EnSilica is a company I intend to hold for the years ahead given their apparent trajectory as well as potential for being acquired at a significant multiple to its current value.

Is This the End of the Road for AMD or a New Era of Competition?,"seismic event just happened in the semiconductor world, and it has major implications for investors. NVIDIA and Intel announced a historic collaboration, with NVIDIA investing $5 billion in Intel and forming a joint venture to co-develop new chips for AI and personal computing.

This partnership is a big deal because it brings together two of the biggest players in the industry, which immediately sent shockwaves through the market. While Intel's stock saw a massive jump of up to 30%, competitors like AMD saw their shares drop by over 9% in initial trading.

Analysts are now debating the long-term impact on the competitive landscape.

1) For AMD: The concern is that the new partnership could create a powerful, integrated offering that directly challenges AMD's products in both the data center and consumer markets. This move may put pressure on AMD to accelerate its own product launches and strategies.

2) For the Alliance: The deal could be seen as a way for Intel to get a much-needed lifeline and a direct path into the AI space, while NVIDIA gains a massive partner to expand its ecosystem.

What's your take? Is this the beginning of the end for AMD, or will this simply force them to innovate faster and make the market even more competitive?",152,105,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnf3pl/nvidia_and_intel_just_partnered_is_this_the_end/,new,Unknown,0.83

1nnd9am,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 00:40:08,Why Gold Is About to Take a S**t-Ton of Power From the US Dollar,"Source: Interesting video from Bravos Research https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_D5geZvfzs&t=1s&ab_channel=BravosResearch

In summary, they think the value of the US dollar is being repriced against gold, a trend that has happened twice before in history (1970-1980 and 1999-2011), when the dollar lost 90% of its purchasing power against gold. A rise in gold prices often coincides with systemic economic issues and a rising US unemployment rate because a weakening economy prompts the government to lower interest rates and increase spending, which makes the US dollar and Treasury bonds less attractive to investors.

While gold prices are currently rising, the unemployment rate is still low. This is attributed to three reasons:

1/Global Geopolitical Uncertainty: Governments and central banks are diversifying into gold as a safe-haven asset.

2/Devaluing Government Policies: The US government is running a large budget deficit, and the Federal Reserve has been cutting interest rates, which are policies that typically devalue the currency and lead investors to gold.

3/Anticipation of Future Recession: Gold's rise may be in anticipation of a future recession, as consumer confidence is low despite the low unemployment rate.

TLDR: Although stocks may continue to rise in the short term, gold is likely to continue outperforming them.

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley’s are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley’s. When economic conditions are rough, there’s not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn’t be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been heavily declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is “motorcycles are dangerous”.

About half of the AMZN shares have been held over a year so its short term capital tax, the other half last than a year. That doesn't really matter as I would sell ""first in first out"" if I redistributed some of AMZN shares.

1nmnmh3,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 05:34:11,"Late cycle consumer spending shift = downside CMG, SG, etc?","
TL;DR: bearish Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen. Looking for suggestions on similar situations. The devaluation of fast casuals, lululemon feels like a symptom of shifting culture and consumer behaviour. Inflation, portion size shrinking, declining economic activity, consumer fatigue, non existent brand loyalty, and limited scope to rebrand, reinvent, optimize. Late-cycle cultural and consumer-spending shift, where former aspirational brands (fast casual, athleisure, boutique fitness, “accessible luxury”) have gone from status signifiers to punchlines.

Six years ago I visited a Lululemon store for the first time having been familiar with the brand for many years. I knew the brand as a high quality expensive semi boutique level product associated with Soul Cycle, Equinox etc. The store gave a different impression. Some of the clothes were wrinkled and badly presented, customer service was non existent, and they seemed to have no inventory. I assumed it was a one off bad example. But over the following six years I saw the same symptoms again and again and again. Meanwhile, other clues appeared: bigger and bigger sales discounts; diversification into non-sports products with no cohesive direction; a noticeable drop in quality of some garments (I’ve received a few Lululemon gifts down the years). Competitors with cheaper, equally good quality gear eating their market share. 


When I read about $LULU’s demise, I thought “oh course!” (hindsight’s easy, huh?) and began thinking who’s next? While already down bad this year, I can’t help shake the feeling Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen have much more downside risk. The traction gained by the “slop bowl” meme to describe their offerings feels like the Chipotle’s Mr Big dying on a Peloton bike moment. An increasing number of comedians joke about slop bowls and the term “slop bowl” has spiked to four times its previous highs on Google search trends this week. It sounds trivial, but this pervasive content influences our tastes, prompts us to take a look in the mirror at stuff we do on autopilot. I think small rallies / dead cat bounce short covering strength just offer nice entry position opportunities to get short.

With inflation rising sharply, portion sizes shrinking, declining quality of ingredients being masked with higher and higher salt content, these brands need to reinvent in other directions. Trouble is, I don’t know where they can turn. I don’t trust they do either. 

The 2010-19 period brought Netflix, Spotify, fast casual lunch spots with “healthy options” and “fresh ingredients”, it brought Equinox and Soul Cycle and F45 and Amex Platinum lounges to create the illusion for aspirational young professionals that they’ve made it to the top. That illusion is being dismantled. Costs are spiralling, fees are rising, and all these brands and business models feel tired and dare I say a bit embarrassing? These brands were once exciting and pleasing. Aspirational. Now, they feel tired and clichéd. Their complacency isn’t deserving of our money and I think they are heavily exposed to a new wave of disruptors over the coming years.

The 2010-19 era saw consumer spending shift away from luxury goods, cars, Electronics and refocus on travel, food, lifestyle. With more Americans owning passports than ever before and travelling to Europe in record numbers, it might sound silly to claim we’re at a turning point from experience-centric consumer spending, but I truly think we’ve reached saturation point in this cultural cycle. I suspect we’re seeing the beginning of the end of this cycle with no clear path to what the next looks like. 

One thing’s for sure: queueing up every day to buy $20 cardboard bowl of rice, cheese, soggy chicken, greens, some kind of flavored salty liquid labelled as dressing is an undignified experience we will come to laugh at in years to come.",20,6,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nmnmh3/late_cycle_consumer_spending_shift_downside_cmg/,new,Unknown,0.75

So I've been investigating for a few years now, various ETF's, GICs, some stocks,  an TFSA and RRSP but I'm finally starting to see a bit of profit on some of my more ""gambly"" stocks.

It started off with cannabis stocks (I'm Canadian) years ago and I got burnt. Not a huge deal tbh since it was something I considered a bitmof a gamble. But the last year I've actually started to make a bit of profit. 

One for example, a gold mining company is up 84%! The last month it's been hovering around the $30 mark, up from an avg of $17. All indicators and reports I can find are pointing to this being a stable and good buy for the near term.

I'm trying to find guidance on when to sell and when to simply hold for the long term. 

It's not that I need the money right now but it might be nice to pay down some debt or maybe put it onto my mortgage. Or hell even to sell and put the money into a new sub $20 stock and try to grow it from there.

1nm58pv,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 14:09:53,Opening Discussion About RDDT,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.

1nm2vdm,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 12:36:20,$LENZ Therapeutics - VIZZ Eye drop relieves farsightedness for 10 hours and gives most users 20/20 vision.,"
Hello true to my name I have some DD on a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read??” Let’s bring those big Mr scientist science terms to reality.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. For those of you like me with an IQ below your waist size. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you. With Boomers refusing to retire they need this product like a fish needs water.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient that doesn’t effect the muscles around the eye but rather the dilation of the pupil. It creates a pinhole effect that increases vision up close. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•	Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•	Target population of the US is 128 million people - They are currently scaling up for distribution and plan to start full access in October. Few samples and marketing begins now.

	•	A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year.

	•	The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600 depending on many factors.

⸻

Company Financial Health: Strong

	•	Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•	Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•	This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•	They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•	They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•	It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•	The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•	Cramer likes the stock

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter. My position is small and speculative at about 1% my total net worth. However I plan to add more if good news keeps coming out about their scaling and distribution phase.",3,26,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nm2vdm/lenz_therapeutics_vizz_eye_drop_relieves/,new,Unknown,0.56

We will have our Roth contributions and probably rent from a property we will have managed while we are gone. However, we will also need 35k or so liquid in savings, and I’m trying to figure out the best taxable brokerage to use. Since this money won’t go to traditional retirement investments, where can we start parking savings and still get some growth? We bank and have a small investment account with So-Fi. Roths are with Edward Jones (I know, but my husband has the bigger one and likes talking to a guy and our 529 for our kid in college is there and mine could be moved). Vanguard? Another? What is my best play here? We are essentially hoping to geoarbitrage our gap years.

Every month we draw down our account to the 6 month emergency fund with 50% to VTI, 25% to an individual portfolio I manage with individual stocks of varying risk, and 25% straight to a second HYSA (separate from our emergency fund). The second HYSA is because my wife has 0 risk tolerance and I accept that knowing we have cash on the sidelines if there is a huge opportunity from a downturn. 

October is a 3 check month for both of us and my wife changed jobs so we will have a much larger surplus this month with her sign on bonus, PTO payout, and 2 additional pay checks. 

Should we stick to the 50-25-25 plan we have with just more money, take an opportunity to start a new investment (VOO or similar), stash more in cash, YOLO on 0dte calls/puts? What would you do based on the current market conditions?

Let’s say one of your holdings is doing really well, like skyrocketing. But of course, you know it can just as easily drop at the same rate. 

How do you decide if/when to sell and move it into something more stable? Or, do you just hold and say your prayers? 

The stock I am currently pondering is OKLO. It went up 28% yesterday, and all indications are that it will continue to grow now that there is all this attention on nuclear energy. But- nuclear stocks tend to be volatile depending on politics and current events. Not to mention the reality that as soon as anything goes wrong with nuclear production (meltdown, etc) it will likely tank the stock prices and be down a long time. 

Very curious what folks think. TIA. 

Link to OKLO’s site https://oklo.com/overview/default.aspx

*Edit: I’m returning a few days later to say thanks for the advice! I learned a lot. I ended up selling enough of my OKLO shares to cover my original investment and left the rest, am just gonna let it go for now and do what it will do. The intense fluctuations were stressful but now that it’s all just shares generated from profit I am less concerned. 

I’ve been looking into nuclear stocks that feel less risky and speculative. I went with Constellation Energy (CEG) and NuScale (SMR). Both are further along than OKLO, CEG is already building plants for Microsoft and SMR is a startup like OKLO but has federal regulatory approval.

1nltg3d,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 05:12:25,Plot Twist : Good ESG Companies Might Actually Trade Backwards in Emerging Markets,"You know how everyone says futures markets are supposed to lead spot prices because they're more efficient? Well, turns out that might be completely backwards for companies with strong ESG scores in India.

Think about it, if you're tracking a company with stellar environmental and governance practices, you'd expect the usual pattern where futures traders get the info first and spot prices follow. But a recent study analyzing 22 Indian companies across 11 sectors using daily price data shows the opposite happening. For high-ESG companies, the regular stock market is actually leading the futures market.

My take: This could mean one of two things, either the spot market has become incredibly efficient at pricing in ESG information, or there's something fundamentally different about how investors value sustainability in emerging markets compared to the West.

The really wild part? This pattern completely flips for companies with poor ESG scores, where futures do lead spot prices as expected. It's like there are two different pricing universes operating simultaneously.

This has practical implications if you're building ESG-focused portfolios in emerging markets, the traditional technical analysis playbook might not work the way you think.

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I’m doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I’ve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I’ve never had much of a strategy, I’ve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I’ve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in “core” growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in “moonshots” like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. 

The issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max. 

I struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I’m up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there. 

At the same time, it’s becoming almost impossible to manage 33 stocks at once effectively.

I think gold is the best investment in the current market climate with everything going on.

Gold's rise has been astounding recently. It has performed 33% YTD, 45% over the last year, and 80% over last 2 years.

Bull cases for Gold:

1. Rate cuts means more money will be pumped into economy. More money supply will only increase gold's value and devalue the dollar.
2. Current administration is trying to weaken the US Dollar which drives up asset prices, including gold.
3. Inflation remains elevated and current tariffs will only add fuel to inflation.
4. Uncertainty with governments globally are spending money on military.
5. Central banks buying up gold.
6. Central banks and investors have slowed purchasing of US treasuries signaling moving away from US assets.

Cons:
1. Gold does not generate income.
2. Possible that inflation does not accelerate.
3. Gold up already massively over the last 2 years. Investors may dump their profits and buy into other assets.


Maybe I am to much of a doomer millennial, but I don't see this stock market holding up in the medium term. Rate cuts will boost the stock market and we may have a minor pull back or two, but by the end of next year the bubble will deflate. Almost every stock metric is screaming overvalued.

And if the bubble does pop, where will people put their money? Are treasuries still the safe haven? Or has US Debt gotten too out of hand? Will more people pile into gold? Silver? Crypto?

India's regulators just opened up REITs to retail investors and they're getting included in equity indices. This feels like one of those regulatory changes that could actually move the needle.

I'm curious about the timing - this comes right as we're seeing institutional money flow into affordable housing elsewhere (Brookfield's $10B+ manufactured housing deal in the U.S., for example).

I have a stock portfolio, which is performing very well. But I dont have an intention to increase it at the time.

Instead with my spare money I started flat flipping, my return on a flip is between 10 and 30% but realistically it will decrease to 10-12% net a year (market is changing).

My question is: what is your oppinion, it is worth to continue flipping for a 10-12% net percentage, or should I put in on bonds, the yield difference is only 3,5-5,5%. Which I know is significant, but bond require no work, flat flipping requires 20 hours a month.

So what so you think, the 3,5-5,5% is worth the 20 hours and headaches, or should I put this time to focus on other things, and just sit on bonds?

To calculate how much retirement savings we will need to maintain a certain budget without our nest-egg ever going down requires some data.  I used to think my investments get a certain rate of return, then they will generate enough income to match or exceed my spending, but then I started thinking about inflation, and how that will impact the AMOUNT of money I need to maintain the lifestyle.

Is it accurate to say that if you subtract inflation from the rate of return, that the difference is sufficient for that calculation?

Example (with fake numbers).   If I wanted to retire with $50k of investment income, and didn't want to spend down my nest egg, I would only need to know two things.  How much savings and at what differential between returns and inflation?   If I wanted $50k, if I had a million dollars and returns were averaging 7%, inflation was averaging 3%, the differential would be 4%, I'd be getting $40k of income.   ($10k short of my goal, so I really need $1.25M)

As I type this, I think it's still wrong, because $40k today is worth more than $40k in 10 years, and it has more spending power now than it will then.

The survivor SS benefits almost covers basic expenses, (almost). I would still need a few grand from investments just to cover everything. That's the basics.

Soon after that I will switch to my full SS benefit that should more than cover expenses plus a moderate surplus. One goal is to draw as little as possible  from investment, letting it grow until my FRA at 67 (perhaps even 65) I have a high equity allocation because the early retirement left me with less savings then I had hoped.

What is my risk here? Is a lower equity allocation at the start of retirement all physiological to alleviate stress during downturns?How much real risk do I have.

One of the core benefits here is also the fact that the fees are minimal, transactions are instant and its completely independent of VISA/Mastercard networks.

Brazil apparently also has something similar called Pix 

Apparently there's more similar systems popping up in many countries, both utilizing Central banks and operating via QR codes, independent of the american visa/mastercard payment networks, not only are they simple to use, they are purely digital and convenient. 

The most important evidence of their value though is the fact that Murica has attacked both systems, calling[ Qris a 'trade barrier](https://windonesia.com/article/us-cites-qris-as-trade-barrier-but-us-payment-model-unfit-for-indonesia)' or[ Pix 'unfair to Murican companies'](https://paymentexpert.com/2025/07/22/us-investigation-brazil-pix-payment-system/)

This to me signals that those systems are an active threat since after all, them taking over the market means American payment processors like Visa and mastercard will be losing a lot of power and relevance. And people are also politically motivated to find alternatives due to all the censorship those payment networks are pushing for.

Those systems are cheaper, convenient and independent of american payment networks, this kinda suggests that their takeover is inevitable and eventually the visa/mastercard wont be as relevant.

Back in the late 90s/early 2000s, there was active following on Investor Village on the Rambus thread with handles like Watzman, CroakerFrog, ScruffyNYC, and many others.  After Intel designated RDRAM the sole memory for their new Pentium chip, Rambus skyrocketed and briefly traded above 100 in early 2000.  However, RDRAM was poorly received by both consumers and memory makers due to cost and some technical issues and resistance from the memory makers.

After a series of legal setbacks, failing to win infringement claims, losing an anti-trust lawsuit, and having to face a politically motivated FTC investigation, the stock price crashed and traded in the single digits.

Let's say you were gainfully employed at a high paying job and maximized your 23.5k contribution half way through the year.

Then, you take out a 401k loan with a 8% interest rate that you pay back to yourself...

According to Empower, the 401k loan does not result in your funds being taken out of the market - it just adds the debt.

Doesn't this allow you to contribute more than the max contribution into your 401k? The origination fee for the 401k loan at Empower is only 50 dollars...

Paying the loan plus interest back into the account would theoretically allow you to exceed 23.5k in total contributions since the loan interest does not count against the limit",20,40,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nkk2xz/front_loading_401k_contributions_then_401k_loan/,new,Unknown,0.67

They’re really pushing me to move the money into an inherited IRA with them. I know I have to empty it within 10 years since I’m a non-spouse, but I can’t tell if this is actually the best move or just more money for them.

The 401(k) has super low fees (like 0.08%–0.16%). If I roll into Merrill’s inherited IRA, I feel like I’ll end up paying higher fees and service charges. At the same time, I get that an IRA might give me more control.

Has anyone else been through this? Did you leave it in the company 401(k) or switch to an inherited IRA (and if so, did you stick with Merrill or move to somewhere cheaper like Vanguard/Fidelity)? I just don’t want to get steered into something that’s worse for me long-term.

Currently, I am 57 and will stop working when I'm 60. I have two 401k's (one active and one from an old job) that should have a combined value of about 750k when I stop working.  I am looking at making things as easy as possible for my wife when I'm no longer around and while she currently doesn't take an very active role in our retirement planning that will change here in a couple years.

Right now the two 401ks have a variety of funds within them. The older one is a Gov TSP with C, S and I funds, while my active 401k is mainly Large Cap and Small/Mid Cap ETF's.  Do you think it would be ""easier"" for her in the future to have all our pre-tax money in a single account, spread across a couple stable ETF's vice how it is now?  Also, having never done anything like this before, is it a pretty simple process to transfer 401k balances into an IRA?   

Lastly, I assume that I cant simply bring over the same particular ETF's that I currently use since they are ""company managed"" (not sure if that's the correct terminology)  so would i just liquidate all the funds into cash and then transfer the balance into the IRA and go from there?

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story.

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.

It’s all cashiers checks that she refuses to cash and deposit into the bank. Might be something left over from a divorce way back or bankruptcy. Either way, I’ve tried telling her that she’s lost nearly 10% of her cashes spending value this year alone. Invest in SOMETHING at least. She says, “ I need a place to live but I can’t afford one”. Boy will she be shocked when prices rise again and stay elevated… With the rate cuts current and planned, I can foresee even more sticky inflation in our futures. That being said, I’m a casual investor with only my limited experience these past 10yrs. 
My questions are as follows:

1- How do I effectively simplify and explain these current events and how they affect her and her savings. Now and in the future.

2-What is the general consensus on a relatively safe investment with liquidity in approx 2-5yrs? Normally in this situation with her age I wouldn’t recommend stocks. Too volatile even the “safer” bets to guarantee her investments safety in a time frame she could access it. Shoot I’m young enough I’d be riding this thing out but she’s not. Then there’s silver and gold. Both at almost all time highs. That was my first knee jerk reaction but again. Would hate to have her invest in a top of which I couldn’t help her with. Still, with inflationary pressures I think for it’s mobility and stability I think she should stack gold. If she’s not going to invest it through normal channels. 

My family historically hasn’t been the best with money/investments. Best bet would to find a good financial advisor but see previous sentence…I just worry that her fear of making a move will hurt her more than actually doing something to combat this.

1njurb9,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 21:03:54,Why Palantir (PLTR) Is a Strong Buy in 2025,"Palantir Technologies has been a standout performer in 2025, soaring significantly year-to-date on the strength of impressive earnings, AI-driven momentum, and major government contracts. Despite concerns about its high valuation, is this a tech bubble or a justified winner? The evidence suggests Palantir is capitalizing on AI with disciplined growth, profitability, and a strategic edge few competitors can match. Here's why Palantir is a strong buy for 2025, addressing bearish concerns and showing why they fall short.

Palantir's financials demonstrate a rare blend of rapid growth and profitability. First-quarter revenue showed strong year-over-year growth, followed by a record-breaking second quarter, particularly in the U.S. with commercial revenue surging. Full-year revenue for 2024 was robust, but 2025 is accelerating further. Unlike many high-growth tech firms, Palantir is profitable under standard accounting, with a notable net income increase in the second quarter and high operating margins. Cash flow is equally impressive, with significant free cash flow growth, far outpacing peers who often burn cash. Management has raised full-year revenue guidance, signaling confidence in sustained momentum. This combination of growth and financial discipline sets Palantir apart.

The core of Palantir's success lies in its AI Platform, which allows clients to run advanced AI models securely on private data, delivering insights for industries like supply chains, finance, healthcare, and defense. Strategic partnerships amplify this advantage. A groundbreaking collaboration with Microsoft integrates Azure's AI capabilities with Palantir's platform in classified defense environments, described by CTO Shyam Sankar as a major leap forward. Palantir also works with OpenAI and partners on responsible AI with Anthropic and Google. These partnerships are driving real contracts, such as deals with Fannie Mae for fraud detection, NATO for defense intelligence, and various U.S. federal agencies. Palantir's platforms, including Foundry for enterprises, Gotham for government, and Apollo for deployment, are proven and reliable. CEO Alex Karp is using AI internally to boost efficiency, aiming to multiply revenue with a lean workforce, showcasing a commitment to operational excellence.

Palantir's contract portfolio is a cornerstone of its strength, blending long-term government deals with a rapidly growing commercial business. A major U.S. Army agreement signed in mid-2025 consolidates numerous contracts into a multi-billion-dollar framework, praised by Army leadership as a step toward modernization. Additional defense and federal contracts, including classified programs, solidify Palantir's government presence. Meanwhile, U.S. commercial revenue is growing explosively, with a robust pipeline of high-value deals across finance, pharma, and energy sectors, where data security is critical. This balance of government and commercial contracts ensures a steady stream of recurring revenue.

Leadership is a key driver of Palantir's success. Alex Karp, with his bold vision of an AI-driven ""efficient revolution,"" is targeting massive revenue growth with a smaller team. The second quarter was described as phenomenal, with the company exceeding expectations and raising guidance. Founders and executives hold significant stakes, aligning with shareholders, and Karp's control allows a focus on long-term innovation over short-term market pressures. With a strong cash position and minimal debt, Palantir can fund research and weather market fluctuations, maintaining lean operations with high margins.

Compared to peers, Palantir shines. Against data and AI firms like Snowflake, Palantir combines faster growth with profitability, while Snowflake remains unprofitable. [C3.ai](http://C3.ai) shows promise but lacks Palantir's scale and margins. Traditional defense contractors dominate hardware, but Palantir's software and AI focus carves out a unique niche. Big Tech offers cloud services, but Palantir's specialized AI workflows, often in partnership with firms like Microsoft, fill a distinct gap. Karp argues that advanced AI models need Palantir to function effectively in real-world applications.

Skeptics raise valid points. Palantir's valuation, with high price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios, suggests risk if execution falters. However, its rapid growth, consistent outperformance, and major contracts support a premium. Government revenue concentration is a concern, but bipartisan support for AI and defense, along with multi-year deals, reduces risk, while commercial growth diversifies the business. International revenue has been flat, but Palantir's focus on the U.S. market is driving results, with global defense wins adding upside. AI hype could fade, but Palantir's practical applications, from logistics to fraud detection, and strong industry partnerships ensure staying power. Insider selling and Karp's unconventional style raise eyebrows, but significant founder ownership and a long-term focus outweigh these concerns.

Palantir is a leader in AI-driven analytics for critical applications, with strong growth, high margins, and a fortified position in government and enterprise markets. Karp's vision of efficiency is delivering, with quarterly revenue surpassing key milestones. Despite its rally, the market may underestimate Palantir's long-term contracts and commercial expansion. In a world where data is king, Palantir is a leading force. This is a strong buy for 2025.

One of the main risks flagged by Moody's involved the ""counterparty risk"" of Oracle relying on large commitments from a small number of AI companies to fund its business model.""

Counterparty risk is always a key consideration in any type of project financing, particularly where there is a high reliance on revenue from a single counterparty,"" Moody's analysts wrote on Wednesday.""And in our view, Oracle’s data center build is effectively one of, if not the world’s largest, project financing,"" they added.

The analysts further noted the company will see its debt increase faster than its EBITDA, which will contribute to a forecast high leverage of 4x before Oracle's EBITDA begins to outpace its debt.""It is likely that free cash flow will also be negative for an extended period before reaching breakeven,"" the analysts wrote.

Oracle had a Moody's issuer rating of Baa2, which is at the lower end of investment-grade credit ratings.

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (LXRX) is currently trading around **$1.08**, and from what I’m seeing, it looks like they might finally be getting their act together. Here’s a quick breakdown:

* **Pipeline & Partnerships:** Their experimental obesity drug (LX9851) has a **partnership with Novo Nordisk** worth up to **$1 billion in milestone payments** with $75M upfront. That’s a huge vote of confidence from a major pharma player.
* **Products Ready for Market:** They still have sotagliflozin (INPEFA®) for heart failure and other metabolic disease candidates. They’ve trimmed commercial operations to focus on **R&D and licensing**, which could mean they’re gearing up to push their promising products to market more efficiently.
* **Price Action:** At $1.08, the stock seems **relatively stable**, suggesting accumulation. For a biotech that’s had its ups and downs, this could be a **setup for a breakout** if upcoming approvals or partnerships play out.
* **Upside Potential:** Analysts have a 12-month price target of **$3.23 on average**, with a range as high as $6.00. If even some of their pipeline works out, that’s a **lot of upside** from the current price.
* **Risks:** Of course, **biotech is always high risk**. Clinical trial outcomes, FDA approvals, or delays could still negatively impact the stock. But with the Novo Nordisk deal and streamlined operations, they seem to have **more runway and credibility** than before.

Fed governor Stephen Miran preferred to cut rates by a half a percentage point and disagreed with the quarter percentage cut.

* **Labor market concerns** with recent job gains have slowed significantly, and the unemployment rate has edged up.
* **Economic slowdown** with indicators suggests economic activity grew at a more moderate pace in the first half of the year.
* **Acknowledged inflation** remains somewhat elevated, but the Fed judged that the rising downside risks to employment warranted a rate cut.

The company’s great, the quarter was record-breaking, but the risk/reward isn’t as compelling. What do you think? Anyone looked at ODC before?","I wanted to share something unusual for me. I tend to hold winners for a long time, but I just closed a position in ODC after a 57% gain in five months (bought at \~$43, sold at $68).

Back in April I did a deep dive on ODC and called it a “quiet compounder” hiding in plain sight ([here](https://www.beatingthetide.com/p/george-atuan-the-dirt-on-a-quiet-compounder-hiding?utm_source=publication-search)). This is the company behind Cat’s Pride litter and a whole bunch of industrial clays. It owns its own clay mines and makes everything from lightweight cat litter to filtration clays used in renewable diesel. 

My thesis then was simple: vertical integration + shift into higher-margin products = rising profitability, but the market hadn’t caught on. 

Earnings had tripled in a few years and the stock was still at single-digit P/E and EV/EBITDA. 

I valued it at $64.

Fast-forward to today. ODC's last earnings were one of the strongest quarters in its 85-year history: Q3 FY2025 revenue $115.5M (+8% y/y), net income $11.6M (+50%), EPS +51%. 

The B2B segment (agricultural carriers + renewable diesel filtration) delivered record sales and margins over 30%. Even with some hiccups in retail cat litter, the overall business is firing on all cylinders.

**B2B Products Group**: Sales +18% to $42.7M, op income +26% to $13.4M (\~31% margin). Ag products hit an all-time high (+43%) as customers worked through last year’s inventories. Fluid purification clays +13% y/y. Even though US renewable diesel production was down 12% early in 2025, ODC’s sales into that sector were up, they’re winning share at new plants. Amlan animal health stayed flat at $5.8M but management is tweaking distribution.

**Retail & Wholesale**: $72.8M sales (+3% y/y) but excluding the Ultra Pet acquisition organic sales were down \~4%. Clay litter fell 6% due to a lost private-label account and some retailer bankruptcies (think regional pet stores closing). Competitors got aggressive on promos. The bright spot is lightweight litter and crystal litter: Cat’s Pride Fresh & Light and the new Cat’s Pride-branded crystals are growing faster than the category. Ultra Pet added \~$4.8M in Q3 sales and ODC has increased the number of retail “doors” for its crystal litter significantly.

Financially, ODC is conservative: cash $36.5M, net debt essentially zero. They’re doubling capex to $32M/year to modernize plants and meet demand. Dividend up 16% (22nd consecutive annual raise). Management thinks in decades, not quarters. The CEO literally said they plan 40 years ahead for raw material reserves.

Industry trends still support them: cat litter demand projected to grow \~5% annually through 2030 with premium subcategories like lightweight and crystals growing faster; renewable diesel capacity in the US keeps expanding and every gallon needs filtration clay; agriculture inputs stable to positive as farm supply inventories normalize.

So why sell? Valuation. 

The “steal” at $43 has been recognized. Multiples moved from <8x earnings to \~13x, EV/EBITDA from <8x to \~11x, P/FCF from 18x to 25x. My updated fair value is $74, so there’s still some upside (\~8%), but the asymmetric risk/reward I look for is gone. I’d rather redeploy the capital into the next underpriced idea than sit on a position where the margin of safety has shrunk.

I’m still a fan of the company and it stays on my watchlist. If Mr. Market throws a tantrum and ODC dips again, I’ll be ready. But for now, discipline > emotion.

So right now 100% of my (small) long term portfolio is invested in QQQ. 

I’m considering diversifying  allocating 10 or 20% of my portfolio either to:

* a gold ETF (**GLD, IAU** or **SGOL**) , or
* a global index ETF, such as **URTH**, **ACWI**, or **VEA**.

I’m concerned that all of these assets look pretty overbought at the moment but the plan is to hold this allocation for a decade.

**Question #1:** What would make more sense:

\- To diversify with gold as a hedge, or 

\- To diversify with a world index ETF to balance exposure across regions and sectors. or 

\- To add more into the QQQ

**Question #2:** Would it be better to wait for a pullback before reallocating?

I’d really appreciate any thoughts or personal experiences.",0,19,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njforb/should_i_diversify_10_of_my_longterm_portfolio/,new,Unknown,0.45

1njdniq,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 09:48:00,Bubble worries have sparked my interest in a particular bond ETF,"I do not believe in timing the market, but when there are major economic trends brewing, I do try to position myself to take advantage of them, which is why I'm plowing a big chunk of my portfolio into TLT right now.

TLT is an ETF for 20+ year bonds. It has a decent yield, but more importantly, it is very sensitive to interest rate changes. The moves can be pretty dramatic. It's down about 50% since the days of ZIRP. You don't usually think about capital gains when investing in bonds, but TLT is uniquely positioned for gains if the Fed continues to reduce rates.

My thesis for this investment is that we are either stuck in stagflation or we are on the verge of a recession. If we're in stagflation, the yield from TLT will outperform the S&P 500. If we're in a recession, the fed will likely continue to lower interest rates, and TLT will deliver capital gains on top of a yield.

The obvious risk is that we are actually entering a period of sticky inflation and the job market recovers, in which case the Fed will raise interest rates. But this seems like the least likely scenario. Tariffs are expected to create transitory inflation and everywhere you turn there is weak jobs data.

Unless you think I'm underestimating the risk of sticky inflation?",0,8,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njdniq/bubble_worries_have_sparked_my_interest_in_a/,new,Unknown,0.35

I’ve been following ACHR for almost a year, but I haven’t added more shares recently because the stock seems a bit volatile despite all the developments.

I’ve done a lot of DD on them and I like their tech and long term vision, but some circumstances have changed over the past few months that make me cautious.

They’re making moves into the defense and military space, with partnerships like Anduril, trademarks like Monarch, Giraffa, and Mothra & property acquisitions near defense partners. They’re also set for upcoming events like the Dubai AirShow and potential operations in Abu Dhabi. These moves could create serious upside if executed well

https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/archer-aviation-inc-achr-a-bull-case-theory-4-1606309/

The main issues are that they’ve missed earnings ($0.36 loss vs expected $0.24), and insiders have been selling significant shares recently. That always raises a red flag, even if it’s not a dealbreaker.

The stock’s trajectory is still promising, but progress has been slower than some expected. Their tech is solid, and the military angle could be a game-changer, but execution risk is real and timelines aren’t guaranteed.

SP has now reached levels where some long-term investors might start considering adding again, but I’m still on the sidelines.

if demand is truly about to “double,” why would the biggest ai chip supplier on the planet be guaranteeing empty racks?

answer: current demand is uneven. frontier labs (openai, meta, etc) are burning compute, but enterprise adoption is way slower. workloads are lumpy. nvidia is hedging against slowdown *right now*.

With all the acquisitions and compensation to more leadership teams, losses are expected to increase to $ 250 million per quarter.

1niqq2t,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 15:10:53,Rate my collapse portfolio,"I have a feeling my portfolio is going to make a lot of people mad, but am curious for feedback.

I’ve historically (35 years in 401k) been a pretty modest but aggressive investor, only tweaking my mix every 2-3 years.  At the end of 2024 I moved most of my balance into a self-directed PCRA and into safer investments (mostly international bonds and international index funds).  I shifted a bit more into stocks and precious metals in April and am up about 12% overall YTD.

I’m also a big believer in climate change and in the science behind [The Limits to Growth](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2023-08-14/which-future/), and all the recent science indicates we’re now experiencing climate change at an exponential rate, which will continue to accelerate.  I think that in the next 5-10 years it will be impossible for people to deny, although some will choose to think of it as biblical end times.  Add in all the predictions of a big economic downturn, I’m ready to lock in on a longer term strategy.  

I’m not savvy enough to know if it’s going to be a recession, depression, stagflation or hyperinflation scenario, but it seems like the Permanent Portfolio strategy has consistently outperformed other portfolios in these types of conditions:

* 25% bonds
* 25% stocks
* 25% cash
* 25% gold

Given my long term outlook for societal collapse by \~2040 (give or take 5 years), and the limitations associated with an employer sponsored account, here are the modifications I’ve made:

**25% bonds (+ bond proxies)**

* 10% in ISGH
* 10% in XLU
* 5% in FPI 

I’m betting on utilities to do well with the change to regs around exporting natural gas, and increasing scarcity in general.  I’d like to be more heavily into farmland, but not super comfortable with any of the REIT’s right now to commit more.

**25% stocks**

* 11% in VYMI & IEUR index funds
* 11% in “collapse” stocks
* 3% in my unicorn stock, ASTS

Collapse stocks include companies in agriscience, fertilizer, firefighting chemicals, air conditioner manufacturers, and some Trump admin-inspired stocks like COIN (holding) and PLTR (just unloaded).  I would love to diversify more in this category, open to suggestions.

**25% cash / 25% gold**

* 10% in a 4% CD, which would cover 8-10 mos of expenses
* 15% in physical gold and silver, the remainder of liquid assets
* 25% in gold and precious metals ETF’s

I will purchase more physical gold/silver and reallocate the funds in ETF’s as able.  My goal is to maintain purchasing power as things continue to unravel.  

Anyone thinking along the same lines?  For those who think my outlook is crazy, how do you think this mix will perform?

1nih5qo,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 09:14:19,Defying the news: why do prices sometimes move in the opposite direction of the data?,"Sometimes, a much anticipated new release comes out, and the prices go the exact opposite way than you’d expect. 

Today, US Core Retail Sales for August came in at +0.7% MoM - much better than the expected. Logically, stronger consumer spending signals a robust economy, which should boost the USD and in turn push EUR/USD lower.

But this didn’t happen, at least at the time of writing. EUR/USD is still pushing higher, at 1.18100 and testing multi-year highs. 

Why does this happen?

Here are a few key reasons:

- Buy the rumour, sell the news: Markets often price in expectations before the data hits. Traders anticipated solid retail numbers amid ongoing economic optimism, so the ""good"" news was already baked in. Once confirmed, profit-taking kicks in, reversing the trend.

- Overriding Factors: This one is vital to understand: even strong data can get overshadowed by bigger fundamental stories. Right now, the USD is under pressure from expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, and this dilutes the USD appeal.

- Technicals and Sentiment: Charts matter. EUR/USD has been in a bullish channel, with support at 1.1760 holding firm. Also, broader risk-on sentiment can trump a single US bit of good news.

- Not All Beats Are Equal: If the data ""beat"" isn't massive, it might not shift the narrative as we may expect. A 0.3% surprise here wasn't enough to derail the dovish Fed story or the general USD down sentiment. 

This is the market's way of reminding us: it's not just about the data released – it's about context and the bigger picture. 

The only remedy: an open mind ready for any outcome, and sound risk management.

But I have a contrarian view. Their recent promo 25for25 on the surface may seem like a short term money grabber. But it might be a key to long term sustainability/growth. Those of you not familiar with this promo, just take a look at r/jetblue among other flyer forums and you will be surprised how many people are doing it. The gist of the promo is that you fly to 25 destinations by the end of the year and you get x amount of their mileage points and a status with them for next 25 years. Directly, B6 may lose some money on these flyers (the points one earns roughly offset the amount one spends to acquire them). But imagine this. A person who is sitting on these points, and has a status with the airline, is going to do anything in his/her power to fly with them... for next 25 years. Not just them, their companions who may or may not have the status will likely fly with them too. So, I think it may be the thing that helps JetBlue survive. Third and fourth quarter earnings will give us some data to prove/disprove this theory. Thoughts?

On one side, there's great excitement for AI that drives company values up. It resembles a gold rush, as everyone believes they've discovered the next big thing. At the same time, bond yields are rising, which typically makes investors more careful and can cause them to withdraw money from the stock market. This creates a strange mix of optimism and caution.

This situation raises the classic question: is this a true tech revolution or just a bubble waiting to burst? I find that the real challenge of holding these stocks is the wild fluctuations. One day you’re significantly up, and the next you’re down just as much. It's not suitable for the faint of heart.

To handle this kind of volatility, perhaps the strategy isn't to chase the latest trend but to think long-term and diversify. It might be better to find companies that genuinely use AI to address problems, rather than simply riding the hype.

* [**VXUS**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/vxus/) (30%)

I've considered adding **value**, specifically small-cap value, and **momentum** tilt to my portfolio. Here is my plan:

* **US vs. Non-US** = 60:40
* **Market cap weight (MCW) vs. Factors** = 75:25
* **Value vs. Momentum** = 60:40

I've also been studying most ETFs' methodology, and I like Avantis and Alpha Architect. Here are what I plan to add:

* [**AVUV**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/avuv/): Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF
* [**AVDV**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/avdv/): Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF
* [**QMOM**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/qmom/): Alpha Architect U.S. Quantitative Momentum ETF
* [**IMOM**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/imom/): Alpha Architect International Quantitative Momentum ETF

Here is what my equity portfolio would look like with the tilt:

* VTI = 45%
* AVUV = 9%
* QMOM = 6%
* VXUS = 30%
* AVDV = 6%
* IMOM = 4%

Besides the increased rebalancing difficulties and management fee of this new plan, my biggest concern is how much time I need to commit to it. Both [Rick Ferri](https://youtu.be/e7_MFyltNt4?t=415) and Wes Gray agreed that a tilted portfolio may require 25 years of commitment, due to its tracking error. However, in studies, value and momentum have a strong negative correlation, so when both are together, they should help smooth out the performance.

I believe in factor premiums, and I'm confident with this plan. My most considerable doubt is the long-term commitment, which I can't guarantee due to my health condition. My kids may inherit my portfolio once I'm gone, and I assume they might prefer to see some evidence to trust this plan.

I'm looking forward to hearing some feedback about my new portfolio, especially if you have also looked into factor tilting before or have already added one or two factors to your portfolio.

Hey guys I'm 19, started investing this year I have 8k invested. I did my first year of university but I want to switch my major and drop out of my current university. If I drop out right now I'd only get a 50% refund from my school meaning I need to pay around 1.7k And Id need to pay my 5k loan back on top of that (if I don't drop out I don't need to pay that loan back for another 2 years) 

I have no idea what major id switch to but I didn't do grade 12 math cause I didn't need it for the major I'm currently in. This worries me because idk if I'll be able to get into another program and I might need to go to college instead or redo whatever Highschool courses I need to do. 

I was thinking that if I can just find a part time job and drop out of school I'll be able to afford to lose that 6.7k. But I feel like finding a part time job will be insanely hard and probably unlikely due to job shortage.

The thought I have in my head is to just work as much as I can, pay for school after the gap year and invest the rest of the money. I have no expenses since I am lucky enough to live with my parents. 

I have the idea in my head that you can become financially free by just working maybe even average paying job and putting 90% of the salary into investing until my compounding interest is more than my yearly contributions, then buy a small affordable apartment and eventually upgrade to something else and perhaps rent it out for extra income. 

Any tips? Is it unrealistic? Can you get financially free with any job? 

For some reason I'm really worried about my future and confused on what I want to do, but I do know that I want to invest as much money as I can. 

Anyone who tells me to just enjoy my life while I'm young, Its possible to do both isn't it?

I reached out to both advisors (partners) in May to invest the cash reserve part of my portfolio (16% is cash - and I wanted to invest about half of that), and they didn't respond and I forgot about. Now I see that practically any investment at that point would had have quite a few gains now. Google was 180, now 250 for example - one of the stocks I would have added. 

At a later date I asked them to sell Vital Farms stock (had a lot of gains in that one) and trade it for Google. They suggested to wait until earnings, and then sell.  After earnings, it Vital climbed to $50 and Google was at 200. Earnings came and went, and they didn't make that trade! Vital Farms is pretty much flat or lower now.

I understand brokers work to balance portfolios, and I do give mine the agency needed to make trades without contacting me for each and every one.

My goal is to watch how the stock market performs against sports bets. While I think I know how this will go -- I want to see it from the outside with no bias.

1ni0ifz,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 18:40:04,I just had a fascinating conversation about US exceptionalism vis a vis our shift to 401k versus pensions,"This is going to be long and only for the hardcore investment nerds I think. I asked a question, namely, ""does the consistent, robotic, unemotional influx of money from US retirement investors (buying pressure) have a stabilizing effect on the US market and does it contribute to US exceptionalism. The answer is a resounding ""yes"" it would seem. 

1. The US market holds the largest share of investors on the planet. Over 50% of the entire globe's investors are US investors, representing trillions of dollars.

2. As a result, these steady, cyclical drips into the US markets (home bias: most US investors invest in US companies) provide a stabilizing effect on domestic stocks. Even in down markets, there is a constant drip-feed of millions buying stocks undriven by emotion. 

3. This constant, drip-fed influx of money (regardless of market conditions) provides US companies with an advantage in the form of cheap capital, that is then used for R&D, only further ensuring that US products and companies recieve the highest level of innovation

4. This entire dynamic contributes to a de facto ""moat"" around the US market allowing to better weather troughs in the economic cycle, and maintain an innovation advantage over international competitors, increasing US market performance. 

It made me realize that because of our shift from defined pensions (in the 80s) to defined contributions in individual stock portfolios was a ""happy accident"" of sorts when the first 401k was dreamt up in 1979. By adopting the 401k (or similar) as the de facto retirement vehicle for people, we also managed to create a ""self feeding beast"" of sorts in the US market. This machine-like drip feed of funds is a major factor in what we call US exceptionalism, and it more than likely will help perpetuate it going forward.

1nhy2zb,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 17:02:24,Arguments for and against international diversification,"I am currently in the process of reweighting and simplifying my portfolio. Around 85% of my holdings are in the USA, with 15% in developed international.

As of late, I have been considering reweighting this and potentially adding in emerging market exposure.

The US has outperformed international for some time now. I can see some reasons to believe that American Exceptionalism could continue.

1. Many American brands have a very high prestige around the world and can eat into international market share
2. Some American companies have a technological edge which will attract business from around the globe
3. The US has a very business-friendly climate and regulatory structure.
4. I see storm clouds on the horizon for many developed international markets, namely the birth rate crisis, sovereign debt issues, and business-hostile climate. Emerging markets similarly have their own problems, namely political risk, and environmental/climate issues.

However I can also see some basic arguments in favor of diversification:

1. Sure the US has outperformed in recent memory but that may be all the more reason for international stocks with more reasonable P/E ratios to outperform, moving forward.
2. The de-dollarization process has begun. [Foreign central banks now hold more Gold reserves than Treasuries for the first time in 30 years](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzrOr3jXEAA7pGm?format=jpg&name=medium) and the USA more generally is exhibiting signs of emerging market behavior. Rising populism from both parties, the erosion of Federal Reserve independence, a new push for more direct federal government management of the economy (tariffs, Intel, etc.), and the potential of monetizing the national debt all introduce a new set of risks and challenges for the US market.
3. Even with immigration, the US is not immune to the demographic problems plaguing the rest of the developed world. US deaths are expected to outpace births by 2031. Emerging markets have growing populations who are becoming educated and plugged into the internet at a breakneck pace.

Bryce C. Tingle, business law prof at U. of Calgary, writes;

> Over the past 30 years, the number of companies that sell shares on markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq has fallen by roughly 50 percent.  ... I have spent more than a decade trying to understand what is going on, and I have come to believe that the culprit is public company governance, the system in which many different groups, all pursuing their own agendas, generate rules for how public companies ought to be managed. These rules, norms and regulations — which tackle such issues as who gets to be a director, how executives should be paid, in what ways companies ought to respond to climate change — are constantly accruing and building on one another until this obscure process generates towering structures that, like a great coral reef, can tear out the bottom of a boat. 

> From 2000 to 2020, only about 10 percent of a thousand successful venture-capital-backed companies chose to go public.

Does this mean that regular investors are fighting for the scraps, leading to a bubble in the highly valued tech stocks that are publicly traded?

Google AI tells me that US private companies are worth $14T, vs $63T public market cap.  But if this $14T is concentrated in novel tech, it's significant.  On the other hand,  most private cap companies are small.  On the third hand, it's likely comparatively little value resides in the long tail of small companies, just like the SP500.   For example, Anthropic is estimated to be worth $180B, and that's from a funding round, which I would think prices it conservatively.


Counterargument: if there's a bubble in AI and other tech, and you have a successful private company, it makes sense to go public and exploit that bubble by selling shares to a starving market.  Then again, it might make more sense to sell it when it's bigger, so the little guys don't get the benefit of the first phases of expansion.",79,33,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nhtsh0/nyt_fewer_companies_going_public_because_of/,new,Unknown,0.8

Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is possibly easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read?” I was just like you when I first read that. Here is what I learned.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•Target population of the US is 128 million people

	•A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year

	•The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600

⸻

Company Financial Health: Good

	•Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•I am unable to determine if their creation of this drug is protected by some type of IP or patent

	•It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•Financial health could be pressured if they fail to scale in an economical way

	•Short Interest is 30% – it is irrelevant to my thesis on this product but something you should all be aware of

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter.

Again this is high risk and although my name would lead you to believe I only hold small cap. Majority of my own funds are in diversified ETFs.

I’ve been looking into silver recently as a potential investment, and I’m curious what the community thinks.

On one hand, it seems like silver has some solid fundamentals:

* It’s both a precious metal and an industrial metal (used in electronics, solar panels, medical tech, etc.).
* Historically, it’s seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.
* Compared to gold, it looks relatively undervalued right now.

On the other hand:

* Silver can be extremely volatile, sometimes even more than gold.
* Industrial demand could fluctuate depending on the economy.
* It doesn’t provide dividends or yield, so holding it is a pure bet on price appreciation.

1nhhdz2,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 05:41:49,What are the best sectors to invest in in 2025?,"I'm looking at different sectors and industries, and he are my thoughts. Very interested in your feedback. 


IT & industrials
Even if AI will eventually flop, it's still going. However, with Mag7 valuations and EPS projections being far from perfect, I prefer looking at those who sell timber and iron to the shovel makers: COMM, STRL etc. 

Aerospace&Defense look really good considering ongoing conflicts and lack of tariff exposure.

Great sectors overall, but picking is a key. 

Comms
They are beating expectations harder what tech. Some great regional diversification, too, with VEON or IHS.


Materials
Despite a bull market, gold skyrocketed. Most of gold diggers though are still priced like an ounce is worth $2k, despite their margins are wide af. And with growing inflation, crappy bond yields, and high uncertainty, it's hard to imagine what could go wrong for gold. It's literally almost impossible to pick a bad stock there, an average gold stock has made 70% over a year. 


Financials
Banks should benefit from the falling interest rates. BNPL should benefit from this and reducing in consumer buying power. 


Energy
Nuclear is overbought, and oil seems to be on the downward trend, nothing to fish here. 


Consumer Staples
Not a bad choice with purchase power dropping. I really like CALM, for instance


Consumer Discretionary
Not sure I get a point why invest into them. Tech/Comms/Industrials will do better in a bull market, and this sector will be hurt just as much in the bear market. 


Utilities
Kinda same as with energy, I don't see green to be taking cash. I do like SBS though. Maybe hidden tech stocks like VTOL


Healthcare
I don't believe in biotech at large, but some pragmatic things like hospitals or telemedicine could be great


REIT
Nah, not with BBB :)

I felt I would quit job in first few years and open a business but never materialized, so I kept living life on autopilot, just doing 9-5. In covid, i started taking interest watching lot of news about stock rocketing. I opened brokerage account and started investing, in doing so sold my employer RSU feeling it'll drop but it only double after I sold. Then to catch up for time lost, I taking big bets, invested 700k in various stocks and SPUS, but in August 2024 when trump announced tarriffs, lost 10% and panicked and sold losing 70k in cash. Then again mustered courage, and invested in Feb 2025, again tarriffs were announced, lost 20k. Then have been away from market ever since.

I also bought house all cash in 2023, as felt i have so much cash why should I do mortgage (also am against borrowing money on interest), but sadly house didn't appreciated, I bought in Austin, rather price dropped from price I bought. I feel as much I chase for parking money watching everyone multiply their savings, more I'm losing money. Till date not only I have lost appreciation by not investing in SP500 over years but have lot 90k in cash value of money and some 10ks of dollars in house. I am not complaining as I'm lucky to earn this but also wish to earn passive income or see appreciation so can save money for my family. I see people who don't have passive income or savings invested have to work till late age in life even if they don't like it.

How do I start now, SP500 has been breaking record every other week for last few months. But with global events unfolding every week, if I put my entire life savings into them, how do I navigate if a recession hits?

1nh8zz6,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 21:37:53,Housing Market to Crash?  …It’s Complicated.,"Since 2021, I’ve been hearing a lot of talk on a housing market bubble. 

I’m here to say, with incredible confidence, that I’m actually not confident about where housing prices will find themselves in the coming years…at all. BUT I don’t think this disqualifies me from offering some insight for you other brave souls to carry the torch where I’ve stumbled in the dark. 

I built two important models, today, both of which can completely justify the median home price at current interest rates… and argue against it entirely. 

The current market prices seem “allowable” if I’m allowed to assume that the market projects a rate fall from the 6s to the low 3s. Then it makes sense. 
Let’s start with the home values current. Some estimates put median home prices for 2025 around 410k and other are as high as 440k.  I believe Zillow has a figure around 380k. So, for all intents and purposes, I like 410k. 

Whether or not these prices are deeply overpriced really come down to just what the average interest rates should look like over the next 30 years from here. And I did a little ‘mathing’ to prove that.

I regressed the monthly payment per square footage of median-priced homes over the last 30 years. This model assumes a 10% down payment, then incorporates average interest rates of each period to derive monthly payment.. then divides by square footage of median sized home in each year (took forever to find). 

From that trend line, we can see that the market mean for 2025 would have the payment per square ft at 72 cents. 
Converting that into a monthly payment brings us to around $1600/ month for principal and interest. 

All the to say the trend from 1995 to 2025 would reasonably have someone pay that. Given today’s interest rates, that would then price the projected home value for 2025 around 290-300k. 
Now that’s not the national average, is it? 
No. Absolutely not. Should we be upset? Well, hang on..

Here’s why that figure still might be a gross underestimation of how the market ‘should’ price homes: 
It doesn’t factor in the potential for refinancing. 

If the market broadly accepts interest rates to hover around 6-6.5% for the next 30 years, then we would probably see homes take on lower prices. But we haven’t. So somewhere baked in, there must be a presumption of what long term interest will look like moving forward. 

So, I started playing around with the figures and reset the objective of finding what interest rate the market would imply, assuming that the home prices today are priced perfect. 
So I plugged in the median home price today (410k) combined with the market’s regression of monthly payments (normalized to square footage) and got back 3.22%…ish. 

The question from here is, which idea sounds crazier? 
Is it crazier to think interest rates moving outward will effectively be around 3.22%, or is it crazier to think that homes are selling for a 40-45% premium? 

In one world, interest rates would have to be cut in half in the next few years and in another world housing prices would have to either stagnate for a decade or fall by 30% in the next year. 


Now, I understand no model is perfect, and mine is really not factoring in any nuances experienced in this year vs any other, but it certainly stands on principle. That principle is “Something has to give”.

So, what do you think? Are we in a bubble? Have prices climbed with inflation? Can we reasonably expect lower interest rates? Can we expect a major correction?

1ngal7f,2025-09-13,2025-09-13 18:25:40,AMZN covered calls free money?!,"We have some vested AMZN RSUs that have been pretty stagnant but I’m bullish on the company and we’re plenty diversified so we’re holding. 




About a month ago I was reading some covered call strategies and AMZN stood out as a decent company to sell covered calls on. So I tried it weekly for the last month, on Friday I’d sell a CC for the next Friday from $130-248 each. After rolling the cost and putting aside some money for the tax man I came out with about $440. That’s just under 2% return for the month. 



If I do this every month and let the cash sit in a money market or reinvest I come out with a pretty healthy profit. Now I just have the 100 shares so it is a bit of effort for just $440/mn but we have more vesting soon and once we get 200-300 shares that’s not bad. 




Here’s where it’s free money:


1. I’ll get this out of the way: I’m completely fine if these get called and I have to sell. It’s been an underperformed and was “free” to begin with. I’m not expecting amzn to have a crazy week and I miss out on a double. 




2. I’ve been selling 232.5 and 235 calls. Amazon has struggled to pass the $240 and only a few times in the last year did it get to $235+ making it fairly unlikely for it then to be called.



3. AMZN shouldn’t have many unexpected upside moves, it’s just not historically likely. Making it somewhat safe. However it does tend to float between $215-230 meaning this should be a fairly sustainable approach for me to keep doing every week or two.




I’m not sure if I’m missing something obvious? Like the biggest risks are losing out on future gains of the shares if it gets called and taxes right? But the taxes are factored in and the return is still decent and the future gains I’m just not particularly worried about and it seems I’d be able to buy back in. I’m genuinely open to advice if I’m fucking something up, but I don’t think I am and it seems like a solid strategy.

August deliveries were \~40 % down YoY. 2nd quarter results were not as bad as that, but still nothing good. The deliveries for Q2 were only \~2% higher YoY. 4.5 % declined revenue, net income essentially flat.

However, they guided for Q3 deliveries and revenue to decline \~40% YoY!

Finally, their upcoming models don't bode very well, IMO. Their BEV models don't look very interesting aesthetically--in fact, kind of ugly. The upcoming i6 seems to look alright but nothing special. I'm not seeing how they're going to compete well in the extremely competitive Chinese market if Chinese consumers continue shifting to BEVs, and that's the area that Li Auto seems least competitive in. They achieved a lot of growth on hybrids, but their BEV models have been relatively unsuccessful so far. But the future lies in EVs, I think. I don't see how Li's competitiveness is going to improve with boring-looking cars, when Chinese consumers have so many other options to find good value propositions.

So, I don't get it. Why has this stock not collapsed more? It's trading at about the same price as at the end of April. At that time it was delivering \~35k vehicles/month, compared to \~28k in August.

Li Auto themselves predict that their next quarter will be terrible, with 40% YoY declines in deliveries and revenue.

Over the last few decades where the assumption was generally “dollar strong, don’t want foreign currencies dropping to eat the returns of dollars invested internationally” those hedges were essentially a form of downside insurance for exchange rates wiping out returns “from the dollar perspective.”

I admit to a lot of ignorance about how the funds actually implement hedging strategies, but are they bi directional or are they just implemented to insure against downside currency risk from the dollar perspective?  That is, if an international bond paying interest in Euros is hedged now and the dollar is falling, does the hedging effectively make performance worse from the dollar perspective?

1nfwv0f,2025-09-13,2025-09-13 08:58:13,Your sustainable fund might not be what you think it is,"A massive academic review of sustainable investing research uncovered something concerning: recent studies show many funds labeled as ""sustainable"" or ""ESG"" actually contain companies with significant ESG controversies.

The research analyzed nearly 1,000 papers spanning 35 years and found that while sustainable investing exploded after 2015, the methods for screening companies remain surprisingly primitive. Most research relies on backward-looking data rather than predictive analysis, and there's virtually no use of modern technology to detect or prevent greenwashing.

This matters for individual investors because you might think you're investing ethically while inadvertently funding practices you oppose. The fund labels and ESG ratings we rely on appear to have significant blind spots.

The study suggests we're in the early stages of sustainable investing - like the dial-up era of ESG. The infrastructure for truly effective sustainable screening is still being built.

If you're investing in ESG funds, this research suggests doing additional due diligence beyond just trusting the label or rating. The field is evolving rapidly, but current methods may not be as reliable as they appear.

1nf46bi,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 10:06:01,Is Oracle just SoftBank wearing a mask?,"Let me get this straight:

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?

I’ve been digging into ANGX (Angel Studios) now that it’s newly public, and I’m curious what others think about this one in its early days.

A few things caught my attention:

In less than a year, Angel Studios grew its Guild membership from 600,000 to 1.5 million.

That kind of subscriber growth feels exponential and, in some ways, comparable to Netflix in its early expansion phase.

The company already has a proven track record of producing surprise hits (e.g. Sound of Freedom, homestead and others), and if they can keep scaling content and membership, the upside could be massive.

I’m not saying this is a guaranteed rocket ship. nothing is, but if Angel continues on this trajectory, it could be a 10× in the next decade or two. Some even think it could become one of those rare 100× companies, but obviously that’s speculation.

Right now, I’m mainly shooting for the 10× potential and want to hear what others think:

Do you see ANGX as a serious long-term hold?

Is anyone else planning to buy in or build a position and just let it ride for years?

Or do you think the hype fades and the business model isn’t sustainable at scale?

Would love to hear different takes especially from those who invest in high-growth, early-stage public companies.",12,33,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nejleo/thoughts_on_angx_angel_studios_as_a_longterm_play/,new,Unknown,0.81

I didn’t buy it as an investment, I bought it only because my MIL told me to, so I did just out of respect. Indian family by the way. Gold is a sentiment in India, in case you weren’t aware.

Not sure I understand how it has appreciated by 30% till date. 

Chat, is the civilization about to collapse? I don’t think I’ve seen a parabolic gold price chart before. 

I see a lot of reports that say the gold will touch 5k in the next year. But I know more than to trust analyst estimates.

I have read that some analyst believe that the rate cut will cause the market to soar for a short time after, but then there are some that believe it could make a drop for a short time.

So what would be some ETF's or stocks to buy before to maybe catch a nice bump up?

1ned4dy,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 12:18:54,Oracle phenomena - “legacy” players pushing AI reaction?,"The recent case of Oracle got me thinking about the state of the markets, the AI hype and reality, and what it means for the future.

I’ve been pretty skeptical about Oracle’s surge, but they are about to recognize a lot of revenues. This market reaction is interesting because so far, the “big AI” bets were companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, Google, Meta, Broadcom, etc. Oracle, by contrast, has long been seen as more of a legacy play, focused on infrastructure for large enterprises.

What we’re seeing is that investors still go crazy for AI, especially when an established, “old guard” player gets involved. Is this an overreaction? Hard to say. Ideally, markets should value not just AI mentions and vision, but the actual value being unlocked. Maybe that’s exactly what’s being priced in here or maybe it’s an over- or underreaction, since we still don’t fully understand what AI will ultimately deliver.

Ofc there is lot more to Oracle than this but still im very curiousy

I’m curious to hear your take: are investors overestimating, underestimating, or pricing it just right? What do you think?:/

1nebv6b,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 11:29:55,Maintain cash savings with a 2-3 year Hozizon. Should I hold this allocation in my Roth IRA?,"A fairly large portion of my portfolio is cash (T-Bills) right now, as I am maintaining savings with which I could buy a house in 2-3 years. I'm thinking of re-allocating my portfolio so that more of the cash is kept within tax advantaged accounts - specifically my Roth IRA - as otherwise taxes eat away at the interest (I'm in a high bracket).

Example trade:

* Sell $10,000 T-Bills in Brokerage
* Buy $10,000 VTI in Brokerage.
* Sell $10,000 VTI in Roth
* Buy $10,000 T-Bill in Roth.

Portfolio doesn't change, only where I hold it. **When I want to ""tap"" the cash, I just do the same trade, but in reverse**.

Downsides are that I probably lose a buck or two to the bid ask spread. Upsides are I'd be ""buying"" when valuations are high, so that if there is a market crash I'd be able to tax loss harvest VTI to VOO or something like that (which I couldn't do in Roth), and I'm not paying taxes on the T-Bill interest.",3,13,0,investing,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nebv6b/maintain_cash_savings_with_a_23_year_hozizon/,new,Unknown,0.64
