Literally scum

Edit: Should have mentioned, it's literally fucking impossible to squeeze silver. It's not shorted at all. Hedge funds and Citadel hold lots of Long positions in it, not shorts. Buying it would be playing right into their hands.

Buying silver will make you likely lose money and absolutely give it to the hedge funds and Citadel.

By Silver, I mean $SLV, *I know nothing about phisical silver*. For anybody confused

Edit 2: If you bought $SLV months or years ago and made a profit, that's fantastic. This post is just saying that you should not buy silver right now.

Summary by Bloomberg Al

■ President Donald Trump has asked the US Supreme Court to allow him to immediately fire top officials at two independent agencies.

■ The case is testing a 90-year-old Supreme Court ruling that lets Congress shield high-ranking officials from being fired by the president.

The outcome could determine whether Trump has the power to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and could also impact the job security of other agency officials.

BEIJING, March 31 (Reuters) - China, Japan and South Korea agreed to jointly respond to U.S. tariffs, a social media account affiliated with Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said on Monday.The comments came after the three countries held their first [economic dialogue](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-china-japan-agree-promote-regional-trade-trump-tariffs-loom-2025-03-30/) in five years on Sunday, seeking to facilitate regional trade as the Asian export powers brace against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

EU hasn't even clap back yet.

Edit. For those who say this is Chinese media, the other countries are not refuting this claim. China is taking the lead on this. For EU, I think Germany will take the lead on that.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said appeasement will only embolden the “bully” at a BRICS meeting, rallying the group of emerging-market nations to fight back against US levies.

China’s top diplomat warned countries against caving into US tariff threats, as the Trump administration hints at the possible use of new trade tools to pressure Beijing.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said appeasement will only embolden the “bully” at a BRICS meeting, rallying the group of emerging-market nations to fight back against US levies. The stern remarks show China intends to resist pressure to enter trade talks even as US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggests Washington could ban certain exports to China to gain leverage.

Wang’s call to the international community underscores China’s attempt to portray itself as the bastion of free trade as US tariffs threaten to reshape commerce globally. Beijing has repeatedly urged allies to defend multilateralism and told other governments not to cut deals with the US president at China’s expense. China has repeatedly denied being engaged in trade talks with the US. Instead, Beijing has demanded mutual respect and a cancellation of all tariffs before any negotiations.

I wonder how Trump is going to respond to this. Maybe another 500% tariffs on China? Including this and GDP data this Wednesday, market is going to get rekt. Get your lubes ready.

The shopping site will display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs – right next to the product’s total listed price.

Do note, posts and comments are still restricted to users with a higher Karma and account age.

##Important information

First, let's get some things out of the way:

* The short squeeze has not squoze yet, short interest estimates are still extremely high, I won't post the sources and encourage you to search for it yourself.
* The gamma squeeze has not happened, it may happen Monday, it may happen gradually, it may not happen (if their positions have already been covered), it isn't necessary for anything to happen, however.
* The establishment is still lying about many things for the purpose of market manipulation (Jim Cramer, CNBC, etc.). These people are SOLD. Read Canadian news channels regarding the situation, they are much less biased! 
* Google and Apple and removing negative reviews from bad brokers from their app stores, put a calendar reminder in 2-6 weeks to add your review at that time, instead of now.

##Let's make a list of the Brokers that restricted the purchasing of specific tickers

The worst thing that happened this week were the restrictions that our brokers put on buying specific tickers. This, obviously, affected the stock market, tanked those tickers, and significantly reduced our trust in the institutions at hand.

Now, I'm aware the reasons for this are complicated, we know that for many of them, they were forced to restrict these tickers by their Clearing Houses (Apex being the main one), we don't exactly know why, or whether that is legal or not, however.

**One thing for certain, the communication by the brokers and clearing houses was very, very, very bad. This, in turns, significantly harmed the public's trust in them, as well as the institutions in charge of regulating this.**

Here is my list, please comment below and let me know which ones I've missed:

### Note regarding the clearing houses

The first step is to know why brokers restricted the trading. The second step is to investigate what happened with the clearing houses. Currently, the following clearing houses seem to have had the most issues:

* Apex Clearing
* Barclays
* IKBR

We don't know if these firms acted maliciously (protecting themselves before protecting the free market), or because they literally had no choice. If the former, they need to be punished. If the later, then laws need to change. EITHER WAY, something needs to change, this post is merely here to put attention on the problem, I don't claim to have the solution.

Additionally, there needs to be open communication about this issue, currently, they are not saying anything on social media regarding this. Once they do, I'll update this post with it.

Note: /r/ THICC_DICC_PRICC tried to explain this in some detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l90an8/an_explanation_of_what_caused_the_trading_halt/). I cannot attest to the accuracy/validity of his explanation, feel free to discuss that on his post.

We might keep this information on the sidebar...forever. Please help me build this list to completion. If you are using a broker in the bad list, even if you are not invested in the tickers that have been restricted, please consider moving to a better broker.

They have done nothing to ease the current situation and if this continues and if truly have black Monday awaiting tomorrow, it would be catastrophic economic crisis caused by the administration and would cause numerous businesses to go bankrupt and spark mass unemployment as a consequence.

This isn’t a dip. It’s not a correction. It’s the slow, brutal unraveling of a debt-soaked fantasy we’ve been pretending was sustainable since 2008. The Fed is cornered—rates are high, inflation refuses to die, and there's no bailout coming this time. The only soft landing is for the billionaires with parachutes made of your 401(k).

Tech is imploding under the weight of hype and weak fundamentals. AI was a sugar high. Now we’re crashing. Banks are getting shaky. Commercial real estate is a time bomb. And consumers? They're maxed out, broke, and paying 29% on credit cards to buy gas and eggs.

And just when we needed stability, we get chaos: Trump’s back in the mix with unhinged tariffs, trade wars 2.0, and economic policies that look like they were scribbled on a napkin in a Denny’s at 3 a.m. Markets hate uncertainty—guess what? That’s all we’ve got now.

This isn’t a crash. It’s controlled demolition with nobody at the controls.

Sell, don’t look back, and maybe plant a garden. We had a good run.

Goodbye, and may whatever comes next be merciful.

l8b4pp,2021-01-29,2021-01-29 21:07:37,Is anyone else feeling really depressed from the turn of events recently?,"I used to be a proud trader and investor, determined to break through the shackles of society to reach financial freedom. I started out with almost zero, and by capitalizing on the stock market frenzy last year, I was able to completely change my life around. I used to think that if I worked hard, did my due diligence, traded smartly, I could make great investments and someday reach the pinnacle of my financial dreams. Something has shifted now. I no longer feel the same way, and I'm not sure if I ever will again.

I wonder if it's naive of me to have thought that the free market was fair. I'm not American so I wasn't aware of the parties involved during the financial crisis in 2008, but it seems that many people are equating what's happening now to back then, calling out the blatant market manipulation in favor of the rich at the expense of the poor.

They can crash multiple brokerages at the same time, disable purchase of specific stocks instantaneously, manipulate price action in real-time by changing the supply/demand, unleash a short ladder attack on the stock price while the trade volume is being restricted. We've always understood that the media was manipulated, but it was up to us if we wanted to listen. But our direct purchase of stocks, and outright price action manipulation, suddenly it feels very personal.

It just makes me so sad to know that this hobby of mine that I've enjoyed and come to love so much, is actually controlled by people at the top who can do whatever they want, at any time they want in favor of their own interests. I came into the investing world filled with hope and excitement, and passion for the art of understanding business and capitalizing on opportunities. I'm sad to think that I may never have this outlook again, in light of everything that's been coming out.  Just looking for words of encouragement right now. I love investing and I don't want that joy to be taken from me

lazcak,2021-02-02,2021-02-02 11:14:50,What $GME has taught me in 36 hours of day trading,"Jumped on the $GME bandwagon on Friday, 4 @ \~316. My 36 hours of day trading has already taught me that no matter how this plays out, I will never YOLO on a bubble ever again.

The principle seemed straightforward: hedge funds got lazy/greedy, over-shorted their positions, bet against a company that wasn't actually going under, and some astute monkies on reddit caught them and triggered a short squeeze. Even as someone who knows almost nothing about the stock market, the basic premise makes sense. But the devil's in the details, and hype is blinding.

First red flag was when I realized [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) did not bet on the short squeeze, he bet on undervalued stock price *over a year ago*. He has also trimmed his position such that no matter what happens in the squeeze, he walks away with 8 figures. So the people screaming ""if he's still in, I'm still in!"" and ""look at those brass balls, if he can lose $5MM in a day then I can hold"" are really living up to the dumb ape meme. He didn't lose $5MM yesterday, he lost $5MM in \*unrealized gains\*, there is a \*huge\* difference.

Second red flag was a common sense idea that hedge funds won't go down without a fight, and they have literally billions of dollars and decades of experience. You don't get that without learning how to game the system in complex, subtle ways. So even if they are still heavily shorted (which they might not even be anymore), and even if somehow [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) is holding some kind of meaningful leverage over them, that doesn't rule out the very real possibility they have a dozen ways out of this that people like me have no idea about.

But even in the off chance that somehow this turns around, and $GME does go ""to the moon,"" that doesn't change the fact that it's bad long-term strategy to bet on bubbles and jump on bandwagons. They almost certainly fail, and if they don't, they only serve to inflate egos that will fall even harder on the next gamble. I'm still holding my shares but I don't expect to see my \~$1200 ever again. In the off chance I break even or see a profit here, I will count it as dumb luck and use it as seed money to learn how to invest in real long term gains.

**Edit:** holy shit RIP my inbox. No way I can read all that.

Want to clarify a few things. Not financial advice.

**My position:** I knew I was late to the party. I *wanted* to gamble. I knew what I was doing, and (mostly) why I did it. Hindsight showed me it was more based on emotion than I wanted to admit, but still, I'm not surprised by the outcome so far, and I'm totally OK with taking the L and calling it a lesson learned. I don't blame DFV, WSB, or anyone for my choices. I own them, even proudly, because I wanted to step out and take a calculated risk vs. sit on the sidelines out of fear of loss. I'm holding because I already bought my tickets to this ride, want to see this thing play out, and I'm fine with gambling the final $300 on the outside chance things turn around.

**Your positions:** brothers, sisters, nonbinary siblings: **you are not your portfolio**. whether up or down, your value is not based on how big or small an imaginary number is. you are a human being on the bleeding edge of 3.5 BILLION years of evolution, you have more actual success in your past and potential success in your future than you'll ever know. 12 years ago I was a penniless alcoholic literally stealing change from my grandpa to get loaded on 211 Steel Reserve. I hit my bottom, joined AA, and now I'm a network engineer, wife, kids, the whole lot. Anything is possible if you don't give up on yourself. But I know it's not that easy, we all need borrowed self-esteem before we can see the real value inside. So if this $GME gamble hit you hard, please reach out to someone. don't give up. Hell, this bubble isn't even over, it might even turn around! But either way, don't give up.

**Edit2:**

wow, never expected this to go this far. wrote it on my way out the door as a way to cope with the situation. read a ton of replies, probably missed most of them. thanks for all the love and hate and everything inbetween! A few more points:

* Agreed that RH deserves to be held accountable. No question they manipulated this.
* Agreed it's not over yet. the squeeze could happen. but if it does, **my** main personal takeaway from this experience will stand: I won't speculate on bubbles anymore. This is my position if I lose everything or make $100k.
* if you posted gains, that's awesome! so glad for you, I wish you the best!

**Edit3 2/3/21:**

Full disclosure, I closed my position this morning at a \~$900 realized loss.

My gut says the squeeze happened, short interest isn't what I thought it was on Friday, and the stock will return to actual value soon.

**Edit4 2/25/21:**

 President Donald Trump said he was watching volatility in the bond market in recent days and appeared to indicate that it was among the factors that led to his decision to institute a 90-day pause on some tariffs.

“I was watching the bond market. The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it’s beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,” he said.

CNN reported prior to the president’s decision that US Treasury yields had risen in recent days as investors sold off bonds. The benchmark 10-year yield Wednesday morning was 4.4% – up from 3.9% before Trump unveiled his tariffs.

Trump also said he watched JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Fox Business Network this morning.

The CEO “made the statement to the effect that something had to be done with the tariffs and trade. … He understood it,” Trump said. “It wasn’t sustainable what was happening. Somebody had to pull the trigger. I was willing to pull the trigger.”

During that appearance, Dimon warned that a recession was a “likely outcome” of the escalating trade war resulting from Trump’s tariff policies.

“No one’s wishing for (a recession) but hopefully if there is one it’ll be short,” he said. “I do think fixing these tariff issues and trade issues would be a good thing to do.”

rh65q3,2021-12-15,2021-12-15 13:45:07,Pelosi rejects stock-trading ban for members of Congress: 'We are free market economy. They should be able to participate in that',"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday rejected the idea of banning members of Congress and their spouses from holding and trading individual stocks while in office.

""This is a free market, and people — we are a free market economy. They should be able to participate in that,"" Pelosi said when asked by Insider at her weekly press conference.

Insider also asked Pelosi about ""Conflicted Congress,"" a 5-month-long investigation by Insider that found 49 members of Congress and 182 senior congressional staffers have violated the STOCK Act, a law to prevent Insider trading.

The Speaker said she had not yet seen the project, but said that it's important that members are complying with the law.

""If people aren't reporting, they should be,"" she said.

Pelosi's position puts her at odds with the likes of progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both of whom have called for banning members of congress from trading stocks while in office.

""It is absolutely ludicrous that members of Congress can hold and trade individual stock while in office,"" Ocasio-Cortez recently wrote on Twitter. ""The access and influence we have should be exercised for the public interest, not our profit. It shouldn't be legal for us to trade individual stock with the info we have.""

And on Tuesday, Sen. Warren told Insider that she had seen Insider's investigation, calling out the ""brazenness"" of members and staffers trading stocks even while having access to privileged knowledge.

""We need both tougher laws and enforcement of those laws,"" the Massachusetts Democrat told Insider. ""The American people should never have to guess whether or not an elected official is advancing an issue or voting on a bill based on what's good for the country or what's good for their own personal financial interests."" 

Asked about progressives' position on the issue, a spokesman for Pelosi signaled that the speaker prefers a transparency-focused approach to insider trading.

""The STOCK Act exists to shine a bright light on trades by members of Congress,"" said spokesman Drew Hammill. ""Sunlight is the best disinfectant.""

""The speaker does not own any stocks,"" he continued. ""As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked 'SP' for spouse. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.""

Pelosi's husband, investor Paul Pelosi, frequently trades significant numbers of stocks. With her husband's assets considered, Pelosi ranks among the wealthiest members of Congress, according to an Insider analysis.

Insider has identified numerous examples of federal lawmakers trading stocks in industries they oversee as part of their congressional committee assignments, including within the defense, healthcare, and energy industries.

**WARNING: THIS IS AN EXTREMELY RISKY PLAY: THERE ARE NO METRICS OR CURRENT DATA TO PROVIDE SOLID DD TO HAVE A MORE “CERTAIN” OUTCOME. WHAT YOU ARE TRULY BETTING ON IS OTHER PEOPLE. I WONT TRY TO CONVINCE YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY. THIS IS MY SPECULATION, MY OPINION  AND IT VERY WELL COULD BE WRONG**

Hello all, 

I wanted to post last night as many of you commenters have asked for however my building lost power and it was absolutely awful. I am currently a refuge and my ladies house and wanted to get this out to the world.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, but more importantly this is all simply speculation. If anyone wants to make counter claims they are more than welcome but word of advice to all readers. If anyone is claiming that they know exactly what is going to happen...they are lying. There simply isn't enough current data to push this either direction. I am a bull, big time and I would like to explain why.

**First let's talk about yesterday**

There are a lot of claims of short ladder attacks and the counter-claim is that it was MM's moving the price down. One thing appears certain, there is some sort of manipulation happening in an attempt to drive the price down. Whether this is MM's, HF's, or simply retail shorts and bears; there are a strange number of exchanges happening in a clear effort to lower the price. You can check out the real time quotes [here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades).

Another large thought about why the price should have gone **up** yesterday was because of the options thats expired Friday 1/29 ITM. The rule is T+2 meaning these individuals have two business days to cover. Well, we expected a surge of these individuals covering and it simply never came. Everyone was glued to the screen Friday ATH waiting to see the spike of covering...but it never happened. Monday again...never happened. Tuesday...oh boy this is their last day they have to cover! Yet...they didn't. So what does this mean? Well, I see two possibilities.

1. They somehow timed it perfectly and covered throughout the dips and spikes
2. They haven't covered yet

I'm in the camp of number 2 hence why I am a bull. If they didn't cover that results in a Failure to Deliver which you can learn about [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp). So what does this mean for us? Well, that would explain the tremendous price drop as FTD's create ""phantom shares"" a problem GME is already facing. This will dilute the price tremendously and the amount of FTD's that probably occurred would greatly dilute the price. ""With [forward contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp), a party with a short position's failure to deliver can cause significant problems for the party with the [long position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp). This difficulty happens because these contracts often involve substantial volumes of assets that are pertinent to the long position's business operations."" From the earlier mentioned website regarding FTD's.

Now this is truly fascinating. The 2008 crisis was largely in part due to a mass number of FTD's. In fact, FTD's sometime intentionally happen...just to drive the price down for FUD so they can then cover at a better price. 

So if this is correct, what happens next? Well, either you can [read about it here](https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf). Simply put, the individual has to close out the positions after 13 consecutive settlement days of FTD. So all this logic about T+2 was actually just the logic to begin the FTD countdown, if it hasn't already started at the beginning of this.

Now, I'm not saying ""nobody sold"" of course people did. But volume is key and the interest in buying outweighed the interest in selling 3-1 Monday and Tuesday. Of course trades are 1-1 but interest was on the buyer side. 

Obviously, I don't even need to mention it but restricted trading really is what screwed this thing to begin with. My opinion? It wasn't to prevent a massive short squeeze, it was to buy them time.

**Today**

So why the hell did it spike this morning? Two reasons.

1. RH still has 100 shares limit on GME, now for those who don't realize, that doesn't mean that is 100 shares per day. No no. The restriction is you can own up to 100 shares of GME. If you already own over 100 shares that's fine, but anyone with less than 100 shares can only add up to that amount. This restriction has not changed and other companies such as Revolut are still imposing a 100% trading restriction on GME. So what did RH offer today? The ability to purchase fractional shares, which doesn't help a whole lot but the fact that buying pressure accelerated at the notion of fractional shares shows that there is still an immense amount of buyers out there.
2. GameStop [adds new CTO to the roster, an ex AWS lead engineer.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/03/2169124/0/en/GameStop-Appoints-Chief-Technology-Officer.html) They added other executive positions as well. This further cements the change the company is taking.

Now, before I get into the rest I want to address something: the fundamentals.

There is a disturbing echo chamber around the idea that GameStop is a dying brick and mortar retailer and there is no chance at survival. That is simply not the case. I don't want to do a full GME DD here because this is about the second incoming squeeze. However, let me put it to you this way:

If you were told that a new company was IPO'ing and it was coming to the market with an infrastructure, new talented team, 50 million customers and their plan was to become an e-commerce company to compete with Amazon; their plans for the physical locations was to be game-centric, a place for e-sports to compete, desktop building kiosks, and the newest systems and physical copies of games for those who still love having a physical copy. Not just that, but this company already has revenue share deals with Microsoft and other bigwig companies.

Knowing all that information would you be interested in this company? My answer is an easy yes. The thing with digital transformation and companies changing direction is people get so lost in what the company used to be they can't see what the company is planning on becoming. If this was a brand new company that Ryan Cohen was leading with the same exact model people would be all over the concept. 

Enough of that. Let's talking about what is still going on today which is truly fascinating. 

So the good news created a large uptick follow by a combination of people escaping with whatever gains they could salvage and some more clear manipulation regardless of the source. But then what? Well, after the bounce down a lot of people saw this as a fantastic buying opportunity which made it recover quickly...but then something interesting started happening. It started uptrending. Slowly. Steadily. Uptrending. Lower lows, higher highs; no sight more beautiful. 

My interpretation? We found the bottom of the bears attack. The news has been consistently saying the squeeze is over but one and at time they are saying their might be a second surge and their reasoning is if retailors see this price drop as a buying opportunity instead of red flags, it will surely send the price up. The logic there is simple: if people are buying stock it goes up, if people are selling, it goes down. 

So today is pure magic. It doesn't need to be a wild swing up to be promising. What it needs to be is slow, consistent buying pressure even during restricted trading. 

But all the shorts covered! Simply not true. That is a fact. All we know is what people are telling us. Melvin says they covered. It will be the third time they have claimed that. Do I think they covered? Yes, I do. Does that matter? No. Now even if Melvin and others covered and the S3 figures are right that means the guess right now is that this stock is still 57% short. Based on their Twitter this isn't including newly opened positions which anyone in their right mind would certainly open a short position when it was 3-400. They thought this bubble would pop and they would make a quick buck. They saw it get down to $85 and started celebrating...but it starting climbing...uh oh.

Truth is, no one will know the real numbers until the 9th. I think it's a little too much tin foil hat to says those numbers will be misconstrued but what we have witnessed over the past few days...it's possible. 

So let's talk about who is currently holding GameStop. Well, a shit ton of degenerates that have lost millions of dollars and seemingly don't give a shit. They are here out of principle, truth be told, so am I. I absolutely refuse to give any shares to the shorts after the crap they pulled last week. So we have a ton of bag holders refusing to sell and a ton of people wondering if now is the time to get in for a potential epic second short squeeze. No one is going to sell at these levels. Some people here and there but it simply isn't worth it, not with so much potential for a second squeeze.

**So when will this second squeeze happen?**

If the newest shorts are smart, it already begun. If I took up a short position and saw this start climbing again after everything it has been through, you better believe I would be covering now while I have profits. Not all of them are going to do this, which is why as the price gradually rises the potential for a larger and larger squeeze is exponential. There is no telling when it will happen. It could be a slow climb for the next couple of weeks before it pops. The 9th will be a huge indicator of what is to come, if that has anywhere above 50% short interest you better believe everyone is going to hop right back into it. It could happen as early as this week. It could be post earnings when Papa Cohen tells us his majestic plans during ER. It could be that ER will actually be fantastic on 03/05 because it will have the console cycle numbers. Look at GME charts in the past, the console cycle always makes the stock pop and with all this attention that very well could be the catalyst.

**In summary**

I wanted to do deeper analysis for you all but I knew some of you were really looking forward to the next post and my thoughts regarding the situation so I wanted to get something out there. In my opinion, a second surge, a second squeeze is bound to happen. This is a buying opportunity for those who missed the first one and I think the market and stock price is reflecting that sentiment. 

Positions:

1100 GME @ $16 closed

500 GME @ $20 closed

50 GME @ $120 open

236 GME @ $250 open

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I have yet to see any indication or good thesis to explain why the short squeeze would be over. Even if Melvin covered and even if S3 numbers are correct at a 57% short, these are indicators of another squeeze, potentially even more epic. The bleeding days of red on Monday and Tuesday I personally think was a combination of panic selling when premarket and ATH didn't blow up due to the ITM calls and phantom shares being created due to consistent FTD's diluting the share price. I do think these FTD's were intentional and what many are perceiving as a short ladder attack is in fact the creation and purchasing of phantom shares driving the price down. If you are a bagholder, I think it wise to hold, if you have already closed your position I would consider what we are witnessing as another buying opportunity.

Final disclaimer. I have already made a significant sum of money on this GME play. This post is not a hope that you will come rescue me from my bagholding status. The money I put back in was money I was willing to lose and I came back in out of principle to stick it to the man.

He was a lawyer living in Seattle, no one aside from a few close family members were aware of his wealth. He was fascinated by the stock market and thought of himself as shepherding over his wealth that would eventually go back to benefit the rest of society.

At least, it is the first time it is happening in front of my eyes and I can actively be part of it.

What is happening has become very serious, but it is experienced with that romanticism and irony that is not often seen in the world of the stock market.

The thing that no one mentions, however, is the incredible contribution that the GME affair is making to global financial culture. Not only are the videos of youtubers explaining what's going on increasing exponentially, but the incredible thing is that even influencers and youtubers completely outside the stock and financial game are talking about it.

The consequence of this is that a lot of people are getting informed, they are trying to understand what is happening, why it is happening, and what are the rules and mechanisms that are permitting this situation.

This wave of information is spreading at lightning speed financial concepts that have always remained obscure to most people.

In short, ordinary people are opening their eyes. Financial education, albeit minimal, is beginning to be part of the cultural baggage of young and old alike. And this will have huge consequences in the future.

This meme, and the whole GME situation, is opening the eyes to the world. I could compare it to the boost that the first trips to the moon gave to space engineering, or the boost to Karate gyms after the success of the movie Karate Kid, or the boost to medical culture that the pandemic that's hitting us is giving.

This, ~~gentlemen,~~ ladies and gentlemen, is the major event that is revolutionizing economic culture from the ground up. And each one of you is a part of it. And each one of you will be able, one day, to proudly say ""f\*\*k money, that time we were the protagonists"".

Be honest: who else would have had such an opportunity to use money as a tool against the powerful market manipulators without GME?

This is why what is happening is not a meme anymore. The world will be different afterwards.

**tl;dr**

The GME Affair is changing the world's financial culture forever. No more financial ignorance, no more ""under the mattress"" investments. No more underhanded economic power plays.

Melvin Capital, the hedge fund run by Gabe Plotkin that struggled with heavy losses last year as it reeled from wrong-way bets on GameStop, is shutting down, according to a letter sent to investors on Wednesday that was reviewed by The New York Times. Mr. Plotkin wrote to his investors that he had decided that the “appropriate next step” was to liquidate the fund’s assets and return cash to all investors. Mr. Plotkin, who founded Melvin in 2014, also wrote that he recognized he needed to “step away from managing external capital.” 

Mr. Plotkin, a protégé of the hedge fund billionaire and New York Mets owner Steven A. Cohen, had wagered that shares GameStop, AMC Entertainment and other mall mainstays from the 1990s would fall as their businesses shrank. Instead, the stocks skyrocketed when amateur investors, coordinating via Reddit, Twitter and other social media sites and determined to outsmart big Wall Street funds, kept buying up shares and propping up their price. That caused Melvin, which had $8 billion in assets under management in January 2021, to lose billions of dollars as it scrambled to cover its so-called short positions. It was propped up by a $2.75 billion bailout from the hedge funds Point72, run by Mr. Cohen, and Citadel, as well as fresh capital from new investors. Before deciding to shutter his fund, Mr. Plotkin had considered reconstituting it. The decision to close Melvin, which Mr. Plotkin named after his late grandfather, is a blow to Mr. Plotkin’s reputation. He had gained fame as one of the most successful portfolio managers to emerge from Mr. Cohen’s former hedge fund, SAC Capital.",20854,1715,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/usojm9/melvin_capital_hedge_fund_torpedoed_by_the/,all,Unknown,0.94

Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines.

Trudeau elected to go ahead with retaliatory tariffs even though Trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if Canada retaliates against the U.S.

President Joe Biden on Wednesday called on U.S. oil refining companies to produce more, saying they need to help alleviate the burden of high prices on consumers. “At a time of war – historically high refinery profit margins being passed directly onto American families are not acceptable,” the president said in a letter to oil companies including Exxon Mobil and Chevron. ″[C]ompanies must take immediate actions to increase the supply of gasoline, diesel, and other refined product,” the letter added. Biden’s call comes as sky-high energy costs add to inflationary concerns across the economy. The national average for a gallon of gas crossed $5 over the weekend for the first time on record, according to AAA. 

The national average now stands at $5.014, which is 54 cents more than a month ago, and $1.94 more than last year. Refiners can’t just ramp up output, with utilization rates already above 90%. Additionally, some refiners are now being reconfigured to make alternate products like biofuel. Refining capacity has dropped since the pandemic took hold, which is a factor in the rapid advance of fuel prices. Demand has returned as economies restart and people travel once again, but supply remains tight.

Still, there is no easy solution. John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital, said refiners are working at historically high level. “There is nothing left to ramp up,” he said. Kilduff noted that no new refineries have been built in decades, but existing units have been expanded. Prior to the pandemic, there had been excess refining capacity, which pressured profits. “Years of sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, and now Russia, has more than contributed to the current situation,” he said. The industry says the administration’s policies are to blame for the surge in prices. “While we appreciate the opportunity to open increased dialogue with the White House, the administration’s misguided policy agenda shifting away from domestic oil and natural gas have compounded inflationary pressures and added headwinds to companies’ daily efforts to meet growing energy needs while reducing emissions,” Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, said Wednesday.",18081,55,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vcxv04/biden_tells_us_oil_companies_in_letter_your_well/,all,Industry Discussion,0.9

Retail Investors demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing. Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know its published with a 1 month delay? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**


We the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data that gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.


**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**


*Filing of Form 13F. A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*


**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions. Why?**

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries extended heavy losses on Wednesday in a sign investors are selling even their safest assets as a global market rout unleashed by U.S. tariffs takes an unnerving turn towards distress and a dash for the safety of cash.

""This is beyond fundamentals right now. This is about liquidity,"" said Jack Chambers, senior rates strategist at ANZ in Sydney.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, the globe's benchmark safe-haven anchor, was up 20 basis points and rising in Asia - a remarkable move in a time zone where it's usually fairly steady.

At 4.46% the yield is up 59 basis points from Monday's low, with traders saying hedge funds were the heaviest sellers as they started to be forced from leveraged bets that in calmer times profit from small gaps between cash and futures prices.

""This kind of thing becomes problematic if the prime broker starts saying that now ... I want to charge you a higher margin or I basically want more margins from you,"" said Mukesh Dave, chief investment officer at Aravali Asset Management, a global arbitrage fund based in Singapore.

Thirty-year U.S. yields spiked 24 bps to 4.9553% and the three-day move in yield - if sustained - would mark the heaviest selloff in the long end since 1981.

Selling was heavy in Japan and Australia.

So basically we are going back to the stone ages tomorrow. This is much much worse than you think...

1jpgdmv,2025-04-02,2025-04-02 00:32:37,"US tourism officials sound alarm, tourist flights to US sink 70% and could impact up to 140k hospitality jobs and $14B in economic spending","Here is my way of trying to find alpha in an erratic stock market - how I'm trading the US tourism dip.

**1. Canada is the US's largest source of tourism**: In 2024, 20 million Canadian tourists visited the US, spent $20.5 billion, and supported 140,000 US jobs. Canada's population is 40 million, so 50% of the entire country visited, and the US had 77 million tourists so 1 country is contributing 26% of visits.

**2. Recent US policies is leading to a tourism boycott from Canadians, and the rest of the world**: Tourists are boycotting US tourism due to tariffs, annexation threats, new travel barriers, and stories of visitors being unlawfully detained with no due process (in March a Canadian citizen was denied entry due to an expired visa, while this was a worker and not a tourist, instead of being allowed to return to Canada, as is the norm, she was shackled in chains and sent to a private ICE facility for 2 weeks without being able to contact a lawyer or get a bed).

**3. Analysts previously predicted policies would decrease tourism by 5%, new numbers released this week show that it's 14x higher:** For Canada alone (26% of US's entire tourism industry with 20 million visitors) - airline travel is **down** **70%**, land travel is **down** **45%**, and **85%+** of tourists survey say they cancelled their US trips.

**4. Here's how I'm planning on using this information to make stock trades into specific companies both long and short:** I'm shorting airlines that have high exposure to Can-US routes (it's been reported that airlines are slashing these routes due to 0 demand, and they is no clear way they can cover this revenue gap with a lower utilized fleet). I'm shorting select hospitality chains (hotels, restaurants) with high exposure/retail foot print in US states that border Canada like Niagara Falls. The US travel association says that even just a 10% dip in tourists will lead to $2 billion in economic losses and 140,000 jobs at risk (assuming 70% decrease from air travel happens across the board, that's $14b), I expect hospitality to have lower revenues. I'm shorting all non-essential or higher price retailers with a big footprint in hostility states, all these workers being laid off by lack of tourism + the gov worker job cuts won't have as much to spend (not my specific trade, but an example would be short Target, long Dollar General).

I'm long, and buying, non-American/Europe hotel chains and travel booking platforms that get most of their revenue outside the US, as I expect Canadian and international tourists to concentrate their spend to Europe/Asia/Oceania travel this summer.

**Edit 5. How do the European/International figures play?**

It's important to note that the Canadian tourism numbers dipped after the policies that happened in point 2. And we're seeing what those numbers are a few months later now. The US admin is rolling out these policies across the board tomorrow during ""Liberation Day"". The point here is that we won't see the true vector of an internal tourism boycott both in terms of magnitude and direction until the policies that were enacted on Canada are enacted globally, and consumers have time to adjust behaviour. But if the Canadian consumer is any indication, I have more conviction in my trades. **A glimpse into this being a trend is a French travel company reporting to Bloomberg their Europe to US travel bookings are down 25%.**

**Edit 6. Example of the airline play**

Yes I know US airlines are already down a lot. Rode that wave and exited my shorts. Now I'm shorting Air Canada and ONEX (parent company of WestJet), since they have much more exposure to US-Can routes, and are cutting routes dramatically with no increase in capacity elsewhere

Also looking to short airline maitence companies, the food suppliers specific to flight food, and fuel refineries/storage those two airlines use, and retail stores with large exposure to airports that only see US/Canada travel.

But going long on regional air craft hangers since their smaller fleets are used the most for US/Canada travel, while their bigger fleets will still be active for the europe/asia flight routes that havn't seen impact on demand.

Would like to hear what everyone thinks about this trade play. Thanks!

1ibkcex,2025-01-27,2025-01-27 16:16:38,"Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history","Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.

The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. 

Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”

The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”

But after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.

Data center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.

For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.

Nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.

CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.

The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.

“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.

Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

le7syu,2021-02-06,2021-02-06 16:53:46,GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float,"DISCLAIMER: This post is NOT Financial Advice!  
  
This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets
  
  
[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

px5pjh,2021-09-28,2021-09-28 08:51:06,Zillow is paying above market price for houses,"A few weeks ago, Zillow offered me $30,000 above market value (in writing) for my house. My house was listed on the MLS and they could’ve offered the sales price if they wanted, but they offered $30,000 over that. A neighbor without a realtor was offered and accepted $75,000 (20%) over market value. I don’t know if the purpose is to put some money into assets to avoid paying taxes, to meet a quota, or simply to manipulate the real estate market. Just thought I’d post this. I used to own Zillow stock but sold it in May.

Edit: For clarification, based on recent comparable sales, I listed my house for sale at $350k, another neighbor behind us with similar square footage for $345k. Then the neighbor across the street with similar square footage (but a lot that’s a little bigger) said she had sold to Zillow for $430k. I contacted Z and they offered me $380k. It’s true that housing market is crazy here and houses are selling above list price in many instances. I just don’t understand why Z offered so much more than market value based on recent sales when the public isn’t offering that much.",15215,2515,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/px5pjh/zillow_is_paying_above_market_price_for_houses/,all,Unknown,0.93
ljr9dr,2021-02-14,2021-02-14 11:14:10,"If you want to be successful don’t get greedy. Remember that bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered.","A colleague just started trading.  I recommended a strong stock I’ve done good DD on but cautioned it will take awhile to see any gains.

A few weeks later it increased 20% on some good news and then dropped 5% for net 15%.  He’s texting me days later “wtf poison_ivey this stock blows, when is it going to take off??”

With all the recent hype some people are looking for X00% overnight and expect massive gains with no effort.  It’s also really hard to sell when something you own is on a crazy run and FOMO creeps in.

The key success here is don’t get greedy.   Take your profits and protect your capital core.  Every stock is different and nothing is ever a sure bet.  Lululemon used to be a really strong buy but took a huge dip a few years back because of allegations against the founder

My average annual return is 20%.  It’s not as sexy as making infinite gains on shorts but it means I will retire a lot sooner than I thought I ever could.  If one of my tickers hits bigger than I thought I reassess value and often I take my book value and use the gravy to ride that train the rest of the way

If you could afford to invest $1k per year you could retire w over a million, and way more if you can increase your annual investment more each year.

Compound interest at a rate of return of 20% after
20 years = $275k ($20k invested @ $1k per year.
25 years = $775k ($25k invested @$1k per year).
30 years = $1.3M ($30k invested @$1k per year).

After 30 years you could retire and earn an annual income of $78k with a passive 6% interest without eroding that core $1.3M.

Start small and be patient.  Decide what percentage of your capital you are willing to go YOLO on and what amount you need to protect to avoid that “holy crap what have I done I’ve lost everything and I’m going to vomit” feeling.

Edit:  I’ve been investing 7 years.  So as many have commented that isn’t long enough to have seen a huge dip and I agree.  I don’t want to mislead.

The point of this post was not to say 20% forever is easy or hard or that everyone should expect that.  The point is to protect your capital and take small risks to learn and build.

Figure out how much pre-tax $$ you need to live every year and divide that by 5%.  That’s what you need to retire.

Try and save some money, move to Latin America (edit: or somewhere else abroad) and teach kids English while living in a much more affordable tropical place. Feeling isolated? Reach out to one person who you would be happy to talk to. There are always solutions. 

I know it’s easy to feel isolated, especially now. But I love each and every one of you, and I don’t even have to know you personally because you are all my brothers and sisters from a cosmic perspective.

When Apple released iOS 14.5 late last month, it began enforcing a policy called App Tracking Transparency. iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV apps are now required to request users' permission to use techniques like IDFA (ID for Advertisers) to track those users' activity across multiple apps for data collection and ad targeting purposes.

The change met fierce resistance from companies like Facebook, whose market advantages and revenue streams are built on leveraging users' data to target the most effective ads at those users. Facebook went so far as to take out full-page newspaper ads claiming that the change would not just hurt Facebook but would destroy small businesses around the world. Shortly after, Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a data privacy conference and delivered a speech that harshly criticized Facebook's business model.

Nonetheless, Facebook and others have complied with Apple's new rule to avoid being rejected from the iPhone's App Store, though some apps present a screen explaining why users should opt in before the Apple-mandated prompt to opt in or out appears.""

**On Wednesday, the movie theater chain launched a new portal on its website just for its retail investors. The site, which requires stockholders to self-identify and sign-up for the chain’s loyalty program, contains “special offers” and company updates.**

One of those special offers is a free tub of popcorn.

AMC’s retail investors have [propped up company since January](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/amcs-ceo-wants-to-use-the-meme-frenzy-as-a-springboard-for-growth.html), sending the stock up more than 1,400% in the last five months. Shares were up more than 20% in premarket trading Wednesday. 

The company said it had 3.2 million individual shareholders as of March 11, who own about 80% of the 450 million shares outstanding. Many of them were inspired by the r/wallstreetbets Reddit page to purchase the stock. The forum selected several companies that were being shorted by large hedge fund groups and decided to take action.

CEO Adam Aron has praised these investors for their support. The company delayed its annual shareholders meeting by more than a month in order to give these investors an opportunity to attend the event and “make their important voices heard.”

Aron and AMC both plan to [donate $50,000 to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/amc-ceo-adam-aron-raved-about-its-reddit-investors-on-an-earnings-call.html) — a clear nod to these new investors, who call themselves apes and refer to Aron as “Silverback.” AMC also has shifted its communication style to speak directly with shareholders via social media, including YouTube. Aron has even taken a renewed interest in Twitter, “following” hundreds of accounts tied to the “ape army.”

AMC Investor Connect is the next step in the company’s strategy of connecting with these investors. The platform provides shareholders with exclusive promotions, like free or discounted items and invitations to special screenings, as well as direct communications with Aron.

“During my five-plus year tenure as CEO at AMC, I’ve taken great pride in the relationships I have forged with AMC’s owners,” Aron said in a statement Wednesday**. “With AMC Investor Connect, that effort in relationship building will continue apace even if our shareholders now number in the millions. After all, these people are the owners of AMC, and I work for them.”**",13990,989,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nqk7qi/amc_to_offer_free_popcorn_and_exclusive/,all,Unknown,0.92

1k5g9yj,2025-04-22,2025-04-22 16:13:09,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.” The company said this “dynamic,” and “changing political sentiment” could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.

Tesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany’s far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company reported a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.

Tesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet’s Waymo. The company has promised to launch its first driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June.

The company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a “pilot launch” in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.

Operating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.

The company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.

Energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is “creating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.”

Tesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said “increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.”

Warren Buffett went on the record Friday to deny social media posts after President Donald Trump shared on Truth Social a fan video that claimed the president is tanking the stock market on purpose with the endorsement of the legendary investor.

Trump on Friday shared an outlandish social media video that defends his recent policy decisions by arguing he is deliberately taking down the market as a strategic play to force lower interest and mortgage rates.


“Trump is crashing the stock market by 20% this month, but he’s doing it on purpose,” alleged the video, which Trump posted on his Truth Social account.

The video’s narrator then falsely states, “And this is why Warren Buffett just said, ‘Trump is making the best economic moves he’s seen in over 50 years.’”",13039,669,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1js3xtr/buffett_denies_social_media_rumors_after_trump/,all,Off-Topic,0.97

Starting pay for hourly crew members will range from $11 to $18 an hour. There are opportunities to advance to general manager positions with average annual pay of $100,000.

Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol said the current labor market is among the most challenging he's seen in his career in the restaurant industry. He cited a range of reasons including child care and a rethinking of work post-pandemic.

As the labor market heats up, Chipotle Mexican Grill announced Monday it's raising pay for restaurant workers, reaching an average of $15 an hour by the end of June.

The company has also introduced employee referral bonuses of $200 for crew members and $750 for apprentices or general managers, as it looks to recruit 20,000 new workers across the country to support its peak season and new restaurant openings.

The pay hike for new and existing restaurant workers, both hourly and salaried, will roll out over the next few weeks, with hourly crew wages starting in the range of $11 to $18 per hour. There are also opportunities to advance to a restaurateur position, which is the highest-ranking general manager, with average compensation of $100,000 a year, Chipotle said, in as little as 3½ years.

Chipotle is getting creative in its hiring initiatives. It is hosting a virtual career fair on Thursday on Discord, the social platform, that will include sessions with current employees. Other Chipotle benefits include mental health care and 401(k) plans and debt-free degrees for workers after 120 days from nonprofit, accredited universities in partnership with Guild Education.

A key difference between the proposals is reportedly that Ossoff's bill includes dependent children — who may have access to the same privileged information as their lawmaking parent — while Hawley's does not. The two also differ on the enforcement mechanism.

Violators of Ossoff and Kelly's bill would be fined the entirety of their congressional salaries. The freshman senator narrowly defeated former Sen. David Perdue last year amid the Georgia Republican's own stock-trading scandal.

On the other hand, Hawley's bill would require violators to forfeit any profits gained from stock-trading directly to the US Treasury.

Whilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).

Tesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq

In China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.

Tesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.

Whilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  Take up of FSD is a lowly 11%.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).

With Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.

Tesla is frankly trading at utterly ludicrous levels given the clear reality of global EV market growth.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would impose 25% tariffs on “all cars that are not made in the United States.”

Trump said in the Oval Office that there is “absolutely no tariff” for cars that are made in the U.S.

Trump on Monday had hinted that the auto tariffs could arrive prior to April 2, the day his sweeping “reciprocal tariff” plan is set to begin.

“We’ll be announcing that fairly soon over the next few days, probably, and then April 2 comes, that’ll be reciprocal tariffs,” he said at a Cabinet meeting.

Trump has long signaled his plans to impose heavy tariffs on foreign trading partners. But his unpredictable and frequently shifting policy rollouts have stirred turmoil in the stock market and left business leaders uncertain about how to plan for the future.

Trump has hyped April 2 as “liberation day” and “the big one.” His plan, as originally described, would slap reciprocal tariffs on all countries that have their own import duties on U.S. goods, while also imposing tariffs in response to other disfavored trade policies, such as the use of value-added taxes.

But Trump and his officials have recently suggested that the tariffs coming April 2 could end up being softer than they first appeared.

Trump said Friday that “there’ll be flexibility” on those tariffs, and on Tuesday night suggested the duties will be more “lenient than reciprocal.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that countries can pre-negotiate with the U.S. to avoid facing new tariffs on April 2.",11299,157,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jkn9bk/trump_announces_25_tariffs_on_all_cars_not_made/,all,Unknown,0.95

It's concerning when fast food and retail businesses start seeing contracting sales from the US consumer. Especially staples that are concerned with affordability like Walmart and McDonalds. If Consumers are pulling back spending on ""cheap"", low cart value items like a McDonalds meal then it signals to me a budget constrained, worried consumer who won't spend on higher price discretionary categories like electronics, home reno, travel, etc.

The flip side of this - other fast food companies like Domino's have been doing fine.

If  you want safety sell your positions and buy ETFs (stable all world,  maybe S&P), maybe go for a dividend stock like T. If you can't  handle your emotions make your portfolio all cash and trade on a paper  account.

And for the love of god  don't call yourself a ""long term investor"" because you are bag holding a  20% loss. It might never come back, may come back tommorow, maybe in 7  years? You never know.

Today bond yields have spiked just as high as they were when Trump enacted his 90 day pause. He clearly cares about this measure given the action he took a few days ago. Could this continued sell off on bonds cause Trump to back off of China? 

According the the FT, ten minutes ago, talking about bond yields today: “They point to a complete loss of faith in the strongest bond market in the world.”

I know I’m the one who asked the question, but in my opinion it seems like there’s a decent chance this will cause Trump to back off, because otherwise this will lead to a much larger crisis, with the U.S losing its reserve currency status and the debt becoming more expensive than whatever we may generate from tariffs.

I highly recommend the commentary below to anyone who wants a simple 3 minute summary of what happened last month.

Some strippers on Twitter said they think recession is guaranteed - because the strip clubs are suddenly empty. On Thursday, a woman who goes by @botticellibimbo on the platform said the following about the clubs: ""The strip club is sadly a leading indicator, and I can promise y'all we r in a recession, lmao."" ""Me getting stock alerts just to decide whether it's worth it to go to work,"" she further wrote in a subsequent tweet. People took to the comment section of her post to confirm her sentiments about the strip clubs, as well as their own experiences in other industries that seemed to be declining. ""Nah fr, reading all these articles journalists and economists are like we're not in a recession we might not even get one this year or next…like the club is dead babe wym,"" one wrote. ""Tbh, I think we've been in a recession since fall 2020,"" another added. A third wrote: ""It's getting expensive out there. It's probably gonna get worse, unfortunately,"" another added.

Someone else, who is a ""mail carrier,"" wrote: ""' I'm a mail carrier and have noticed the lack of volume of packages coming from one of my customers that has a home business. S****'s gonna get worst smh,"" someone added. According to data from the market research group IBISWorld, it estimates that the profit for US strip clubs has declined more than 12 per cent to $1.4bn (£1.2bn) in 2018, which is down from $1.6bn in 2012. The research group also noted that the annual revenue growth at US strip clubs was 4.9 per cent between 2012 and 2017. It eventually slowed down to 1.9 percent from 2013 to 2018 and is projected to face another decrease at 1.7 per cent by 2023.

This guy in here is saying how it’s all smart and trump is trying to do a 20% cut on purpose. He was saying we need to bring these manufacturing jobs here, and said yeah we need to make tires here! I’m not an expert but I’m fairly sure the US has almost no rubber plantations or manufacturing. 

On top of the other issues like the fact that who the fuck would want to work at a rubber plantation? Then he was saying that hopefully all this manufacturing will be back in the US before the tariffs affect prices! 

He was saying that almost all brake fluid is made in the USA which idk how true that is but sounds false, not to mention it doesn’t ask the question of where do the plastic containers or aluminum containers it’s stored in come from? Not to mention the many other auto parts that aren’t made here and won’t be made here.

He is a normal mechanic in a swing state, just seeing the opinion of the everyday person shows me how deep people are into this and they will not accept that this isn’t part of a master plan in their favor. 

I also notice he keeps talking about the “trillions” of dollars that are going to be invested in this country like they would see any of that. It’s just proof that trump announcing these investments literally works perfectly to placate many. 

My prediction is that the stock market continues to shrink until the tariffs are gone at least and that about half the country will be in denial about it.  ",10569,1569,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jtouzf/the_reality_of_whats_happening/,all,Crystal Ball Post,0.94

There was no Tariff “exception” announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff “bucket.” The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us. The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.

**How does it work:**  The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

I had been testing the tool for the past 3 months and had to tweak the program to account for the increased bot activity following the GME hype (remove exact same comments posted multiple times, the same account spamming with one ticker etc.)

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Stock: Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: **73%**

Month on Month increase in mentions: **247%**

Average sentiment across mentions: **+34.6%**

**DD**

**Core Product**

Corsair is the leading manufacturer of high-performance gear and technology for games and PC enthusiasts. Another important part of their portfolio is the brand Elgato which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators, competitive gamers, and streamers. Currently, their products are in high demand and command a significant price premium against other brands.

**Financials**

Corsair currently has a net revenue of $1.7B (55% increase YoY) and a gross profit of 456MM (107% increase YoY). They had 84% increase in the sales of gamer and creator peripherals. Net income is 103MM compared to 8.4MM loss last year.

They had a gross margin improvement of 6.9% (lesser availability of parts allowed them to jack up their margins) and paid off $190MM debt in 2020. (Current debt of $321MM with $133MM cash in hand)

**Potential and Hype Factor**

People are increasingly spending more and more time on video games and Corsair caters to the premium segment in this market. Adding to this, the current explosion in Twitch viewership and Corsair’s marketing strategy of sponsoring famous streamers to showcase their premium gear further adds to the product demand.

The company is also benefitting greatly from the changing landscape due to the ongoing Covid crisis. As more and more people stay home and abstain from their regular hobbies, they have turned to digital entertainment with PC gaming being one of the leading contenders.  In fact, video game consumption is currently at an all-time high and is set to explode even further.

**Risk and Competition**

I see 3 major risk factors for Corsair

a. Supply Constraints: They currently have unmet demand due to supply constraints which benefitted their margins. But a more severe supply constraint can negatively affect their revenue and brand image

b. Return to normal: The current growth rate might not be sustainable once the pandemic is over and people can return to their regular lifestyle

c. One firm owns 80% of the outstanding shares: Corsair is majorly controlled by EagleTree Capital which has majority voting power and an 80% ownership of the company

**Conclusion**

Corsair currently has about 20% market share for gaming peripherals and 40% market share for PC components putting them in an ideal situation to capture any future growth. Although there is some risk in terms of supply constraints and return to normal, their brand, product line, and current financials are put them in a very strong position.

#Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants

###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won’t be easy.

> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”

> Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.

> “We have more demand from across Europe,” says Mathias Nöbauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “Some customers were very explicit,” Nöbauer says. “Especially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.”

> “It's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans’ perspective—that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says Joakim Öhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. “Those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.”

> Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, Öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.

> Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company’s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. “First and foremost, it’s about values,” Cottlehuber says. “For me, privacy is a right not a privilege.” Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. “The best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers’ privacy is respected and preserved,” Cottlehuber says.

> Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always “been a must,” but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. “Since the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,” Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to Nöbauer’s Exoscale.

> Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is “not accurate” that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. “Our customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,” Straight says. “AWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.” Staight says the membership of the PCLOB “does not impact” the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has “additional safeguards for cloud content.” Google and Microsoft declined to comment.

> The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. “We can certainly feel that something is going on,” Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has “beaten” the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. “This is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,” he says.

> While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small—at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services—such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing—from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. “What happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,” he says.

> For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon’s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.

> “If you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you’ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,” says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer “safe” for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can’t properly compete. “We sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,” he says. However, that too could change.

> Schaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. “The dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,” Schaake says. “The idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.”

U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday ordering the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments to create a sovereign wealth fund and said it may purchase TikTok.

""We're going to stand this thing up within the next 12 months. We're going to monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters. ""There'll be a combination of liquid assets, assets that we have in this country as we work to bring them out for the American people.""

Trump had previously floated such a government investment vehicle as a presidential candidate, saying it could fund ""great national endeavors"" like infrastructure projects such as highways and airports, manufacturing, and medical research. 

Details on how exactly the fund would operate and be financed were not immediately available, but Trump previously said it could be funded by ""tariffs and other intelligent things."" Typically such funds rely on a country's budget surplus to make investments, but the U.S. operates at a deficit.

There are over 90 such funds across the world managing over $8 trillion in assets, according to the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds.

TikTok, which has about 170 million American users, was briefly taken offline just before a law requiring its Chinese owner ByteDance to either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19.Trump, after taking office on Jan. 20, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law.

Responding to a growing controversy over investing practices, the Federal Reserve on Thursday announced a ban on officials owning individual stocks and limits on other activities as well. The ban includes top policymakers such as those who sit on the Federal Open Market Committee, along with senior staff. Future investments will have to be confined to diversified assets such as mutual funds. Fed officials can no longer have holdings in shares of particular companies, nor can they invest in individual bonds, hold agency securities or derivative contracts. The new rules replace existing regulations that, while somewhat restrictive, still allowed members to buy and sell stocks. “These tough new rules raise the bar high in order to assure the public we serve that all of our senior officials maintain a single-minded focus on the public mission of the Federal Reserve,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement. Under the new rules, the officials will have to provide 45 days’ notice in advance of buying or selling any securities that are still allowed. They also will be required to hold the securities for at least a year, and cannot buy or sell funds during “heightened financial market stress,” a news release announcing the moves said.

The rules come on the heels of disclosures that multiple Fed officials had been buying and selling stocks at a time when the central bank’s policies were designed to improve market functioning, particularly during the Covid crisis. Regional presidents Robert Kaplan of Dallas and Eric Rosengren of Boston both resigned shortly after disclosures that they had engaged in trading of individual securities last year. In Kaplan’s case, the moves occurred in large-dollar allotments. Vice Chairman Richard Clarida also had been featured in the reports. Powell also sold securities last year, though they were exchange-traded funds that tracked market indexes.",10085,451,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qcxqn0/fed_to_ban_policymakers_from_owning_individual/,all,Unknown,0.97

Looking at the options chain, 25k $50 call options expiring this Friday were purchased today. Assuming that the delta was .5, that is 1.25 million shares that was bought to gamma hedge. Then the price of the GME stocks started to rise causing a chain reaction in MMs covering.

If you look at the $60 call options, 23k were purchased and assuming that the delta on that was .5, that’s another 1.15 million shares that were purchased to hedge. 

Another 17-18k options were purchased between $51-$59, which means around another million shares were purchased during the run up. 

This is entirely assuming that delta on those were .5. If the Delta was higher = more shares were bought.

Temporary replacements have already been working at the company’s cereal plants in Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Tennessee where 1,400 union members went on strike on Oct. 5 as their contracts expired and talks over payment and benefits stalled.

“Interest in the (permanent replacement) roles has been strong at all four plants, as expected. We expect some of the new hires to start with the company very soon,” Kellogg spokesperson Kris Bahner said.

Kellogg also said there was no further bargaining scheduled and it had no plans to meet with the union.

The company said “unrealistic expectations” created by the union meant none of its six offers, including the latest one that was put to vote, which proposed wage increases and allowed all transitional employees with four or more years of service to move to legacy positions, came to fruition.

“They have made a ‘clear path’ - but while it is clear - it is too long and not fair to many,” union member Jeffrey Jens said.

Union members have said the proposed two-tier system, in which transitional employees get lesser pay and benefits compared to longer-tenured workers, would take power away from the union by removing the cap on the number of lower-tier employees.

Several politicians including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have backed the union, while many customers have said they are boycotting Kellogg’s products.

Kellogg is among several U.S. firms, including Deere, that have faced worker strikes in recent months as the labor market tightens.

The comments on social media platform Truth Social came one day after the Fed kept its interest rates unchanged and Powell reiterated that he would wait for greater clarity on how Trump’s tariffs would affect the economy before deciding on a path for monetary policy going forward.

Trump has repeatedly called for the Fed to lower rates. He didn’t repeat that demand Thursday but he did resurface his contention that Powell has a history of moving too late on monetary policy.

Hours after Trump lamented his breakup with Musk and said he was “disappointed” in his former backer and advisor and Musk responded on social media, Trump escalated the feud by threatening to use the U.S. government to hurt Musk’s bottom line. “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on his social media network. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”

m85sp6,2021-03-18,2021-03-18 21:13:07,List of books to read if you want to actually become knowledgeable about stocks and not stay a normie who doesn't know what they're doing,"I'm about to hit you all with some knowledge, so get your big kid pants on! You should read these books in the order they are listed, because they stack up on top of each other and the lessons learned in one are needed to understand the lessons in the next.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor or registered securities analyst.*

*Another disclaimer: If you do not know what exactly a stock is, how to buy or sell a stock or what dividends and earnings are, please look up some crash courses on YouTube or something before starting this list.*

**Let's begin:**

1. **The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle** \- For those of you who don't know, John Bogle is one of the most important people to ever walk this planet when it comes to stocks and investing for the average person. He founded a little company called Vanguard (ever heard of it?) and he also invented the first index fund. In this book, Bogle gives us a primer on the classical approach to passive, conservative and long-haul investing. He goes into the statistics on how around 90% of mutual funds and most people can not beat the market. He makes it clear and simple that if you want to benefit from stock yields over time, you should deploy your money into index funds and sit back while earnings and dividends carry you to wealth. Many people (probably most people to be honest) can stop here and honestly do perfectly fine. The info in this book is all you need to build serious wealth. You will also understand the theory that picking individual stocks is usually a *losers game*. One of the reasons I believe you should read this book first is because the lessons you learn inside of it may show you that the rest of the books on this list may not even be worth reading! If you aren't content with boring old index fund investing though, you can read on..
2. **One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch** \- This book is dated but the principles written in its pages ring true to this day. Peter Lynch is considered one of the most successful mutual fund managers of all time. He achieved returns that beat the S&P 500 for over a decade straight for his investors in the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 70's and 80's. Yes I know I said most people can't beat the market by picking stocks, which is why those who can do it consistently are very special. In this book he teaches you about the tools and strategies he used to achieve those results. It's a great book because it doesn't get too crazy in terms of math and logic, and it's easy to understand.
3. **Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman -** Now it's time to take a break and get into the *psychology* behind stock investing. Let's be honest, we're all pretty stupid and we all have internal biases. These two facts can be serious roadblocks to investing success. The sooner you admit that the better off you'll be. This book will help you understand how to separate your irrational mind from your rational mind when investing and it will make you better at objective decision making.

&#x200B;

\--

Ok, now at this point you have two paths you can take. After these three books you'll have a good grasp on the *theory* and *mindset* to making money in stocks, but you will be lacking the knowledge to actually ***pick individual stocks***. I mean how are you supposed to do that? Just buy whatever is trending on Reddit or what that idiot Jim Cramer on CNBC is talking about? Well as long as you still understand (from book #1) that the odds are against you when picking stocks, you can continue on one of two paths:

**- The Value Investing Path** (Finding, analyzing and buying stocks that are ""undervalued"" and waiting for them to rise back to their fair market value, thus making a ton of money. This is what Warren Buffett does. It's also extremely difficult, boring and requires *rock-solid* emotional stability to ignore the ups and downs of the market.)

\-OR-

**- The Traders Path** (Following market trends and sentiment to find opportunities that can make you money. I personally would not consider this path to be an ""investors"" path. This is a ""speculators"" path, and they are very different. However, you can make money speculating. This could involve shorting stocks or doing a bit of technical analysis, or maybe even playing with some derivatives like options. This path is also extremely difficult and will cause most people to lose *hours* of sleep each night sweating as they panic about their positions)

\--

&#x200B;

If you chose **The Value Investing Path**, continue here:

1. **All of the accounting books you can find** \- You NEED to understand the fundamentals of accounting in order to value businesses. There is no getting around it. Yes, it's boring but if you find yourself enjoying it, you may have an inclination for this. Read everything you can on accounting. Learn to read balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. Learn about assets and liabilities. Do the practice assignments in the books and all of that!
2. **The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham -** This is probably the most famous book on this list, and guess what, you're not going to understand ANY of it. This is the book that Warren Buffett swears by. In fact, Buffett studied with the author of this book when he was a lad. This book is the bible of value investing. Every successful investor knows this book. Within its pages you will learn about what to look for in the stock market, how to understand market behavior, what a good business looks like, how to find the *intrinsic value* of a company, and much much more. I recommend reading this book at least twice and researching everything inside it that you don't understand.
3. **Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman -** Physical copies of this book are extremely expensive, so you're better off finding an online copy (shh don't tell). It's a bit more modern than the title above and it was written by a very successful value investor!
4. **The Dhando Investor by Mohnish Pabrai** **-** Fantastic value investing book that offers some fresh ideas and new things to think about that are built on top of the previous books. Also written by a very successful investor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you chose **The Traders Path**, continue here:

1. **Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefèvre** \- A classic that most traders are told to read at some point in their lives. It teaches so many valuable lessons of reflecting on your wins/losses, psychology of trading, knowing yourself and your weaknesses and more fun stuff. It's an old book but definitely worth reading.
2. **Getting Started in Technical Analysis by Jack Schwager**  \- If you don't know, technical analysis (TA) is the process of finding opportunity by analyzing the market indicators such as price, volume and trends. It ignores company fundamentals and is often seen as a type of voodoo that you either believe in or you don't. I personally am not a fan, however I do recognize the importance TA plays in understanding some stocks at certain times. I do believe that in combination with other metrics, TA can provide valuable insight. This book will teach you the basics.
3. **Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb -** It is not possible to predict the stock market. This book will help you reconcile with that. It will help with understanding how randomness and a bit of luck ties into not only your trading, but your whole life. You will learn about risks and the consequences of taking them.
4. **Market Wizards by Jack Schwager** \- Another great book by the same author as #2 above. This is written in a sort of conversation-like format where the author interviews some of the most successfully traders of the time. There is tons of information in this book on all of the topics we've discussed since it's like you're reading a conversation between two people.

I hope this post will help some of you.

m043o7,2021-03-07,2021-03-07 19:58:21,Advice: Literally the only times I have made large strides in my wealth are during a dip/crash/recession. I can't be the only one excited.,"A lot of people (including my parents and me) suffered after 2008. We often hear ppl losing everything and getting set far back in lives. What we DON'T often hear, are people who loaded up in 2008. Regular average people. Those with small savings. Be it stocks or the housing market (which experienced a trailing small crash 2 years after). Those folks got literally everything on a massive discount.

Think about it from that angle. If I have SOME money saved up now and it were 2008 again, I would be fkin ecstatic. Because after 4-5 years I would gain 1000% easily. And that's not even going into real estate.

Also, recent example of last March will confirm my point. I made huge gains from it. I only bought Costco, Etsy and HomeDepot. No technical analysis. No charts. No graphs. Nothing. They were on sale and I assume people will be using them during the pandemic. Average intelligent move. There was no depth to it.

And even if you don't maximize your portfolio, literally buying any stocks on the dip will make you money in the long run. You can be dense and still make money.

So chill tf out. The dip IS AN OPPORTUNITY. It's a fking GIFT.

We're all familiar with ""buy the dip"". Well, here's the same principles with a minor tweak ""buy the (big) dip"".

There are 3 things for certain: death, tax and the stock market going up in the long run  


EDIT: Based on some of the replies I have to clarify. I am by no mean saying ""THIS IS THE CRASH!"" or ""DON'T INVEST. ONLY DO SO WHEN THERE'S A CRASH!"". I'm merely saying how you should REACT TO/FEEL ABOUT these events. View them as opportunities rather than disasters.

lbzkbi,2021-02-03,2021-02-03 17:00:35,Reminder - Whether you own GME or not - CHANGE YOUR GODDAMN BROKER,"Hello everyone,

Last weekend I created a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?), in which I documented which brokers stopped people from purchasing specific securities, and which ones didn't.

Before it gets forgotten, I want to bring that list back again, and insist that you get a new broker if yours is one of the bad ones.

This is a much, MUCH bigger issue than you think, and this can and WILL affect you eventually, if you stay with a broker that decides that you cannot trade a security that they don't want you to trade. Note that the securities affected were not just meme stocks, several large stocks some of you might own or have heard about were restricted and their price was thus manipulated, including:

- General Motors
- Rolls Royce
- Trivago
- Workhorse Group
- Jaguar Health

And [many more](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html).

When boomer stocks get affected, this means the entire free market is at risk and the next time this happens you might be the one unable to trade your favorite stock if you continue using a bad discount broker. 

**Whether this is the broker's fault or their clearinghouse's fault is irrelevant, the result is your inability to engage in the free market.** This behavior needs to be punished to ensure other brokers don't start doing the same thing.

Here is my list of brokers which I will continue to update, as per the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?):

(Reuters) - Tesla faces a proposed class action claiming it speeds up odometers on its electric vehicles so they fall out of warranty faster, saving Elon Musk's company from having to pay for repairs.

The plaintiff Nyree Hinton alleged that Tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and ""predictive algorithms"" rather than actual mileage driven.

He said the odometer on the 2020 Model Y he bought in December 2022 with 36,772 miles on the clock ran at least 15% fast, based on his other vehicles and driving history, and for a while said he drove 72 miles a day when at most he drove 20.

Hinton, a Los Angeles resident, said this caused his 50,000-mile basic warranty to expire well ahead of schedule, leaving him with a $10,000 suspension repair bill that he thought Tesla should cover.

""By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely,"" the complaint said.

Tesla and its lawyer did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment, but have denied all material allegations in the lawsuit. The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office.

Hinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show.

Tesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city.

The automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges.

In March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action.

The case is Hinton v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 25-02877.",8732,330,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k1p0mo/tesla_speeds_up_odometers_to_avoid_warranty/,all,Company News,0.98

But here's a story you may enjoy.","As mentioned, I've been w/a big Wall Street firm for decades, which means that I have a lot of restrictions on what I can write publicly.  But pretty sure this story is fine, since the company is long gone.

An old, but true, story.  It is represents much of what I went through in the late 1990s, in the midst of the dot com bubble.

eToys was an online toy retailer that did an IPO in January 1999 for $20 per share.  By the end of the day, it closed at $76 per share.

I received a call from a client, who was probably in her late 70s at the time.  She mostly bought blue chip stocks, utility stocks, preferreds, and tax-free bonds.

The conversation went something like this...

Client: SJ, I want to buy a stock.

Me: OK, what are we looking at?

Client: It's called eToys.  They sell toys online.  They are going to be the next Toys R Us, only bigger!

Me: (Looking things over)

Me: You know, they did their IPO at $20 and the stock is now at $80?

Client: I know, they're doing very well!

Me: The stock is doing very well, but I'm not sure that the company is doing too well.  They are new and unproven and they don't have anything resembling a profit or net income.  Why do you want to buy this thing?

Client: My son-in-law recommended it.  He is a very smart young man!

Me: Well, he may be smart, but I also know that son-in-laws can get you in a lot of trouble.  How many shares are you considering?

Client: I want to buy 1,000 shares!

Me: That's $80,000! (A lot of money now, but really a lot back in the late 1990s).

Client: I know.  I have a lot of confidence in eToys and in my son-in-law!

Me: Can I talk you out of buying this stock?

Client: No, I've made up my mind.

Me: Are you open to a compromise?

Client: What do you have in mind?

Me: Instead of buying 1,000 shares of eToys, let's buy 50 shares instead.

Client: 50 shares?  But that's only $4,000!

Me: I know, but I'll feel a lot better watching you lose $4,000 than I would if you lost $80,000.

(Long pause)

Client: Ok, do it.  Buy me 50 shares of eToys!

I bought the shares, the company went bankrupt, and she lost all of her money.  But again, a $4,000 loss beats the heck out of an $80,000 loss!

1kovw6j,2025-05-17,2025-05-17 11:39:13,Trump tells Walmart to 'eat the tariffs' instead of raising prices,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Walmart should ""eat the tariffs"" instead of blaming duties imposed by his administration on imported goods for the retailer's increased prices.

His comments were in response to the world's largest retailer saying this week it would have to start raising prices later this month due to high tariffs.

""Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,"" Trump said in a social media post.

""Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' and not charge valued customers ANYTHING.""

A representative of Walmart could not be immediately reached for comment.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday the retailer could not absorb all the tariff costs because of narrow retail margins. Even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise - which primarily comes from China - would not drive food prices higher.

Many U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of friction between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China, as consumers curtail spending.

As a bellwether of U.S. consumer health, Walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low.

Every week, some 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a Walmart.

Walmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that Amazon planned to disclose how much Trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products. The White House blasted Amazon over the report, which the company promptly denied.

(Bloomberg) — President Donald Trump would put the credibility of the dollar on the line and destabilize the US economy if he fired Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, French Finance Minister Eric Lombard warned.

“Donald Trump has hurt the credibility of the dollar with his aggressive moves on tariffs — for a long time,” Lombard said in an interview published in the La Tribune Dimanche newspaper. If Powell is pushed out “this credibility will be harmed even more, with developments in the bond market.”

The result would be higher costs to service the debt and “a profound disorganization of the country’s economy,” Lombard said, adding that the consequences would bring the US sooner or later to talks to end the tensions.

Lombard’s comments come after Trump, frustrated with Powell’s caution to cut US interest rates, posted on social media Thursday that Powell’s “termination couldn’t come quickly enough.” It wasn’t clear whether he meant he wanted to fire Powell or was eager for the end of his term, which is May 2026. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday Trump was studying whether he could fire him.

President Emmanuel Macron has opposed Trump on a series of issues including Ukraine, trade and even offered refuge in France for US-based scientists whose federal research funding has been cut.

Even so, Lombard’s comments are unusually direct about US domestic matters.

On tariffs, France’s finance minister said the 10% tariffs Trump has imposed on imports from the EU don’t constitute “common ground” and that Europe’s goal is for a free trade zone with the US.

The 10% level is “a huge increase that isn’t sustainable for the US economy and represents major risks for global trade,” Lombard said.

The finance minister also called on European CEOs to show “patriotism” and work with their governments so the region doesn’t lose out.

On Thursday, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, whose group LVMH owns Champagne labels like Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot as well as Hennessy Cognac, seemed to suggest that EU leaders weren’t pushing hard enough for an accord on tariffs.",8273,415,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k36tep/firing_powell_would_hurt_the_dollar_and_us/,all,Broad market news,0.96

nanrlu,2021-05-12,2021-05-12 08:43:30,I analyzed 9000+ trades made by Members of the U.S. Congress in the last two years and benchmarked it against S&P500. Here are the results.,"**Preamble:** The ability of Congress to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is

**Did Congress members** **beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**

**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com

Massive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Congress trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)

While Congress members are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the members in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. 

a.            One Month

b.            One Quarter

c.             Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

**Returns made by the Congress**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.55%|2.42%|0.12%|
|One Quarter|8.76%|7.42%|1.34%|
|Till Date|32.40%|26.40%|5.99%|

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Congress did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.

**Returns if you followed their trades (after the disclosure)**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.0%|2.48%|\-0.48%|
|One Quarter|10.46%|7.89%|2.57%|
|Till Date|29.62%|23.73%|5.89%|

If you had invested in the stocks Congress bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Congress usually plays the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession
2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress.
3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion:**

This analysis proves that Congress indeed gets a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader’s judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

The announcement reflects a firm stance from Beijing amid elevated trade tensions.

Chinese officials have also denied that any current negotiations are taking place, despite recent comments from U.S. leadership suggesting progress. In addition to reiterating their demand for tariff removal, China has introduced new export restrictions and initiated cases at the World Trade Organization.

Tariffs between the two countries now reach as high as 145% on U.S. imports from China and 125% on Chinese imports from the U.S.

* Canada, Mexico tariffs threaten to upend auto, energy sectors

**Thoughts:** We will literally see a decision from Trump tonight regarding whether or not oil will be exempted from the tariffs, otherwise the stocks I'm watching on the OVERNIGHT exchange are F/GM/TM and TSLA/LCID (stands to lose rather than gain if oil is exempted) in addition to all the oil stocks that are standard (OIL, BP, XOM, etc). We might also see some volatility tomorrow at the open, VIX has already spiked but went back to preannouncement levels.

~~EDIT: TARIFFS ARE DELAYED UNTIL MARCH 1ST~~

# [EDIT 2: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TARIFF DELAY HAS BEEN DEBUNKED, STILL CONTINUING ON SATURDAY ACCORDING TO WH PRESS SECRETARY ](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/north-america-braces-new-trump-tariffs-saturday-deadline-nears-2025-01-31/)

>President Donald Trump President Donald Trump said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

>“We’ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.

>“Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,” he said.

>West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day’s high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.

>Trump indicated the 25% rate could represent a floor, saying that the tariff levels “may or may not rise with time.”

>But the US president did suggest he was still considering if one significant import — oil — would be exempted. Trump said would be making a determination as soon as Thursday evening, basing his decision upon the price of oil.

>“We don’t need the products that they have. We have all the oil that you need. We have all the trees you need,” Trump added, referring to major imports from Canada.

>Trump’s move was closely anticipated by markets as well as global business and political leaders who have scrutinized his words and actions for any indication on whether the US president would deliver on his levy threats or use them as the starting point for negotiations on trade.

>Trump in recent days threatened and then pulled back on tariffs against Colombia in a dispute over deportations of undocumented migrants, leading some to speculate that he was using trade levies merely as leverage to seek policy concessions.

>Trump also indicated that he would proceed with tariffs on China. He didn’t specify the levy, though he’s previously said it would be 10%. Trump has said Beijing failed to follow through on promises to prevent fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly drugs from flowing into the US.

>“With China, I’m also thinking about something because they’re sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they’re causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,” Trump said Thursday. “So China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we’re in the process of doing that.”

>Trump has ordered his administration to investigate whether China complied with a trade deal struck during his first term, setting the stage for tariffs against the world’s second largest economy.

>Following through on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, who are US neighbors, major trading partners, and export markets, threatens to have dramatic economic consequences, rattle markets and potentially launch a trade war by undermining protections from a three-nation free trade agreement.

>Both countries have pledged to respond to any trade levies, including with retaliatory tariffs, even as their leaders sought to assure the US they were addressing border concerns in a bid to defuse the conflict.

>“If these tariffs go into effect, Canada will respond,” Canadian Ambassador to the US Kirsten Hillman said Thursday. “This is not something that we want to do. We do not want to get into a tariff-back-and-forth with the United States. It’s not good for Canada, Canadians and Canadian workers and it’s not good for the United States, Americans and American workers.”

>Hillman said that Canada has responded to Trump’s concerns about the border by clamping down and announcing new security measures, including added drones and helicopters.

>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort even before the president was inaugurated in a bid to ease tensions between their nations, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke to Trump to try to avert the levies.

>In the first 11 months of 2024, US trade with Canada totaled $699 billion and $776 billion with Mexico. And the magnitude of tariffs Trump will enact could have stark impacts on particular industries, such as the auto industry and the energy sector. Shares of US automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. turned negative on the announcement, erasing earlier gains.

>“President Trump’s tariffs will tax America first,” Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. “From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose.”

>Trump is also promising sectoral tariffs, such as on pharmaceuticals, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum and copper, which could apply widely to many countries, including Canada and Mexico.

>The US president is an avowed believer in tariffs, saying they will force a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, though industry groups warn that it will upend supply chains and endanger existing factories by raising costs of source materials.

>He’s hailed tariffs as a source of revenue as lawmakers move to renew and expand expiring tax cuts and approve other credits and benefits the president promised on the campaign trail. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for firms that manufacture goods in the US, compared to the current 21% rate.said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

qamr6g,2021-10-18,2021-10-18 09:31:31,The wealthiest 10% of Americans own a record 89% of all U.S. stocks,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/the-wealthiest-10percent-of-americans-own-a-record-89percent-of-all-us-stocks.html

The wealthiest 10% of Americans now own 89% of all U.S. stocks, a record high that highlights the stock market’s role in increasing wealth inequality. The top 1% gained over $6.5 trillion in corporate equities and mutual fund wealth during the Covid-19 pandemic, while the bottom 90% added $1.2 trillion, according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve. The share of corporate equities and mutual funds owned by the top 10% reached the record high in the second quarter, while the bottom 90% of Americans held about 11% of stocks, down from 12% before the pandemic. The stock market, which has nearly doubled since the March 2020 drop and is up nearly 40% since January 2020, was the main source of wealth creation in America during the pandemic — as well as the main driver of inequality. The total wealth of the top 1% now tops 32%, a record, according to the Fed data. Nearly 70% of their wealth gains over the past year and a half — one of the fastest wealth booms in recent history — came from stocks.


“The top 1% own a lot of stock, the rest of us own a little,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow, Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The growing concentration of wealth comes despite millions of new investors coming into the stock market for the first time during the pandemic, leading to what many have labeled “the democratization” of stocks. Robinhood added more than 10 million new accounts over the past two years and now has more than 22 million — many of them held by younger, first-time investors. Yet while the market may be owned more broadly, the gains and wealth it creates are not being more widely distributed. Rosenthal said that while the army of new investors may be numerous, they are also still small, with the average account size at Robinhood at about $4,500. When markets rise, they will have far smaller dollar gains than wealthier investors with hundreds of thousands or even millions in stock holdings.


“Many of the younger investors also bought in at higher prices, compared to bigger investors who have been in the market for years and see larger gains,” Rosenthal said. What’s more, many of the new investors have more of a trading mentality — buying and selling stocks rapidly, with leverage, in hopes of quick gains. While the strategy can create big winners, others may see lower returns than those of investors who simply buy and hold for the long term. The top 10% saw the value of their stocks gain 43% between January 2020 and June of 2021, according to the Fed. The bottom 90% saw stock wealth rise at a lower rate — 33%. “They might account for a larger share of trading activity, but that’s different from ownership and wealth,” Rosenthal said.",8096,835,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qamr6g/the_wealthiest_10_of_americans_own_a_record_89_of/,all,Unknown,0.95

qi92fg,2021-10-29,2021-10-29 05:39:43,"I made $500,000 trading stocks and options in 18 months. These are the 15 things I did that worked best.","I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I’d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back.  It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don’t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. 

**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**

The sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it’s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.

Last year’s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don’t bet against this trend, it’s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I’m dirt. 

Last year you couldn’t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. 

One of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don’t overpay for the options, it works. I don’t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I’m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.

**Make The VIX Your Friend**

The VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It’s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. 

Another interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don’t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I’ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. 

**Selecting Trades & Investments**

**Have an Allocation Plan**

The first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:

* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.
* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It’s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.
* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.
* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. 
* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It’s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I’ll let you know in 10 years if it works.
* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  
* 1% in other things I can’t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.

**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**

Unless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. 

I’ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. 

My favorite tools to use are Zack’s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack’s VGM measures a stock’s value, growth rate, and momentum. It’s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what’s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. 

The list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.

A friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don’t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there’s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it’s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   
I use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn’t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it’s because there’s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&P but haven’t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they’d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn’t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.

I use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.

Fidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.

**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**

If you’ve invested actively for a while, you’ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. 

I’ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What’s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. “Goldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode”), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. 

I am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.

**Good Things Come in Pairs**

Just about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I’ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it’s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. 

Similarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it’s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.

**Exercise Financial Discipline**

Even when I’ve been successful picking investments, I’ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We’ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That’s usually the moment I’ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:

1. Take Profits Often.   
When an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  
If you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn’t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  

2. Fail Fast.   
If the option price sinks to -50% in value, it’s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there’s negative news driving this, I’m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  

3. Profit Both Ways.   
If a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year’s returns for Visa.  

4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   
I have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should’ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  
On the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don’t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don’t chase the perfect trade. It’s a white whale. Just make money.  

5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   
This is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That’s why it’s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn’t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   
So if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there’s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",7970,718,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qi92fg/i_made_500000_trading_stocks_and_options_in_18/,all,Advice,0.85

I distinctly remember buying a few shares at $57 figuring I'd get in on the ground floor of what was already a culturally-significant company. 

Amazingly, over 7 years later the stock is trading lower than where I bought it all those years ago. TWTR has never paid a dividend or split their stock, so in effect they've created zero wealth for the general public over their entire public existence. I sold my shares for a wash in 2014, but I'd have been shocked to hear they'd still be kicking around the same spot in 2021. In an era of social media, digital advertising and general tech dominance, it's a remarkable failure.

On the one hand it provides a valuable lesson that a company still has to succeed financially, and not just have a compelling narrative. Pay attention to the bottom line - hype alone does not a business make. On the other hand, what the hell? Twitter has created verbs. It's among the most-visited websites in the world. We've just had 4 years of a Twitter presidency. Yet Twitter has seen its younger brother (SQ) lap it in terms of value.

ipp3e9,2020-09-09,2020-09-09 17:02:19,Don't be fooled. This IS The Market Crash: My DD.,"I've been researching this a LOT lately because I didn't want to get caught in it. Looking at trends and past data. I believe, strongly, that we're in the middle of the market crash. I used my knowledge and was able to fully exit my entire $500k portfolio on Tuesday, maintaining all my gains. I've even taken a sizeable position in SPY puts ($50k worth of Dec $260). I got my close friends out (well the ones who listened) on Friday at the first sign of positive movement.

First of all, a little history lesson on the [Minksy Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment#/media/File:Stylized_Minsky_Cycle.PNG). It's basically a theory for how market bubbles happen. It occurs in 5 steps. I will outline what they are in basic and how the current market looks in relation.

1. **Displacement**: This is the beginning of a new paradigm where the market changes in a big way. For this, that was the Coronavirus. This took place between February to April.
2. **Boom**: Increase in spending begins and major gains start to be made. Media attention and market involvement begin to increase. Currently, we've seen a HUGE increase in retail traders (who are extremely volatile) and massive media attention toward the stock market as it relates to corona news as well as stimulus and recovery speed gains. This took place between April and July.
3. **Euphoria**: People stop caring about any sort of reasonable investment strategy and just start throwing money at stuff. Tesla is a fantastic example of this, but many other stocks in the tech sector are guilty of this. July was the beginning of this phase as Tesla saw insane growth within a few week period and other companies followed suit very quickly. This continued into late August with Apple and Tesla going to stupid prices after their splits, and all the other big tech names reaching wild valuations.
4. **Profit Taking**: Smart money starts withdrawing funds from the market as they prepare for the crash. We are seeing [record insider selling](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/investing/insider-selling-stocks-market/index.html), but most publicly, it began with Tesla announcing they would sell $5bn in [new shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/tesla-to-sell-up-to-5-billion-in-stock-amid-rally.html). Their second biggest shareholder then announced they were conveniently ""[rebalancing](https://fortune.com/2020/09/04/tesla-stock-rally-investors-selling-outlook/)"" their portfolio to sell many Tesla shares as well. This was nothing more than a ploy to pull money out without crashing the market, even though it did anyway. I will get more in depth on this phase later. The biggest catalyst was [Softbank](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-dives-6-u-tech-004748400.html), though, and that leads me to the final stage.
5. **Panic Selling**: This is when people start to exit en masse in order to recoup whatever they can. We are currently witnessing this. The last few days have been a trainwreck on the market, wiping out August's gains entirely.

Now I know you want to say ""well look at today. We're up 2% in the S&P!"" This is par for the course on a crash. With the Corona crash, these were the rough day to day movement patterns (I'm using Corona as an example for its shortness/simplicity but all crashes have similar patterns):

* 1 small loss day 
* 2 BIG loss days 
* 3 medium loss days 
* 5 ***gain days*** (there were 5 days of gains in the middle of the March crash) 
* 1 GIANT loss day 
* 3 Sideways days 
* 8 slightly down days, leading to the bottom 

Of those gain days, the first was a slowdown, but the second was a change of 4.8% in S&P/SPY from an open of 294 to a close of 309. Consecutive, positive days occurred during every major crash. We can see that being mirrored today and will likely see more upward mobility before more big money starts exiting. Don't be fooled by positive days. That does NOT indicate the crash is over. Novices tend to think crashes are a short event and that they should hold through them because they missed the boat. Crashes take weeks, minimum, but **usually months, if not years**, to become fully realized. Covid's crash is the fastest we've had at one month.

Another trend I've noticed is that these market bubbles are happening and recovering faster and faster. The late 80's Japanese market crash took 6 years to play out. The 2000 dotcom bubble was 4 years. The Chinese 2007 bubble took 2 years. The 2008 oil bubble took 1 year. On the flipside, the 2007 housing bubble took 5 years. The 2008 energy bubble took 3 years. We're about 6 months into this current bubble, but more if you account for any forming bubble from before covid. Maybe this means nothing, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Bubble analysts always say there is a warning sign prior to a true collapse. I've been seeing these called ""violent shake-offs."" Most crashes get one, but some get two. We had one with the June mini-crash. One could argue that this current crash could be a violent shake-off. I'll get to the alternate scenario later. Assuming it's not, which I don't think it is, we move to the final trigger, the catalyst.

**Catalysts**: These are are things required to trigger a bubble collapse. Almost every bubble has had some notable catalyst(s) to trigger the rapid decline. As mentioned in Profit Taking, we've had three catalysts occur so far that triggered panic selling. New Tesla shares, secondary Tesla offloading, and Softbank. They are the big one and who I will focus on for a minute.

To those who don't know, Softbank bought $4 billion in options during the early days of the market post-covid. These options are worth a fortune right now ($30bn estimated), but they have to be sold in order to be fully capitalized on. What everyone is afraid of is Softbank doing just that, or worse, for shareholders: holding through a market crash and losing it all. In the movie, Margin Call (great movie), a hedge fund got wind of the housing market crash before everyone else and ultimately sold EVERYTHING they had in order to get ahead of it, single handedly beginning the inevitable market crash. To be fair, this is a fictional movie and they had a portfolio of like a trillion, but it's really just mentioned to illustrate my point. Softbank has to exercise these options, which have strike prices likely WAY below market value. If they sell those shares, they could easily double their investment, even through a crash. The problem is that people got so spooked by this revelation that Softbank lost over $15 billion in market cap (currently at $112bn). Had this not happened, the speed at which we decline would've been much slower. They have to make those losses up now. You know what would do that? Exercising all their options and selling them for market gains.

They can't keep those options forever, either. At best they have 2 years. Softbank will try very hard to sell all those off without crashing the market, but if it keeps dipping, they will become more desperate and start selling them more frantically, promoting a panic selling cycle. And what are we in? A panic selling cycle.

If this cycle continues with Softbank, more will tack on and we'll see this bubble continue to collapse. If it can hold a recovery this week, it might survive, but of course, I don't think it will. The end of day today really showed that people *are* afraid and that given any opportunity, selloff will occur. I think this IS the crash. But, I could be wrong. That brings me to the second and third catalysts.

**Commercial Real Estate Crash**: The eviction crisis is a real threat to our economy. It's brushed under the rug pretty heavily, pointing to the home real estate market and its gains, but the damage is done. Most major commercial real estate buildings, especially apartments, are in disarray. Go look around and see the kinds of deals your local apartments are offering. Where I am, I'm seeing up to 2 months of free rent in some places. I've never seen that before. Everyone is desperate for paying tenants. Most commercial properties can weather a bit of this kind of thing, but we haven't seen anything like this. Small businesses are shutting down, new businesses are not opening. No one is shopping. Who replaces those lost tenants? All these properties are heavily in debt. That's how the industry works, for the most part. Entrepreneurs and builders finance all projects because they are seen as very safe and it's a rule of thumb to never use your own money for investment. The margins had become abysmal before corona. I once looked into buying commercial real estate and found that I would only cover the expenses and have to solely rely on the property value increasing, to make anything worthwhile. This will cause properties to bleed out extremely fast. There is a commercial real estate collapse coming, likely within 6 months, and it will compound any damage the tech bubble has done. Don't forget that this isn't strictly a US problem. This is a worldwide problem.

**Vacation Industry Crash:** Many countries around the world rely on a steady influx of visitors in order to keep their businesses afloat. This, in turn, boosts GDP. Malaysia, for instance, is a place I personally visited, during Covid, and it was a desolate wasteland. Most shops had employees literally standing outside waiting for a single customer. It was like this for blocks and blocks. Huge tourist attractions were completely devoid of people. It's only a matter of time before our lack of flying catches up to these already poor and extremely hard to maintain businesses. The country in Malaysia I visited had a notoriously low success rate for new restaurants, during the best of times. Now, they are lucky to get any customers. That affect will bleed into the second catalyst. More businesses going under, causing commercial real estate to lose tenants with no one to replace them, causing those buildings to go under, causing banks to be stuck with a boat load of vacant, unprofitable properties, causing them to go under.

Even with a vaccine, we won't go back to normal fast enough to recover the losses. The airline industry is reporting that they don't estimate returns to normal until late 2021, early 2022. Do you think a random Joe has enough liquidity to keep his business running that long at extreme drought? The people at the bottom of the chain, consumers and small business owners, were never prepared to have a cash supply on hand for this kind of hit to their lives. That *is* going to trickle up to the top and when it does, goodbye market.

Of course, there's also the US election, but that will be a small catalyst as far as I'm concerned.

\------------------------------------------------

Other notable indicators/insights that things don't look good:

1. Market cap to GDP was 2:1 at peak. The dotcom crash was 1.4 and the recession was 1.1. Currently 1.77:1.
2. Google trend results for ""Market Crash"" are trending up. Last week, which only accounted for 3 days, really, already topped the June mini-crash.
3. An [analyst](https://www.ft.com/content/9d12ae03-2f6b-4028-8464-e305269e7ee3) who witnessed the Japanese crash of the 1980's believes this will be the biggest crash we've ever seen.
4. EVs are the new dotcom company. Many will fail as car creation proves to be more difficult than anticipated.
5. High growth, high revenue companies do not automatically equate to sustainable companies, despite stock prices pretending they do. For example, Sea Ltd. doubled revenue but also doubled expenses in Q2 2020. eToys is a prime example of this, from the dotcom bust era. Had huge revenue, but their expenses could not be lowered to a sustainable level and went out of business, despite the business model making sense and the revenue stream looking really good.
6. The PE ratio of the market is above 30, which has historically always resulted in a market crash.
7. Apple saw 12 million shares exited at the bell today. Prior to that was around 600k peak. This happened for MOST tech stocks.
8. If you bought Microsoft at peak dotcom bust, you would have to wait 10 years to breakeven (longer if you account for inflation losses). That kind of stagnation is what we're looking at, even today.

\------------------------------------------------

This does NOT mean the entire market will crash. Quite the contrary. Yes, most stocks will go down as the market collapses in overvalued sectors (TECH) brings down the whole thing, but they will stay high if priced fairly. Most epicenter is priced within a reasonable area, for instance, and will weather the storm quite well. At least, until the commercial real estate market collapse catches up to them.

Plan accordingly, set stop losses, and do your own research. I don't expect you to just follow my information blindly. I may have gotten things wrong or mixed some wires. You need to figure this out on your own and make your own judgement call. I simply hope to raise awareness for what I believe is a market crash so that people don't lose their shirt during this. I hope I'm wrong, though I'm literally betting with my money that I'm not.

But there was a big obstacle: Peter Navarro, Trump’s tariff-loving trade adviser, who was constantly hovering around the Oval Office.

>Navarro isn’t one to back down during policy debates and had stridently urged Trump to keep tariffs in place, even as corporate chieftains and other advisers urged him to relent. And Navarro had been regularly around the Oval Office since Trump’s “Liberation Day” event. 
>So that morning, when Navarro was scheduled to meet with economic adviser Kevin Hassett in a different part of the White House, Bessent and Lutnick made their move, according to multiple people familiar with the intervention.

>They rushed to the Oval Office to see Trump and propose a pause on some of the tariffs—without Navarro there to argue or push back. They knew they had a tight window. The meeting with Bessent and Lutnick wasn’t on Trump’s schedule.

>The two men convinced Trump of the strategy to pause some of the tariffs and to announce it immediately to calm the markets. They stayed until Trump tapped out a Truth Social post, which surprised Navarro, according to one of the people familiar with the episode. Bessent and press secretary Karoline Leavitt almost immediately went to the cameras outside the White House to make a public announcement. 

So the Liberation Day steep tariff percentages were only put on a 90-day pause because Navarro was in a different room on that April 9th morning

**Has the Squeeze Been Sqoze? Absolutely not**

**Will the squeeze be sqoze? Potentially** 

**Strap in. This is going to be exhaustively long, but I have a lot to say.**

**Please** see my other work. I'm not here to convince anyone of anything. I am not a shill, I am not here for confirmation bias, I am a pragmatic, neutral party. Anyone who calls me a shill in the comments certainly cannot read and did not do their proper DD on **me.** If you read my previous works dating back 3 months ago you will see how terrifyingly accurate I have been thus far. Even in Part 5 I nearly perfectly predicted all of Friday's entire movements. 

**Note:** That does not mean I will remain accurate for the entire duration of this saga. I also am not saying all of this to flex, it's because I am tired of being called a shill when I was the original predictors of this squeeze and have since provided logical thought that has been proven accurate. This doesn't mean you should take what I am saying as truth, but it does mean that if it doesn't align with your thoughts you should probably put down the kool-aid, loosen up the tin-foil hat, and listen to someone else's opinion so you can make the best decisions for yourself.

I am not a financial advisor, in fact, this isn't even advice. It is simply my analysis of the situation as it has always been. One thing you will find different with my work than others is my research is changing as the landscape changes. If people are still screaming about the original tactic and not acknowledging the new landscape we are in, please be very cautious of making financial decisions based on what these people have to say. 

**I also want to make it crystal clear that I think the squeeze has not been sqoze, however, the landscape is very different now.**

Finally, any PT’s including support and resistance are beyond difficult to predict. Please do not take these as certain numbers. It’s the guess right now and that very well could change as soon as the market opens Monday.

# So What Happened Friday?

For the sake of this not being an entire novel, I encourage you to read Part 5 as I think that prediction is precisely what happened. To summarize, we saw a bulltrap open us up in the morning and we ran to  the 135 resistant point, volume wasn't enough and we tested in twice before people realized we would not be able to break through, that's when selling and more shorting occurred. The price dipped down to around 88. Now, I didn't mention this in the DD but I did mention it in the comments section that I expect interesting price action around 2pm. Why? Because of the call options expiring ITM. 

I think these shares were already covered. I know we expect a higher price increase, but why? Where is the math to back that the price should go higher during these covering sessions? 

Total Options That Expired On 02/26 ITM: **22,713** [Data from here](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?moneyness=allRows)

This would equate to **2,271,300** shares 

At **13:02** the price fell to **\~86,** this was the bottom before the upswing at the end of the day. By **13:07** there was a volume of over **20,000,000** in the buying direction. 

Not 5 minutes after we found the bottom for the day there was nearly 9x the amount of volume required for every single one of these options to be covered. 

At **13:07** alone there was a positive net change in volume of **17,656,000** nearly 8x the amount of volume required for every single one of these options to be covered...within 1 minute. 

The rest of the day continued to uptrend where we saw the price rise back to **\~121**. Then it began falling off again, as did volume. 

Now, ask yourself...why would this be the case? Because none of the price increase at the end of the day was organic purchasing, this was the ITM calls being covered. 

*At this point I'm sure you're ready to stop reading and call me a shill, but I encourage you to carry on so we may understand what comes next. This may not fit your narrative, and that's ok. A squeeze is possible, it might just be time to think that it won't be happening quite the way you imagined.*

# Before we move on to what comes next, let's play with a few more numbers and talk about this idea of holding. 

For some reason, people still believe that holding your shares is preventing HF's from covering. I cannot express how untrue this sentiment is. Holding is a valid play, but it absolutely **should not** be an attempt from keeping your shares from being bought by shorts. A 5 second look at any chart could show you there is **more than enough** sell volume for shorts to get their shares elsewhere if you are not willing to part with them.

Let's take the largest post on r/gme as an example.

The top post of all time received **59,600** upvotes. According to the comments most people are actually holding only about 1-10 shares each. But for the sake of the argument let's get ridiculous and say every one of those upvotes has someone who owns **100** shares of GME. Let's also assume every single one of these shares have been restricted from being borrowed to really screw these guys.

That's a total of **5,960,000** shares that are being tucked away so HF's can't get their grubby little paws on them. On Friday alone, **91,960,000** shares were exchanged. So even in the most ridiculous of circumstances there were plenty of other sellers for shorts to purchase their shares back from. 

Holding is certainly a valid play, but there are two things holding certainly does not do:

1. It does not increase the price of a stock
2. It does not prevent HF's from covering

If you are holding solely because of these two reasons, then you are playing this wrong. There are three reasons to actually hold:

1. You absolutely do not want to sell at a loss and you believe the short squeeze is imminent, so you are patiently waiting for it to occur.
2. You are already positioned extremely well like DFV who has a cost basis of 26.7896
3. You are long on the company and the squeeze is just icing on the cake, you can shut off your computer for a year with no concern and come back to know that you are profitable. 

**If you don't believe me, then please examine the evidence.**

When you purchase a stock the price goes up, when you sell a stock the price goes down. So what happened when RH restricted trading? The price plummeted. Why? Because holding and selling were the only options.

Let's play another absurd game and pretend that 100% of shareholders held when trading was restricted. The price would have gone completely sideways, it would not have gone up or down.

But let's be realistic, that will never happen. Even if retail traders decided to hold, institutions certainly are not running around screaming that they are diamond handed apes who would rather go bankrupt before giving their shares up. No, no. They are going to take their profits and they will do so at your expense. You call them allies which they are not, they are here for profits as we all are and they will gladly sell with 100% gains while everyone else is waiting for 10,000% gains.

I want to pause for a moment in this DD and take a moment to point something out. Even though I'm not trying to convince anyone to sell, I have been called all sorts of names as though I'm evil for offering my opinion and analysis of the situation. But let's be absolutely clear. **You are the ones peer pressuring people into holding. You are the ones trying to convince people of your narrative. You are the ones who will be responsible when someone takes their life if this does not go the way you hope.** 

If you have made it this far, congratulations, I would love to have a discussion regarding the ""hold"" play and how people could argue this is a viable tactic for any of the reasons not outlined above. 

# My Thesis

My thesis remains the same, **the shorts want a short squeeze.** Yes, this sounds absolutely absurd but they are already making a fortune off of this. They need to as most of them lost a lot of money on the first round. They are reporting their losses publicly...but they have not disclosed their gains. 

I think they are intentionally opening unfavorable short positions in order to trigger a squeeze. They open and immediately begin to cover creating the much needed buying pressure that triggers FOMO and market purchasing as well. This allows the price to soar and they absolutely do not intervene. 

Once it reaches a massive sell wall or what they think is the peak, they begin shorting on the way down, opening new, extremely favorable positions. The gains from these new positions offset their losses from the unfavorable ones...by a lot. 

Institutional traders are not stupid, they see this is happening and also capitalize on it adding to the buying pressure at the beginning of a squeeze. They ride it up and they are part of the massive sell walls. As I mentioned before they are more than happy with their 100% gains in a day and have no intent on diamond handing this into the Earth. 

So institutions ride it up, sell at the top, where shorts begin opening new positions on the way back down. They then short just enough positions at the bottom so that this could be triggered yet again. Rinse and repeat.

I think the idea of the [Interstellar Yo-Yo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le6v6v/the_interstellar_yoyo/) was very close to being accurate except it was missing one key component, ""Snidely"" in the story is *intentionally* doing this. 

A circumstance like GME will never happen again, when this is all over there will be new regulations in place that don't allow these kinds of things to happen. Institutions and HF's would be out of their mind to not profit on this for as long as they can.

So my thesis is suggesting that there will not be one massive short squeeze but instead a series of squeezes before this thing finally runs out of gas or is regulated into the ground. 

**Let's think about that for a moment.**

If your original PT on GME was $1000, you are already almost there.

The first squeeze took the price from \~$12 to \~$500, \~$488 increase.

The second squeeze took the price from \~$40 to $200, \~$160 increase.

So, already GME has increased around $648. You are now only a $352 increase away from your $1000 PT.

**Is a massive short squeeze still possible?**

**Yes.** However, so much of the DD floating around is all talking about *possibility* but we as investors don't care about that. We care about *probability.* 

So what is the probability of a massive short squeeze? Well, there would need to be a significant catalyst like we had on the first go around such as Cohen joining the board. I think there are still several catalysts which I outline in [GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgkm5t/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_3/). There could very well be new catalysts that I have not mentioned since that post, such as Cohen getting appointed CEO as I have learned many believe based on his Tweet. 

Let's talk numbers.

There are two very important numbers that need to be broken for a massive squeeze to be possible. 

$170 - This is the upper limit of the downward channel and if this is broken not only does it indicate a trend reversal and potential massive bounce, but there is little to no resistance to take us to the next important number.

$200 - This is a MASSIVE sell wall. Why? Well, I think this is where a significant amount of shorts are positioned. Probably not right at $200, they probably shorted \~$205 but absolutely do not want anyone to break through that wall.

If this sell wall falls, it could prove to be an incredibly massive squeeze *however* it would need to rise a decent amount beyond the $200 wall and maintain that price point to force shorts under for a long enough time period. 

If this happens, it will begin a domino effect of the well positioned shorts chasing them all the way up to the shorts who entered over $400. At this point, FOMO + shorts covering could certainly drive the price well over $1000.

**But what is the** ***probability*** **that this will happen?**

Without a catalyst or an enormous amount of volume.

Let's consider the first squeeze and volume for reference.

**Jan 22nd:** This was the highest volume at **197,157,900,** the high was 76.76 and the low was 42.32

Absolutely insane volume, but it didn't move the price all that much (I mean at least in comparison to other days)

**Jan 25th:** Volume **177,874,000 H:**159.18 **L:** 61.13

**Jan 26th:** Volume **178,588,000 H:**150.00 **L:** 80.20

**Jan 27th:** Volume **93,396,700 H:** 380.00 **L:** 249.00

**Jan 28th:** Volume **58,815,800 H:** 483.00 **L:** 112.25

**Jan 29th:** Volume **50,259,200 H:** 413.98 **L:** 250.00  


See the pattern?

**25th:** 177M volume to nearly triple the price (160%)

**26th:** Even more volume to only double the price (87%)

**27th:**  Half the volume for a 52% increase 

The volume decrease is directly proportionate the the price increasing/decreasing, with the exception of beyond the 28th as trading was restricted. These first two days were crucial to triggering the squeeze. 

The 28th and beyond trading was restricted, but if everyone could only sell or hold, why wouldn't the price immediately fall? How could there still be support? This was shorts covering. Between just those two days there was \~109,000,000 shares exchanged where nearly everyone could only sell. A *perfect* time for shorts to cover. 

**But I thought when shorts cover the price is suppose to go up?** 

Absolutely...if trading wasn't restricted. Because virtually everyone could only sell, this means that almost all of the shares that were exchanged during these days was purchased by shorts and sold by panic sellers escaping the trading restriction FUD. 

So, as strange as it seems, I think the price going up was *some* shorts covering but for the most part, I think they covered while the price was falling. I know this *seems* counter-intuitive, but regardless of the amount of shares that needed to be covered, the amount of selling was able to drive the price down *while* they covered. Again, think about how there possibly could have been any sort of support while trading was restricted, *someone* was buying massive amounts of shares as the price fell...and it wasn't us.

**So, Hooman, if you think they covered already then why do you think a squeeze is still possible?**

Because of my thesis, entirely new shorts opened entirely new positions. Perhaps some of the old HF's also did to try to recoup some losses. Last week we *almost* forced this to happen all over again, but a TON of new shorts opened positions and the sell wall at $200 prevented us from tipping that very important, very first domino. This isn't the same landscape we were in where shorts were poorly positioned at very low numbers and we were able to catch them with their pants down, this is a different situation entirely. 

That situation is *still* squeezable. The question is...how?

Volume. Volume. Volume.   
Sheer and pure buying power.

We would *need* those first two very important days to happen again and push us past that $200 sell wall AND hold us there in order to force the well positioned shorts to close. We were so damn close but couldn't quite break it. This is precisely why my predictions for Friday were so accurate.

A catalyst, a whale, large global sentiment again, FOMO; there are A LOT of different ways this is *possible,* but as I mentioned before; we as investors deal with *probable.*

In one of my original posts, long before this became a meme stonk, I literally used the word **imminent**  in the title, that's how sure I was that the data and catalysts were aligned to create this perfect storm. If you now notice, all of my titles are **What Comes Next?** That is because this is the honest truth: literally no one knows. Why? Because third part intervention is now required for this to be possible and global sentiment and FOMO has worn off, more than that a lot of people have been burned and all the people who are still willing to play this stock are already bagholding and no longer have the capital to help with momentum. 

This has gone from a sure thing, **to a straight up gamble.** 

If I had to give it a probability, which I really don't want to do I would have to say 50/50. There is nothing significant pointing to anything that could get us past $200, but it is still *possible* with catalysts and other factors. 

What appears more likely is that this will be a series of squeezes up until it is regulated to death, people get bored, or a catalyst pops the MOASS's.

But you *can* be certain of one thing: **this will end.**

It does NOT have to end with a MOASS, but it might. My guess is that if there is no significant catalyst that ignites the MOASS by April, then this will be on pause. The interesting thing is that the *possibility* of a MOASS might never go away, but as time passes the *probability* lessens. 

The reason for my April guess is that is the end of all of my upcoming catalysts that could act as triggers. It is very possible that this thing cools down after that, shorts enter unfavorable positions, and then Cohen makes huge changes that starts this thing all over again a few months later.

That being said, I think the most *probable* outcome is a series of squeezes that quite frankly, we are just along the ride for. There is no where near enough retail buying power anymore to force anything to happen, we are at the whim of institutions and big players who are deciding what comes next. How are they getting away with this? **You.** So long as the world things that Redditor's are the reason this is happening, they can continue playing.

# I've Been Asked By Many of You to Examine the DD posted by u/HeyItsPixeL 

[The DD can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ltua0n/endgame_dd_how_last_weeks_actions_all_come/)

*Disclaimer: Both myself and this author are completely guessing as is everyone else. You should be reading everyones take and drawing your own conclusions.*

**Overall Impression:** Well done DD. There was a lot of work and effort put into this and the assumptions were data driven. I will say, there is a hint of biased mentality here using the data to fit the author's narrative. From a more objective point of view, this simply could have been shorts shorting. From a less objective point of view, it could fit support my thesis of shorts wanting these microsqueezes. Let't go as chronologically as possible.

""On February 23rd GME opened at $44.97. Within the first few seconds GME reached its Day High of $46,23. GME also reached its Day Low at 9:50AM. So within 20 minutes after the market opened, GME reached its high and its low for the whole day!""

""**Conclusion:** Someone got the price down by 10 % within a couple of minutes but the same someone got it instantly back up after that, making it seem, that their solely goal was to get GME on the SSR for the next day while trying to avoid a panic sell off by dropping the price too low. And that is really important now!""

**My take:** I actually find this quite compelling. Either this was an institution attempting to bait out shorts while preventing a panic sell, or it fits my theory that this was actually a short who wanted a short squeeze. Both ideas are equally nuts, but we live in crazy times.

""**TL;DR:** Hedgies vs. unknown Institutions (UI). UI set everything up for a gamma squeeze and need the price to close above $50. HF know and don't want that to happen and keep shorting the shit out of GME to keep it below $50. Both sides waiting for the other one to do something. Battle will start shortly before the market closes. Just a theory, no advice, ape hoping for banana 🍌💎🤲""

**My Take:** I agree. Large institutions are in this and want a squeeze as much as we do. Either that or a whale buyer like Chamath. I also agree with the $50 assumption, as that was a clear battle ground. Where we disagree is I think that last week was in fact, the gamma squeeze. However, we did not have enough volume to continue off of the gamma squeeze and tip the next, more important domino at $200+.

""On February 25th, there was a short volume of AT LEAST 33,000,000 to 51,000,000 Shares (highest report). ""

**My Take:** Well, first of all I really wish there was a link to this data. But let's go with Fintel's data that shows 33 million short volume on 02/25. If you look at the chart for 02/25 there are two very clear moments where this volume occurred. My guess would be these shorts are positioned between 140-180. This is one of the reasons I have been saying that the **135** resistance is a key point. If this domino can be tipped it will drive us up to the **170 and 200** point, but will we have the volume to break through those gates when we get there? I'm not sure. I mean, I hope so! But I'm not sure.

**Anything about naked shorting or what the actual short interest is or where the shorts are actually hiding, I'm not even going to touch.** Why? Because it doesn't matter.

This goes back to my original point, everyone is running around trying to answer the wrong question and prove that the squeeze has not been squozen. But who cares? I think 5 minutes of research can show you there is still an immense amount of short interest in this stock. What we need to be asking is WILL the squeeze be squozen and if so HOW?

**March 19th:** Including the options chain, XRT data, FTD's, etc. I think this date could in fact act as a catalyst. But that's about it. To me I would just add this to my list of potential catalysts and not think much of it. There is a lot of good information backing this theory, but there is a whole lot more theory backing this theory. In my opinion, this date should just be added to list of potential catalysts that could either A: spark the MOASS or B: It could be the date of another microsqueeze.

**""MY Conclusion**: The squeeze is inevitable.""

**My take:** Absolutely not inevitable. Certainly possible.

# Monday Predictions

Again, this is not including any unforeseen catalysts that could kick this thing off. I can't express that enough. That is why holding is gamble that could really go either way. If something happens whether we see it or not it could send this thing skyrocketing. My predictions for Monday are based on no new catalysts.

Virtually, I am expecting a repeat of Friday that could end differently.

**Open:** I am expecting a sharp price increase at open, volume again will a key indicator as to which direction this is going to go. 

I imagine we will struggle at **115** resistance but we can hopefully blow through that, the real test will come at **135** resistance.

 If we reach **135** and blow through it, then this gets very interesting. I see the next resistance points at **150, 155, and then the really important ones of 170 and 200.** I already explained that if we surpass these limits we are setting up nicely for a MOASS.

If we reach **135** but volume is too low (if you're not sure how to gauge the volume keep an eye on how many times we retest it). If it takes more than two attempts, without a significant volume boost I can't imagine us being able to handle the more difficult resistance points.

**Shortly after Open:** My guess right now is still before 10:00 (but it could go later in the day if I'm wrong about people covering on Friday) if we have not broken through those early resistance points, I think the slow bleed will begin. 

My bottom PT is somewhere between 60-80.

Once we hit this mark, it gets difficult to predict. No one understands at all how the market fairly values this stock. The closest I would say would be 40-50 since thats where the greatest support we had was. It is entirely possible we see a bounce from the 60-80 price if shorts use this opportunity to cover, the market see's it as a good point to enter and ride the wave, or if GME is now simply valued at this price due to the management changes that helped kickstart this second wave to begin with.

After that, it's a blur. This truly is a day to day stock to analyze and sadly I cannot provide this kind of DD every single day. I don't have work Monday so I'm considering live streaming this.

# So What's Your Play Hooman?

Now, some of you will call me a shill\_or\_whatever but I simply have a different tactic. You might believe in the MOASS, but I'm not certain I think it's *probable.* So I will be playing these mircosqueezes instead. 

I mentioned in my last post, I have a really nasty wash sale. From what I understand, this is simply for tax purposes but my cost basis is still being increased by $100. IE if I purchase the stock for $80 my cost basis will be adjusted to $180. I'm still unclear on how this works, if someone could clarify in the comments section I would absolutely love to continue playing this stock. I will be spending the rest of today attempting to find this answer on my own time as well, so if I'm not responsive to the comments like I usually am, please understand I am attempting to prepare for this week.

So...as long as the wash sale isn't an actual reflection of my real price, then I will buy as soon as the market opens. I will wait until we see how we handle resistance and if it looks like we have a shot at winning, **I will buy more there to fight the good fight**. If it looks like there is nowhere near enough volume and my purchase won't make a difference, then that will be my indicator to sell. 

**This part is vital:** If you are SELLING at the resistance points, you are hurting the cause. BUYING at these points is what will break through the wall. But if we make multiple attempts and cannot break through and it starts falling, then you might as well profit. You holding won't change the fact that we couldn't break resistance. **I can't stress this enough**. If you simply sell when we hit resistance, you will be part of the reason the squeeze doesn't happen. So either holding or buying will help push the price up at these targets, but if it is lost no matter what you do, then sell and prepare for another attempt.

Once it gets below 90 I will start scooping up shares again, averaging down with the price (I do this instead of going all in trying to predict the bottom).

From there I will wait to see if that second bounce does in fact happen again. If it does, I will sell at whatever I think the top is and then will re-enter just before close. Again, if there is enough volume and it appears there is a chance to break through then I will not sell, I will buy to try to push through that resistance.

Why would I re-enter just before close? Three reasons:

1. I'm better positioned and back on board in case the MOASS does trigger
2. I won't have to buy at open if we see the same exact pattern on Tuesday.
3. I am bullish on GME thanks to Cohen and would like to re-open my long position.

If the same pattern continues Tuesday, I will repeat this play until the pattern stops and I am sitting on A LOT more shares at a MUCH BETTER cost basis.

**TL;DR:** The squeeze has not been squoze, but it has become closer to 50/50 odds that it will occur. I think its more probable that a series of microsqueezes occur and I will play accordingly. Simply holding does not increase a price, buying does. My play will not only net me profits, but it will increase my buying power significantly. There is no TLDR to justify this post, if you don't feel like reading then you aren't playing with enough money to be concerned and none of this applies to you anyways. Just remember, this will all come to an end at some point and that end is not guaranteed with a squeeze. Happy trading!

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, none of this is advice at all. It is my analysis of the situation that I have been following and my interpretation of the data at hand. The only direct advice I have for anyone is you should do what's best for you. I am bullish on GME long term which makes this a lot less risky for me because if I end up with bags (as long as they aren't too heavy) that's perfectly fine with me. Anyone who tries to convince you I am a shill or bot is almost certainly an uneducated investor, I am not even a bear on this situation, but you should always examine the bear case, not blatantly ignore it in search of confirmation bias.*",7461,1186,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/luo6u5/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_6/,all,Company Discussion,0.85

Who is their customer and what is their product?

RH would say the customer is you, the retail investor... but don’t customers give money for services?  Oh, right, they make money from order flow... that means their real customer is Citadel.

What does that make retail investors?  The product.  Just like FB and others, you are essentially the product that is being pawned around, except in this case, you have your own dollars at stake.

Is this necessarily bad?  Depends.  But if you are not their customer, you are likely not getting the attention you deserve as an investor.  The sleek look and ease to use is just to make the product more lucrative for their actual clients.

Also, it’s a tech company, not a financial services company.  Not inherently a bad thing, but a company who’s core competency is software development, and not equities trading, I’d think twice.

IRA?  Sorry.  I haven’t looked into why specifically, but it likely doesn’t generate the same money as a brokerage account.  If you were actually RH’s customer, why wouldn’t they offer you one of the best and most trusted retirement vehicles in this country?

Customer Service - never used it, but again, it’s a tech company... when have you ever got on the phone with google?

Leadership - the congressional hearings were pathetic... what is core to leadership?  Seeking responsibility for your actions.  This ceo needs to hire someone else to be the point man, he isn’t ready for the big leagues.

lhd8gm,2021-02-10,2021-02-10 23:51:47,A tip that I heard right when I started trading that has helped keep me sane and grow as an investor,"I've only been trading with real money for about a month, but I read something a few months ago, while doing my research, that really stuck and I wanted to share.

As investors, we often look at the moves we've made and judge ourselves on what we missed on or what we hit on. This is part of growing and learning as an investor.

But the thing that many people forget is the **almost** trades. Those trades that we got close to pulling the trigger on, but didn't. Whatever that reason was, we all have moves that we almost made but *something* made us pass on it. 

#Write them down.#

Record every trade that you almost made, or considered making. Record the date, the current value, and the reason you didn't make the trade.

This has been very valuable to me in my first few weeks of trading. We all look through our portfolio and our trade history and think, ""man - if only I held this longer"" or ""I really messed up buying this on the rise"". But what we often forget is to give ourselves credit the the decisions we made that there isn't a history of on our chosen broker. For every single regret we have as traders, there is a dodged bullet that our gut, training, or education helped us avoid. On the flip side, there are also those securities we saw a post about, or noticed while browsing that sparked something in us but we hesitated on. Those ones that have been nothing but green since then and we are regretting.

If you don't record the moves you **almost** made, then you're missing out on valuable person growth information that can help you become a better trader. Write down every move you almost made in a notebook and look back every once in a while. The more you write at the time the better.

Hope this can help others as much as it's helped me. Good luck y'all!

Edit: it seems there are a few of you that take it personally and feel the need to insult because I've only been trading with real money for a month. I've also been researching, learning, and trading with virtual accounts for years. I'm by no means a seasoned vet or an expert - and that's why I'm giving out a tip that has nothing to do with certain securities or evaluation of them.

Membership fee to remain flat.","A top Costco Wholesale executive confirmed the big-box retailer has **no plans to change the price of its $1.50 hot dog-and-soda combo at its stores despite months of decades-high inflation.**

**Costco CFO Richard Galanti reiterated the cheap price point on the fan-favorite deal would stay in place during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday.**

An analyst asked whether Costco was adjusting prices in other parts of its business to maintain sales margins for its hot dog-and-soda deal and other value offerings.

“Lightning just struck me,” Galanti joked when the combo was mentioned. He added that higher-margin businesses such as gas and travel sales help Costco maintain its value deals.

“Those things help us be more aggressive in other areas, or as you mentioned, hold the price on the hot dog and the soda a little longer – forever,” Galanti added.

Costco and other retailers have hiked prices over the last year, passing along the higher costs of commodities and goods to consumers. Inflation has slightly declined in recent months but was still hovering at a hotter-than-expected 8.3% in August.

 Galanti estimated that price inflation at Costco was about 8% during the fourth quarter, with increases “a little higher on the food and sundries side.”

**Costco doesn’t have any immediate plans to hike its membership fees**, according to the executive. Annual membership dues at the retailer currently start at $60.

 Still, Galanti noted that **membership price increases were likely at some point in the future. Costco has generally hiked its fees roughly every five to six years**.

**“Our view is, is we are confident in our ability to do so and at some point, we will. But it’s a question of when, not if,”** Galanti said.

Despite the inflationary environment, Costco topped analysts’ expectations in the fourth quarter. The retailer posted quarterly revenue $72.09 billion and earnings per share.

&#x200B;

*KEY POINTS*

* *Shares in Trump Media Technology Group fell sharply after the company reported a net loss of $58 million in 2023.*
* *The newly publicly traded social media company of former President Donald Trump had total revenue of just $4.1 million last year, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.*
* *A year earlier, Trump Media & Technology Group reported a net profit of $50.5 million and total revenue of only $1.47 million, according to the 8-K filing.*
* *“TMTG expects to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future,” says the filing by the company, which has a market valuation of more than $6.5 billion.*
* *Trump Media, which trades under the ticker DJT on the Nasdaq, owns the Truth Social app.*

&#x200B;

*The share price of Trump Media fell sharply Monday morning after the social media app company closely tied to former president Donald Trump reported a net loss of $58.2 million on revenue of just $4.1 million in 2023.*

*Trump Media & Technology Group shares were trading down by more than 18.8% as of 12:38 a.m. ET.*

*Despite that plunge, the company’s market capitalization was still more than $6.8 billion after its 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed the loss for last year.*

*Much of the net loss appears to come from $39.4 million in interest expense, according to the filing.*

*A spokesperson for the company did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the new filing.*

*The filing shows that in 2022, Trump Media had a net profit of $50.5 million and total revenue of only $1.47 million.*

*The company ended 2023 with just $2.7 million in cash on hand, the filing said.*

*The losses last year by Trump Media — the owner of the Truth Social app routinely used by the former president — could continue for some time, according to the company.*

*“TMTG expects to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future,” says the filing, which came a week after the company began trading under the ticker DJT on the Nasdaq.*

*The filing also warns shareholders that Trump’s involvement in the company could put it at greater risk than other social media companies.*

*TMTG also disclosed to regulators that the company had identified “material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting” when it prepared a previous financial statement for the first three quarters of 2023.*

*As of Monday, Trump Media said these “identified material weaknesses continue to exist.”*

&#x200B;

*Trump owns 57.3% of Trump Media shares, a stake valued at more than $4 billion, which Forbes last week said would represent well more than half of his total net worth.*

*He also stands to receive another 36 million shares of so-called “earn-out” shares over the next three years, as long as Trump Media’s stock during that time hits a series of price benchmarks. These targets are all well below the company’s stock price early Monday.*

*Trump Media’s share price rocketed when its stock began trading Tuesday, several days after the firm merged with a special purpose acquisition company. The newly merged company now trades under Trump’s initials, DJT.*

*Analysts note that the company’s high valuation is partly due to stock purchases by Trump’s political supporters, who are enthusiastic about owning part of a company so closely associated with the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.*

*That enthusiasm creates unique risks for the company, however. The new 8-K filing says that Trump Media “may be subject to greater risks than typical social media platforms because of the focus of its offerings and the involvement of President Trump.”*

*“These risks include active discouragement of users, harassment of advertisers or content providers, increased risk of hacking of TMTG’s platform, lesser need for Truth Social if First Amendment speech is not suppressed, criticism of Truth Social for its moderation practices, and increased stockholder suits.”*",7038,833,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bt87cz/trump_media_shares_fall_sharply_after_company/,all,Company News,0.91

Instead of thinking about how I've only made 10% in 8 months in one of the strongest bull runs, I like to think that I've gone from $850 to $1100 (30% gain) while the SPY has gone up 8% in the past two months.  I hope these type of gains can continue, but time will tell. Even if I can't continue these gains, I've really enjoyed the learning process and think that the knowledge I've gained is beneficial and worth the time to me.

1krvdgw,2025-05-21,2025-05-21 07:23:34,Target takes an earnings beating,"Target has had bad news after bad news. In the most completely politically agnostic way, their DEI stance really hurt the brand and store traffic. They had previously faced issues from store thefts, bloated inventories and declining sales as shoppers switched to more cost friendly retailers. And this was all before tariffs took center stage. 


Now Target has cut their 2025 forecast as revenue decreases and in store shopping drops. Adjusted earnings also came in notably lower. Target CEO avoided saying whether prices would increase because of tariff pressures, but the headwinds continue to mount. 


A few brighter spots are growing digital sales and increased same day delivery. Both full year revenue and earnings have been adjusted down and Target has created a new initiative to address the challenges. But overall the macro environment and company specific challenges have beaten down Target badly.

- DCA all the way down and then continue DCAing on the eventual return up

I used to check my stock app every minute and sold because I got nervous and uncomfortable. I would see gains that have made insane money disappear and sell off trying to hopefully get back at a lower price. From personal experience, I would encourage many of you to take one hard look at your stock portfolio right now and ask yourself if this is a company you see being able to exist in the long-term future. If the answer is no, you should cut some of your position or get rid of it. If the answer is yes, sit back, maybe liquidate a few shares, but don't get uneasy about it. It's the stock market - you win some, you lose some. If the company you own isn't going through a fundamental change such as a huge decrease in revenue or an SEC investigation, stop being upset.

If I never sold a single share of any company from the day I started investing, I would likely be a millionaire right now with an initial investment of $30,000. Don't make the same mistake I did. Buy companies you trust and can reasonably see being a sustainable business and just ride it. More often than not, you're going to end up green. From what I see now, there are going to be a ton of opportunities to get in on some stocks soon.

1j437g9,2025-03-05,2025-03-05 08:35:50,Trump Calls for End to $52 Billion Chips Act Subsidy Program,">President Donald Trump called for ending a bipartisan $52 billion semiconductor subsidy program that’s spurred more than $400 billion in investments from companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp.

>“Your Chips Act is a horrible, horrible thing,” the president said in a prime-time address to Congress on Tuesday. Trump implored US House Speaker Mike Johnson to get rid of the legislation and use “whatever is left over” to “reduce debt or any other reason.”

>His remarks were met with applause in a chamber that passed the Chips and Science Act less than three years ago. Vice President JD Vance, whose home state of Ohio won a massive Intel project thanks to the law, stood up to show his support for its revocation.

>The Chips Act is among the most significant US forays into industrial policy in more than a generation. It set aside $39 billion in grants — plus loans and 25% tax breaks — to revitalize American semiconductor manufacturing, as well as $11 billion for chip research and development. The aim was to reduce reliance on Asia for electronic components that power everything from smartphones to massive data centers.

>Trump, however, has consistently derided a program he regards as a waste of government funds, arguing tariffs would achieve the same outcome while filling coffers. Republicans have also indicated that they want to repeal what they see as “social” provisions of the Chips Act. That could involve eliminating labor-friendly regulations or environmental requirements.

>Officials on both sides of the aisle have touted the Chips Act as crucial to US national and economic security, and Trump could have a hard time getting congressional support to repeal it. Dozens of GOP lawmakers voted for the measure, and many red districts have won factories or other projects supported by the law.

>That includes South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., which have committed to multibillion-dollar projects in Texas and Indiana that were contingent on funding and support from the US government. Company representatives declined to comment on the president’s remarks.

>Trump, favoring tariffs over incentives, has signaled that import levies on chips could come as soon as next month. Companies can avoid those duties, he has said, by building factories on American soil. He has not offered additional details.

>On Monday, Trump credited the tariff threats for TSMC’s decision to invest $100 billion in the US, on top of a previous $65 billion commitment. He touted that project in his address Tuesday, referencing the full $165 billion figure. “We’re giving them no money,” Trump said. “All that was important to them was they didn’t want to pay the tariffs.”

>A TSMC spokesperson declined to comment.

>The company originally announced plans for a $12 billion US site during Trump’s first term and expanded that project to three factories under Biden. To support those facilities, TSMC struck an agreement with Biden officials for $6.6 billion in Chips Act grants and $5 billion in loans.

>As is the case for other Chips Act awards, the funding is supposed to be disbursed over time, as TSMC hits negotiated project milestones. The company received $1.5 billion before Biden left office.

>Trump did not specify whether he would attempt to claw back money that’s already been disbursed, renege on remaining incentives to which the government has already committed, or simply not provide additional support for the chipmaker’s latest investment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Monday that the newly announced projects — three additional chip plants, plus R&D and advanced packaging sites — won’t win federal funds.

>“The main uncertainty is the future of TSMC,” said Xin-Yao Ng, an investment director at abrdn plc. “One long-time competitive advantage was their clustering in Taiwan, where labor costs are still reasonable, construction costs are cheaper, government is supportive, and they can find more workers with vocational training. It’s completely different in the US if they are to shift more manufacturing. Subsidies from US were to be crucial to help mitigate some of the higher costs and challenges.”

>TSMC is among 20 companies that reached binding Chips Act agreements with Biden officials. The deals, which represent more than 85% of the manufacturing incentives available under the program, are designed to support leading-edge facilities by companies like TSMC, Intel, Samsung and Micron Technology Inc. — as well as older-generation factories by the likes of GlobalFoundries Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.

>Companies have generally viewed those agreements as ironclad — regardless of who’s in office. But some of them have worried that the Trump administration could seek to modify the terms, Bloomberg has reported. Lutnick has said he cannot commit to honoring existing contracts without reviewing them first.

>That review is ongoing, and Lutnick’s intentions for the initiative remain unclear. So far, his questions to program staff have focused on the rationale behind award decisions and the government’s legal authority to claw money back, Bloomberg has reported. The current Chips Act team, meanwhile, has been preparing a list of potential adjustments to the funding application process and final contracts that would be minimally disruptive.

>A spokesperson for GlobalWafers Co., which won $406 million from the Chips Act for factories in Texas and Missouri, said the Taiwanese company is committed to its expansion strategy and views any changes to the Chips Act as “unlikely.”

>But if the law were to be modified in some way, the spokesperson said, “we would reassess future investments, including evaluating US market demand, pricing, and potential tariffs if production were moved outside the US.”

**My take:** Brutally bad for semiconductor sector if CHIPS is actually repealed, INTC is especially targeted. There'd be less semiconductor manufacturing in the US (INTC/TSM/Samsung) primarily because we subsidize and have tax incentives for current US chip manfacturing projects, and companies that haven't received their funding will likely scale back projects [(remember INTC delayed their Ohio plant to 2028?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0cq51/intel_delays_28_billion_ohio_chip_factory_in_new/). The US would also be far more dependent on semiconductor production overseas. 

This also has spillover into the quantum computing stocks (IONQ/RGTI) and AI sector due to the sectors being so reliant on technological development and supply from the semis sectors.

Overall don't think new tariffs are going to be an adequate replacement for what the US has committed so far (but we don't know much about  the tariffs yet), and the markets hate uncertainty.

v9wqou,2022-06-11,2022-06-11 08:39:17,Gasoline prices top $5 a gallon nationally for the first time and are likely headed higher,"The average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline rose above $5 nationally for the first time due to increased demand from the economy reopening from the pandemic and depleted oil supplies stemming in part from the war in Ukraine.

Prices look set to continue rising into the summer months, analysts said.

the average national price reached $5.004 on Saturday. That’s up from about $3.07 a year ago and a record price not adjusted for inflation. At the end of the week, prices had already averaged $5 or more in about 20 states, with the highest prices on the West Coast.

“By my calculations, the typical household is spending about $160 more on gas a month than a year ago,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “That’s a big bite.”

Gasoline prices normally peak in mid-May, but this year they have continued to rise and the average price is about 65 cents higher than a month ago. Due to short supplies this year, analysts are forecasting that prices may not top out until mid-July, when summer driving season traditionally peaks.

“I don’t think we’re far away” from the highest prices, said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. “I don’t think it would eclipse $5.50. I would say $5.25 is the top, but again, the market is unhinged.”

However, if there are any serious refinery outages this summer, or disruptions from hurricanes, gasoline prices could spike, he added.

Gasoline is in shorter supply than normal because the U.S. has lost about 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity, since before the pandemic. At the same time, sanctions on Russian energy has sent oil prices sharply higher and created tight supplies of both oil and fuel globally.

Analysts say while consumers are feeling pain at the pump, the price of fueling a car with gasoline is not as big a part of a household’s spending as it had been in the past. That is in part due to more efficient vehicles.

According to a CNBC analysis, drivers were spending an estimated average 20 cents per mile on gasoline as of June this year, even with the steep price increases. In 1980, that same mile would have cost 30 cents in today’s dollars.",6817,2146,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/v9wqou/gasoline_prices_top_5_a_gallon_nationally_for_the/,all,Unknown,0.92
t8t9ep,2022-03-07,2022-03-07 11:37:46,Biden administration is moving ahead with a ban on Russian oil imports,"WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is willing to move ahead with a ban on Russian oil imports into the United States without the participation of allies in Europe, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

President Joe Biden is expected to hold a video conference call with the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom on Monday as his administration continues to seek their support for a ban on the imports.

The White House is also negotiating with congressional leaders who are working on fast-tracking legislation banning Russian imports, a move that is forcing the administration to work on an expedited timeline, a source told Reuters

**A senior U.S. official told Reuters that no final decision has been made but ""it is likely just the U.S if it happens”**

Oil prices have soared to their highest levels since 2008 due to delays in the potential return of Iranian crude to global markets and as the United States and European allies consider banning Russian imports.

Europe relies on Russia for crude oil and natural gas but has become more open to the idea of banning Russian products. read more The United States relies far less on Russian crude and products, but a ban would help drive prices up and pinch U.S. consumers already seeing historic prices at the gas pump. read more

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a Sunday letter that her chamber is ""exploring"" legislation to ban the import of Russian oil and that Congress intends to enact this week $10 billion in aid for Ukraine in response to Moscow's military invasion of its neighbor.

A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced a bill on Thursday to ban U.S. imports of Russian oil. The bill is getting fast-tracked.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, the White House slapped sanctions on exports of technologies to Russia's refineries and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has never launched.

So far, it has stopped short of targeting Russia's oil and gas exports as the Biden administration weighs the impacts on global oil markets and U.S. energy prices.

Asked if the United States has ruled out banning Russian oil imports unilaterally, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Sunday said: ""I'm not going to rule out taking action one way or another, irrespective of what they do, but everything we've done, the approach starts with coordinating with allies and partners,"" Blinken said.

At the same time, the White House did not deny that Biden might make a trip to Saudi Arabia as the United States seeks to get Riyadh to increase energy production. Axios reported that such a trip was a possibility.

""This is premature speculation and no trip is planned,"" a White House official said.

A year ago Biden shifted U.S. policy away from a focus on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is considered by many to be the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia and next in line to the throne held by the 85-year-old King Salman.

s62x5o,2022-01-17,2022-01-17 07:28:53,Why I fail to see how the Metaverse will succeed,"I've read that a lot of people here are super bullish on the Metaverse and various ""digital words""

As a VR consumer and developer I however am very skeptical that the masses will flock to an digital world.

The metaverse is not a new concept, its been around since the 90s if not further back. There is already a form of metaverse called ""Second life"" where you can own properties, join communities and pretty much ""live"" in a real world.

&#x200B;

Now I know a lot of people will say that we simply don't know the possibilities yet and we are thinking too simple minded but let's be creative. What could be some use cases that people would prefer doing digital vs real life?

Metaverse cinema? Yeah that already exists in current VR games and it's really not that fun and you obviously can't recreate the pixel density nor the actual sound acoustic that a lot of people don't get from their home system.

&#x200B;

Meetings? Yeah I guess if you prefer to strap a VR headset on you and be forced to see your digital coworkers instead of having a 2D Teams screen where you can actually do something else than stare at your coworkers during the meeting.

&#x200B;

Dating? I almost don't want to go into this. Are you telling me a digital date would surpass the actual real life vision of a human, the smells, the toucing hand? 

&#x200B;

Virtual jog by the beach? I literally saw this example on the sub. You think people would really want to jog in a virtual beach oppose to actually going outside?

&#x200B;

Whatever the metaverse is it will be a subpar experience to the real thing. Unless we can advance graphic rendering by a hella of a lot or actually tapping into our senses I fail to see how the metaverse would ""awe"" anyone. 

&#x200B;

If we do go fully Inception, ""simulation"" reality then we got bigger issues than the Metaverse.

1j9zdif,2025-03-12,2025-03-12 20:28:31,"Trump: New travel barriers for Canadian tourists, the biggest source of US tourism. Expect impact on airlines, hotels, retail, restaurants","Today the Trump administration announced new visitation barriers for Canadian tourists. Any tourists staying longer than 30 days must register and provide fingerprints to authorities. How many Canadians actually vacation longer for 30 days+ in the US you may ask?

* **1 million snowbirds (Canadian tourists** travelling to the US to avoid Canadian winters) reportedly **contributed $6.5b** to Florida's economy **during just a 6 month period** (typical duration of their stays)
* **Canadians were the largest visitors to the US** comprising of **\~30% of all US tourist visits** in 2023.
* Those tourists with billions in combined disposable income just had it harder to come to the US to spend their money
* While this policy in isolation may not have a material impact, combined with instigating a trade war and threats of annexation seemed to have turned off many Canadians (rightfully so) on spending a single penny in the US.
* Since Canada was the only country previously exempted from this rule, reversing this is policy is leaving many Canadians feeling further alienated by the US, especially given their economic contributions to local US economies

I'm bearish for Q2, Q3, and potentially Q4 for the following industries

* **REITs**: NNN REIT, Drop in tourism will bankrupt many small US businesses with thin margins in the restaurant industry. While you can't make investment moves on small businesses, this will lead to defaulting on their leases and commercial REITs that focus on restaurants will have high vacancy rates.
* **Travel Bookers**: Expedia? Not sure how much of their revenue concentration is based on US bookings vs. global
* **Hotels:** Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Air Bnb, Caesars Entertainment
* **Airlines:** American, Delta, United, Air Canada,
* **QSRs:** Darden Restaurants, Texas Roadhouse, Brinker International (food chains primarily with US locations attract tourists due to the novelty factor of not being able to go in Canada)
* **Amusement Parks**: Disney, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, United Parks & Resorts
* **Car Rentals:** Enterprise, Hertz, Avis
* **Retail**: TJX Companies, Ross, Macys, Kohls, Target (retail stores with no presence in Canada are often attract tourists who are interested in shopping at retail stores they can't back in Canada)
* **Energy**: Shell, Chevron, Exxon (lots of Canadian tourists do road trips and gas up in the US, but since these companies also operate in Canada and Canadians are just going to replace their US road triups with Canadian ones, I do not believe they will be impacted

Other factors to consider before making moves

* Can US consumer spending or tourists from other countries fill the economic void Canadian tourists will leave in the tune of billions of dollars?
* Will other countries follow suite, either as a response to the US administrations polices, or in a sign of solidary with Canadians?
* Even if positive relations are restored between US-Canada by the end of the year, will that change souring Canadian consumer sentiment to US businesses and travel?

Edit: In no way is this post a dig at Canadians for deciding to stop visiting. I am also Canadian. This post is a purely from a finance/stock perspective on which industries will get negatively impacted by this administrations policies the most so that people here can adjust their portfolio allocations accordingly if they have exposure into said industries. Vive la Canada!

m3c0lk,2021-03-12,2021-03-12 01:49:18,Roblox is insanely overpriced,"I know that no one likes a bear and furthermore people feel connected to this stock since their kids play the game or because it's a video game and it's fun to invest in that stuff but facts over feelings when dealing with money because it has no feelings. So first we have to base our value, the company raised 528 million$ from private sources last year at a valuation of 28 billion dollars. It later went public via direct listing at a base valuation of 32 billion with 40$ stock price only to rise to 77$ and a market cap of 40.56 billion. The problem with this is Microsoft bought Mojang (so essentially the Minecraft IP) for 2.5 billion  in late 2014 when they had 38 million in revenue which is relatively nothing compared to RBLX now but when we go back in time to just 2017 it (Rblx) had relatively only 45 million in revenue vs Minecraft's 350 million. Now let's go to last year when Minecraft had a monthly active user base of 130 million players vs Rblx's 150 million. It also had 953 million dollars in revenue but with 253 million in net losses. Now compare that to Minecraft who had a revenue of 415 million which is up significantly from  the previous years 375 million and it becomes clear that Roblox is very overvalued. Furthermore to show the point we have another Microsoft purchase, this time of Zenimax  Media inc for 7.5 billion $ for properties like TES, DOOM, Fallout, Dishonored, Starfield and many more with a wide variety of studios included like Bethesda, Zenimax, Tango, Arkane (Deathloop), Id and Machine Games . Just in that bundle Doom Eternal (1 game) had revenue of 350 million dollars and Skyrim with lifetime revue of over 620 million. The last showing of this is Sony's purchase of Insomniac in 2018 for 229 million dollars and since then have created 2 games that have raked in more than the initial investment with Spiderman 2018 and Spiderman MM having brought in approximately 250-270 million $ and with another game in the pipeline with Ratchet and Clank A rift in Time. Final note: EA's entire market cap which consists of Madden, Battlefield, Fifa ( yearly releases with micro transactions) and many other titles is at 30 billion, Take Two which owns GTA, Red Dead,  NBA 2K and many others and is valued at 20 billion, the thought that Roblox is worth almost more than both these titans combined is insane and nonsensical.

Edit: **This is my opinion not advice.** To play devils advocate since a lot of people like the stock here you go: Roblox has doubled it's earnings every year since 2017 and had record revenue of almost 950 million this past year. It's player base is also massive and almost doubling every year just like it's revenue. It also has 830 million in the bank right now and can easily grow by going to Asia and or incorporating more adult themes. Now other than the fact that it's trading 40x P/S you have to bet that the game will both keep growing and making profits at the same pace as now which I don't see but here there u go.",6358,1453,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3c0lk/roblox_is_insanely_overpriced/,all,Company Analysis,0.89

Musk, who is Tesla’s largest individual shareholder, has also enjoyed the stock propelling higher in part due to the broader market — NASDAQ topped 20,000 for the first time ever Wednesday.

o1jm8m,2021-06-16,2021-06-16 20:16:20,A note to young investors (or new investors),"As the Fed caused a bit of a ripple in the market today and I considered vacating a position (but ultimately didn't).  I thought a little bit about my journey over the years and thought I'd share a story and a few things I've learned.

Back in 2003, I made my first move in the stock market by taking an $1800 tax return and buying 200 shares of a coal company called Consol.  At the time it traded under the symbol CNX.  I bought it with almost no DD simply because it paid a pretty good dividend.  (Around .50/share if I recall correctly.)  This is back when internet trading really wasn't a thing.  I bought it through my bank and the trade cost me **$40**!  (I actually had to call a broker at my bank and place the trade over the phone.  Ancient times, right?)  lol  I figured, win lose or draw, eventually this stock will pay for itself with the dividend.  I didn't follow the market much after that because I was really holding for the dividend, but realized a couple of years later, it had climbed into the 30s.  Around 2007 it had hit 55 and I decided to sell.  Still with my bank, the trade cost me another forty bucks!  I took the money and put it in a basic savings account where it basically sat doing nothing until 2016.  (I missed the crash of 08, by being liquid at the time, but this was pure luck.  Nobody saw that coming.)

In 2016, after some reading I decided I had more confidence in trading so I took the money and opened an investor's checking/trading account with Charles Schwab.  *I was amazed at trades costing $4.99 and done on my laptop*!  lol  After quite a bit of DD I decided to buy 300 shares of NVIDIA.  At around $24 a share, it cost me about $7200.  (I took the rest and made a down payment on a new (*used*) car and an AK-47.)  lol...

After that, I just held the stock.  Diamond handed it as the kids say.  I've bought and sold quite a few other stocks over the years, but those two trades are where I started.  Two trades over the course of 17 years turned an $1800 tax return into a nice safety net worth over $200,000 with almost no effort on my part.

What have I learned?

Even a small amount of money in the stock market can lead to a big return.  But don't invest more than you can afford.  For me, a tax return one year was about all I could throw at it in my 20s.  ""YOLOing"" your rent check is never a good idea.

Be PATIENT.  You're not going to get rich overnight.  That type of thing is rare and risky.  Do your DD and hold onto what you're confident in.

When the market takes a downturn, **BUY!**  One of my biggest regrets is not investing heavily in 2008 when I was very liquid and the market had taken a nose dive.  I did not repeat this mistake last April/May when the pandemic caused another crash.  I bought everything I could.  Particularly old giants like Ford, and GE which were no brainer bargains at >$5.  The worst thing you can do is panic sell.  The market will come back.  Hold on and accumulate.  (I actually figured it might take 2 years for a comeback this time, but we bounced back much earlier.)  This thinking is what got me to hold the position I was thinking of bailing on today, when I realized I would just be panic selling in advance of some Fed news.  Regardless of the news, the market would bounce back.

Never let savings sit in a traditional savings account. (*like I did for 8 years from 2007-2016...lol)*  Even if compound interest is all you're after, there are much better rates with other financial products.

Be patient, *but don't be afraid to take profits*.  Don't fall in love.  Have an exit plan.  I sold Consol around 55 with a 9 entry.  Pretty good...  Later that same year, it climbed into the 90s.  Made me wince, but I didn't regret it.  *Unless you have a crystal ball, you're never going to enter at a historic low and exit at an all time high and that's ok.*  I realized at the time that coal was cyclical and was most likely going to decline in value in the coming years.  I stuck to the plan.  When I saw a spike, I sold.  For perspective, that high in the 90s in 08 hasn't been repeated since.  Consol trades in the high teens now and offers no dividend. (New ticker CEIX)  So in hindight I exited on a bubble that could have been better, but if I waited too long, it could have been much worse.

It's never too late to start.  If you look at those two simple trades over the span of 17 years, you could potentially do the same thing in your late 40s with a small amount of money (*remember nothing you can't afford to lose)* and have a decent nest egg by the time you hit 100% retirement in your 60s.

I hope to have given a little insight here.  I thought it was worth sharing.  If you disagree, don't be too hard on me.  I'm not a financial professional...  :D

> President Donald Trump has threatened to place a 100 percent tariff on Barbie maker Mattel, after the company's CEO said it would continue to manufacture outside the U.S. but would be reducing its reliance on Chinese imports. ""I've heard [Mattel] said: 'Well we're going to go counter, we're going to try going someplace else,' "" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""That's OK, let him go, and we'll put a 100 percent tariff on his toys, and he won't sell one toy in the United States, and that's their biggest market."" Trump's threat to Mattel comes as toys—in particular dolls—have emerged as a flashpoint in the ongoing debates over tariffs and his administration's trade policy.

> Trump and his cabinet have downplayed the issue's significance, with the president himself repeatedly stating that girls will be better off for having fewer dolls, and now threatening tariffs on one of the world's most iconic doll manufacturers.

> During the company's first-quarter earnings call, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said the tariff-driven price hike was one of the three ""mitigating actions"" the company had been forced to take in response to the tariffs, alongside a reduction in its dependence on China-sourced products and a broader diversification of its supply chain. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Kreiz was asked whether it would be cheaper to relocate some manufacturing to the U.S. due to the tariffs, but responded: ""We don't see that happening."" ""We believe that production in other countries—where we can be efficient and more productive—is the best balance between manufacturing outside of the U.S. and [continuing] to develop product in terms of design and creativity in America,"" he said. In response to the price increases, and similar announcements made by car manufacturer Ford this week, Trump said: ""I think they're saying that just to negotiate deals with me.""

sfjfds,2022-01-29,2022-01-29 09:40:30,Moderna’s HIV Vaccine Has Officially Begun Human Trials,"Few people have been hit harder during the COVID-19 pandemic than those who are immunocompromised — including people whose immune systems have been ravaged by HIV/AIDS. But that dark chapter of medical history may soon be drawing to a close. That’s the hope in Washington, D.C., at least, where scientists with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and Moderna have announced that human trials for the company’s experimental HIV vaccine have officially begun.

“We are tremendously excited to be advancing this new direction in HIV vaccine design with Moderna's mRNA platform,” said IAVI president and CEO Mark Feinberg in the announcement. “The search for an HIV vaccine has been long and challenging, and having new tools in terms of immunogens and platforms could be the key to making rapid progress toward an urgently needed, effective HIV vaccine.” Human candidates, recruited for clinical trials last August, received the study’s first shots on Thursday at George Washington University’s School of Medicine and Health Sciences. The vaccine builds on technology developed by Moderna during their COVID-19 vaccine production, with the goal of using mRNA to boost HIV immunogens and prevent the virus from disabling B cells, which are essential to fighting disease.

Although medicines like PrEP and antiretroviral therapy (ART) have proved somewhat effective in slowing the spread of HIV and reducing its mortality, the virus is still a threat to global health nearly forty years after it was first identified. Scientists hope to conclude human trials next year in 2023, coinciding with HIV’s grim 40th anniversary. “We believe advancing this HIV vaccine program in partnership with IAVI and Scripps Research is an important step in our mission to deliver on the potential for mRNA to improve human health,” said Moderna president Stephen Hoge. Only time will tell whether this vaccine will succeed where others have failed — but we’ll be praying, crossing our digits, and wishing on every star that by next year, LGBTQ+ communities around the globe will have a new reason to celebrate.

mk9aak,2021-04-04,2021-04-04 21:08:56,"Microsoft wins U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 billion over 10 years","The U.S. Army said Wednesday that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.

The deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software.

It follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions.

The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon.

""The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective,"" Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post. ""The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.""

The headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement. The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon, the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court.

obxqrc,2021-07-01,2021-07-01 19:16:48,Do not fall for Krispy Kreme’s IPO trap: A legacy brand with no organic growth that will remain unprofitable,"TL;DR - Short TF out of this or buy puts once available. A company riddled with a history of fraud, misleading investors, and deceitful accounting tactics is being dumped to the public by a large private equity firm.

My god, this is one of the most blatant cash outs I’ve ever seen. CNBC was pumping this name all morning and interviewed their CEO who touted its new “omni-channel” strategy that will lead to better margins. My BS meter started going off so I decided to read their S-1 and see what was going on under the hood.

Krispy Kreme used to be public in the 2000’s and was acquired by JAB Holdings in 2016 for $1.35 billion following numerous scandals of channel stuffing and overstating revenues. Execs would pretty much order shipments of donuts to be sent to franchises and claim sales to meet quarterly estimates. Wild. There are other irregular accounting techniques used throughout the years along with bullying tactics used against franchise owners but you get the picture, won’t go into detail.

So now after a few years of being private sprinkled with an acquisition (Insomnia Cookies), execs/JAB decided it was time to cash out.

In the presentation, Krispy Kreme emphasizes its strong revenue growth. This is a trap. Their organic growth is flat +1% at most when you strip out revenues from their debt heavy acquisition which is why their margins are just awful now and will not improve. It also excludes new shops that were recently opened because it does not matter if you are growing as a company if you can’t achieve economies of scale. You see this a lot with companies who know they can’t be profitable - emphasize revenue growth! 

Krispy Kreme shouldn’t trade at more than 1x its revenue until it proves it can be profitable through some miraculous turnaround. At a $3 billion market cap currently, I forecast it is nearly 40% overvalued. This should be a $10 stock. Whoever the lead underwriter was for this IPO deserves a raise after pulling such a ridiculous multiple. I guess that’s why companies go public when the market is at all-time highs.",5884,669,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/obxqrc/do_not_fall_for_krispy_kremes_ipo_trap_a_legacy/,all,Company Discussion,0.95

They go on to say that just because they are down this year and indexes are up, it's actually not that bad because the mega-caps are hiding the true state of the market.

Well, let's look at the data shall we...

Here are the YTD gains of a whole bunch of indexes from all the industries that I could think of, most of which don't have many of the aforementioned mega-caps in it:

VGT: +32.99% (Technology)  
XLF: +34.87% (Financial)  
XLE: +47.15% (Energy)  
XLI: +22.38& (Industrials)  
XLV: +24.99% (Healthcare)  
DBC: +43.37% (Commodities)  
PAVE: +37.90% (Infrastructure)  
AVUV: +42.18 (Small Cap Value)  
SCHD: +27.87% (Dividends)  
SMH: +43.21% (Semiconductors)  
ITA: +13.16% (Aerospace and Defense)  
TRVL: +6.82% (Travel)

As can be seen, every major sector of the market is green for the year.  Even travel and aerospace, two of the hardest hit sectors, are up YTD.  Every single other sector is up at least 20%.  It would take an objectively bad investment plan to pick only losers out of this sea of green.

So can we please stop with the BS that a handful of companies are propping up a dying market.  If you are down this year, you really need to review your investing decisions because you are almost certainly investing in companies with poor fundamentals that have been driven entirely by hype and/or trading options in a way that is pure gambling.  I just hope that you are taking the right lessons away from this year.  Please consider putting the majority of your money into broad market index funds.

 New US requirements will put Tesla under pressure to open up its EV charging network to rivals, per Reuters.

The automaker's SuperCharger network has more stations in the US than any other charging company, but they can connnect only to plugs used by Tesla cars.

 ""We do understand that Tesla is looking to tweak their system to be more open access. So, if they do reach that point and meet those eligibility requirements, they certainly will be eligible for funding,"" Stuart Anderson, head of Iowa's transportation development division, told Reuters.

Tesla has already had a boost from the Biden administration's EV push in February, when the DOT tweaked its $7,500 tax credit consumer incentive plan to include more eligible models by expanding the definition of an SUV. That increased the potential demand for some of Tesla's models. 

Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with two White House officials last month to discuss ramping up EV production and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes the legislation on charging equipment.

Musk has spoken in the past about opening up the Supercharger network, but hasn't moved publicly to let others in. Tesla is dominant in chargers in the US, and it has a huge private network of more than 40,000 EV chargers globally.",5832,937,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1117dd2/tesla_faces_a_75_billion_ultimatum_open_up_its/,all,Unknown,0.94

Trump's announcement was light on details. It did not say whether the duties will target films on streaming platforms and those shown in theaters, nor did it specify if the tariffs will be calculated based on production costs or box office revenue.

Streaming pioneer Netflix could particularly be at risk, as it relies on its global production network to produce content for international audiences. Its shares slumped 4.9% in premarket trading, leading a slide in media stocks.

Paul Pelosi, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, made a stock purchase of over $1 million in a computer chip company just weeks before a potential vote in Congress which would give a massive subsidy to the industry. 

 Mr. Pelosi made a purchase of between $1 million and $5 million [shares of Nvidia](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/stocks), a semiconductor company, according to a disclosure filing made by Speaker Pelosi's office. He exercised 200 call options, or 20,000 shares, the disclosure states. The disclosure raised eyebrows, as Reuters reported that the Senate could vote on a bill that contains billions of dollars in subsidies within the semiconductor industry as early as Tuesday. 

Curtis Houck, managing editor of right-leaning media watchdog NewsBusters, said it was ""no accident that the liberal media have made the decision to ignore"" the story that could damage Pelosi. 

""For those that are aware of it, they have zero comprehension and/or shame to realize how it's a quintessential story of how the elites work for their own financial benefit, not that of the American people,"" Houck told Fox News Digital. 

Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi's office has attempted to distance the House Speaker from her husband’s recent stock trades. 

""The Speaker does not own any stocks. As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the Speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked ‘SP’ for Spouse. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions,"" spokesman Drew Hammill told FOX Business. 

In 2020, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, N.C., and other high-profile lawmakers came under fire for stock sales in the run-up to the COVID-19 pandemic that were suspected to have been made based on confidential information about the pending outbreak. CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and NBC all covered the story. ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" even featured a lengthy commentary about it. 

 Charlie Gasparino appeared on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Monday to discuss whether the move could be insider trading. 

""This dude is a rising star on Wall Street,"" Gasparino joked before taking a serious tone. 

""Obviously this brings up the notion, is this insider trading? Is she giving him some tips? We should point out that the SEC and the DOJ have brought cases on insider tips via pillow talk. Trust me on this. It’s happened,"" he said. ""I don’t believe this hits the insider trading bar… a lot of information about this legislation was bouncing around, it has to be material, non-public, stolen, misappropriated. It kind of doesn’t hit those barriers. But what this does hit is limousine liberalism, arrogance on steroids."" ",5801,455,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w2x1ts/pelosis_husband_buying_over_1_million_of_computer/,all,Unknown,0.92

Cramer might say whatever but it’s your job to research into the stock you buy. 

You don’t actually own the stock of the Chinese company shares that are bought via American or any other world exchanges. CCP laws do not allow foreigners to own shares in a Chinese entity. You actually own shares of a shell company located in the Cayman Islands that has the same name as the Chinese stock you own. This shell company has certain economic agreements with the Chinese company so that the share holders of the shell company get economic benefits. You can read more in the below link. 

This kind of a structure leads to a lot of issues. One of them is low blowing American investors after the Chinese companies becomes profitable. Basically Chinese companies are listed in the US and use US investors capital to become profitable and then are taken private at a low price before re-listing in China for a far higher price. 

Then there are risks of the CCP out right invalidating your shell company shares if CCP considers your shares as foreign ownership. This depends on how the shell company shares are related to the Chinese company. Most of the shell companies are shown as a subsidiary of the Chinese company. So the CCP can consider owning shares of a shell company of a Chinese company subsidiary as foreign ownership and invalidate those shares. The below Bloomberg link has more about this as well. 

And then there are accounting issues. The standards of listed Chinese and American company accounting requirements are different. We already have an example for this - luckin coffee.

Don’t listen to the big media platforms too much!","So lately the market has been going down and people might have gotten some bloody days in their portfolios. The correction has affected tech the most as the Nasdaq is about 8% from its all time highs.

The correction has happened because of number one: Rising treasury yields and number two: Sector rotation. Reopening plays are currently the trend that big money likes and money has gone there recently. 

This doesn’t mean that tech is bad in the long term. Stocks go down sometimes and this is the moment that it’s happening. But there is a silver lining to this story...

This gives us a good opportunity get your favourite stocks at a cheaper price. Averaging down is a very delightful thing to do and this is a perfect opportunity. And even if we continue to go down, it’s ok, since you can average down even more.

Another thing that I want to say is that you shouldn’t listen to the media too much. It’s their job to create havoc and drama in the stock market. Their opinions change every week almost, and it’s kinda funny sometimes. One week they say that you shouldn’t sell and another day reporters tell us how big tech is in a bad place and you should move to industrials, travel, etc. 

You have YOUR own plan. Do your plan and don’t listen to those whose job is to dramatize things. The stock market needs patience. Investing is for the long run.

rqf6mk,2021-12-28,2021-12-28 07:51:12,The SEC Is Going Too Easy on Insider Trading - Investors need to know more about executives’ stock-selling plans.,"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-12-28/the-sec-is-going-too-easy-on-insider-trading

At long last, the Securities and Exchange Commission has sketched out a plan to address a difficult issue in the U.S. stock market: how and when corporate insiders, who inevitably have better information than the investing public, can legally trade in the shares of their companies.

The proposal is good, as far as it goes. But it could do a lot more to assure regular investors that insiders aren’t taking advantage of them.

Under current rules, executives and directors can largely avoid charges of illegal insider trading by setting up a predetermined schedule of sales or purchases, known as a 10b5-1 plan. Yet if they know that their company is about to do a big deal or report some bad news, there are still plenty of ways they can use such plans to act on the information. They can set one up for a single trade and act on it the next business day. They can set up multiple plans, then cancel the disadvantageous ones at any moment. It’s hard for the public to understand what’s going on, because many of the relevant details of the plans typically aren’t disclosed or are hard to find.

Now the SEC is moving to make the plans harder to game. Its proposed new rule would establish a 120-day cooling-off period before a first trade can be executed — long enough to erase any informational advantage the insider might have when a plan is created. It would limit single-trade plans to one per year, and effectively disallow executives to have multiple plans simultaneously. All these are positive changes. But in other areas, particularly public disclosure, the SEC’s proposal falls short.

Right now, when an executive creates or terminates a 10b5-1 plan, it’s up to the company to decide whether or not to disclose the move. For example, as far back as 2004, Cisco Systems would regularly file 8-K disclosures about such plans, including the executive’s name, the number of shares and the timeframe for the sales. But starting in 2018, the company stopped providing that level of detail, with no explanation. Absent any formal rules, the company and its lawyers could pick and choose what they wanted to reveal.

The new proposal would require companies to disclose the plans in their quarterly 10-Q financial reports, with some added information (on stock options, for example) in their annual 10-K reports. That’s not good enough. To be truly useful to investors, the disclosure should happen as soon as the plans are created or canceled – for example, under 8-K rules that require filing within four business days, as the SEC’s own investor advisory committee recommended.

Why would the SEC go against investors’ recommendations? Most likely, to satisfy the two Republicans among the agency’s five commissioners – one of whom, Elad Roisman, publicly stated that “this wasn’t the rule I would have written.” The proposal ultimately garnered unanimous support, a rarity in these times of political divisiveness. But even the modest disclosures it requires could yet be watered down or eliminated when corporate law firms start chiming in.

Recent history isn’t encouraging. The SEC was actually more ambitious in 2002, when it proposed that 10b5-1 plans be subject to 8-K disclosure. But various commenters, including large brokerage firms such as Charles Schwab, complained that the requirement would “confuse investors.” Others objected to the added paperwork. The idea was dropped.

As an avid reader of SEC filings, I’ve long argued that more and better disclosure benefits all investors, even if it means a bit more work for the folks that prepare these documents. The latest proposals, assuming they survive corporate lobbying, are a step in the right direction. But they still won’t provide nearly enough information in a way that matters for ordinary investors.",5699,273,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rqf6mk/the_sec_is_going_too_easy_on_insider_trading/,all,Industry Discussion,0.97

We first reported on Koguan in 2021 when the little-known investor became the third largest individual shareholder in Tesla behind Elon Musk and Larry Ellison.

The Indonesian-born Chinese American businessman is better known for founding SHI International Corp, a large private IT company that made him a billionaire. He is also involved in academia and philanthropy.

Koguan has previously described himself as an “Elon fanboy” (the featured image above is him and Musk) and believes in Tesla’s mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D., WVa.), said the $1.7 trillion Build Back Better social spending and climate change bill is a “no” as far as he is concerned.

The centrist Democrat told Fox News Sunday he “cannot vote to continue with this peice of legislation.” The bill, which Senate Democrats had hoped to pass by Christmas, stalled last week after prolonged negotiations between Manchin and President Joe Biden.

“I’ve tried everything humanly possible,” Manchin said Sunday. “I can’t get there.”

The comments were certain to provoke a backlash by progressive members of the party, who wanted to bundle the social spending plan with the already enacted plan to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure to ensure its passage.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.) told CNN on Sunday he would push to bring Build Back Better to a vote in the Senate, to force Manchin to explain to the public why he opposed it. “If he doesn’t have the courage to do the right thing for the working familiies of West Virginia and America, let him vote no in front of the whole world,” Sanders told CNN.

The bill, which the House already passed, includes spending on childcare, early education, and child tax credits. It also aims to lower prescription drug prices, expand Medicare and push for investments in clean energy, among other initiatives.

Last week, Biden conceded the Senate would likely push consideration for the bill into the new year after trying to convince Manchin to support it. Manchin has balked at the dollar amount of the spending and some provisions such as paid family leave, saying the spending would add to the deficit at a time when consumers are already paying higher prices for food, fuel and other household needs.

“This is a no on this legislation,” Manchin said.",5659,1440,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rjzlr9/manchin_says_no_on_bidens_build_back_better_plan/,all,Industry News,0.93
1j9mlkx,2025-03-12,2025-03-12 11:26:21,Tesla investor survey shows 85% believe Elon Musk’s politics are having ‘negative’ or ‘extremely negative’ impact on company,"More than eight out of every 10 respondents to a Morgan Stanley survey believe Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s controversial political activities are hurting his business.

In total, 85% of the 245 participants polled by the firm believe Musk’s foray into politics has either had a “negative” or “extremely negative” impact on business fundamentals. The majority of respondents also expect Tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey.

While a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he’s become a rising figure in international and American politics. It also comes at a pivotal point for Tesla’s stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year.

When asked about Musk’s efforts with U.S. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a “negative” effect on the company. Another 40% said they were having an “extremely negative” impact.

On the other hand, 3% said they were “positive” for the business. Meanwhile, 12% called them “insignificant.”

To be sure, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. He also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of Tesla stock. The survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on Tuesday afternoon.

Jonas also asked about expectations for the company’s performance. In a separate question, 59% said they anticipated Tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. What’s more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. That comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent reports of vandalism could spook potential customers.

Just 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years.

Musk’s political profile has grown after his public support of President Donald Trump in the runup up to last year’s election and his subsequent role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla executive’s efforts to slash the federal government’s spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly.

Musk acknowledged in an interview with Fox Business on Monday that his high-profile role in Trump’s administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include X and SpaceX, “with great difficulty.” That day, Tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their worst session since 2020.

Despite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate Tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. Around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220.

After a New York Times report last week unearthed criticisms of Musk’s team from members of Trump’s cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on Tuesday. Trump evaluated five Tesla models parked at the White House after the president said on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support.

Trump also said he would declare violence at Tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism.

lsyfcs,2021-02-26,2021-02-26 09:10:19,What caused stocks to dump yesterday: the unwinding of $50B worth of bonds,"Last week and earlier this week, I've been posting warnings about watching out for increased volatility leading into March, and particularly toward the end of March, which is the end of Q1. We're going to see unwinding of massive positions in the pandemic and tech stocks that were successful in 2020 as institutions and professionals will be forced to change their portfolios to more value oriented stocks that will perform better in high interest rate conditions: commodities, energy, high free cash flow businesses, industrials and financials. I refer to this as ""rotation"" where portfolios evolve from being focused on one sector or asset class to another over time. This Spring, these rotations may not occur in a slow, calm and orderly way. 

Monday, as I said in an earlier post this week, I liquidated most of my positions in the hot stocks of 2020, including EVs, and began focusing on interest-rate proof businesses. These are businesses with lower long term debt, good free cash flow, actual positive profit margins, and good balance sheets. I'm just holding long positions in outright cash purchases of stock, so I don't have complicated positions to ""unwind"" (I just sell a stock to get out of a position). However, institutional and professional investors, and hedge funds, have more complicated and leveraged portfolios. 

We can't expect the unwinding of positions of so-called ""whales"" (big players) in the market to always be orderly or calm as the end of Q1 approaches. 

Yesterday's market dump appears to have been triggered by one or more whales forcefully selling $50B of bonds into a reluctant buyer's market. The below is a good article from Bloomberg but it's premium content so I'll summarize it below because it answers the question, *Why are bond yields spiking despite the Federal Reserve setting its interest rates to banks so low and WTF is going on in the bond market?*

[Chaotic Treasury Selloff Fueled by $50 Billion of Unwinding](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/chaotic-treasury-selloff-fueled-by-50-billion-position-unwind)(Paywall)

* **A massive dump of $50B in bonds suggest one (or a few) positions were unwound by one or more whales**  

> “It wasn’t an orderly selloff and certainly didn’t appear to be driven by any obvious fundamental continuation or extension of the reflation thesis,” wrote NatWest Markets strategist Blake Gwinn in a note to clients. 

* **""Fundamental decoupling"" between low interest rates and a heating economy**

Bond and lending pros are rejecting the Federal Reserve's low-interest view, which is at odds with 6-7% growth projected due to stimulus plans and rebound from the pandemic and Powell's talk of ""maximum employment"" plans

> The bond market’s divergence from a fundamental backdrop was most evident at the shorter-end of the curve. Eurodollar contracts -- which are priced off Libor -- collapsed in record volumes as traders repriced their expectations for the path of Fed rates with few obvious catalysts.

* **What exactly happened?  5-year Treasury notes jumped 22 points, and spreads associated with those notes jumped 24 points**

> The main protagonist in the bond market was the five-year Treasury note, a maturity often associated with long-term Fed rate expectations, where yields closed 22 basis point higher on the day. The so-called butterfly-spread index -- a measure of how the note is performing against its two- and 10-year peers -- jumped 24 basis points, the worst daily performance for the sector since 2002.

> Markets now see a Fed hike by March 2023 compared to mid-2023 previously, and have priced in rates over 50 basis points higher by 2024.

> But in remarks this week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell offered reassurance that policy would continue to be supportive and look beyond a temporary pick-up in inflation, especially from a low base. While Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida expressed cautious optimism on the outlook, he said it would “take some time” to restore the economy to pre-pandemic levels.

* **Bond buyers who disagree with the Fed were ""on strike"" yesterday and created a ""liquidity drought""** 

> A number of more “technical-style” factors were in the mix, against a backdrop of a good-old-fashioned buyers strike...

> A lack of bond market liquidity, just when traders needed it most [i.e. during a big dump of $50B in bonds]

* **Also high frequency trading exists in the bond market too, apparently, and they suddenly disappeared yesterday in a market that was used to their presence, at the same time buyers thinned out**

> “We think that a steep decline in market depth contributed to the outsized moves in yields today,” wrote JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Jay Barry in a note to clients. Barry showed how the share of high-frequency traders in the Treasury market -- which has been on an increasing trend -- tends to retreat rapidly as volatility spikes.

I expect to see more volatility as positions from 2020 unwind and people create whole new portfolios for post-pandemic 2021. This is a good time to look at which stocks are the ones doing well each day and why. 

Disclaimer: Not a financial professional

Edit: I plan to reenter tech stocks hardcore once these whales are done with whatever BS they do at the end of every quarter whenever there are big changes.

__________________________

Edit 2: Here's an addition of more material offered by /u/TomatoeHaven from other references (I have not checked them)

**What impact, if any, does the Fed have on Treasury Yield?**

Note: Treasury yield briefly topped the 1.6% level on Thursday and traded at its highest level in more than a year, raising concern for investors across asset classes.

“To be sure, if bond yields continue to rise and there is a smooth rotation out of growth and defensive stocks into value and cyclical stocks, the Fed will remain sanguine,” strategist Albert Edwards of Societe Generale said in a note. “But the risk is growing that with so many bubbles blown by the Fed something will burst soon.”

The prospect of podcast riches led to aggressive investments in celebrity deals and original programming for what appeared a sky’s-the-limit media frontier  
Spotify spent more than $1 billion to build a podcasting empire. It struck splashy deals with Kim Kardashian, the Obamas and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It paid $286 million for a pair of podcast studios and spent $250,000 and more an episode on exclusive shows to lure new listeners.  
The bet hasn’t paid off.   
Most of its shows aren’t profitable, according to people familiar with the matter, and the company has recently cut staff and programming to slow its losses. The company, which has struggled to report consistent profits, lost €527 million, equivalent to about $565 million, in the six months ending in June, on €6.2 billion in revenue.   
No one in the business is making much money on podcasts, but Spotify, which has spent far more on the medium than its rivals, has more to lose than most. Spotify’s competitors, including Amazon, Apple and Google, tech behemoths with their own audiostreaming services, have other, more profitable businesses.

Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances, and reinstate his compensation.McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case $345 million, well short of the billions they initially requested.

Robinhood said it expects fourth quarter revenue no greater than $325 million. The company sees account growth in line with the 660,000 opened in the third quarter of 2021.

“For the three months ending December 31, 2021, we anticipate that many of the factors that impacted our third quarter results, such as seasonal headwinds and lower retail trading activity, may persist,” the company said in a press release.

But its EV business needs a hit product and none is on the horizon. And the company’s booming battery business, a Q1 bright spot, will suffer from Trump’s tariffs.

The problems Tesla now faces have been exacerbated by Musk joining the Trump Administration as a ""special government employee"" — declining profit margins, intensifying competition and a tarnished brand image. And they show no signs of disappearing any time soon, even if Musk becomes a more active CEO again. Worse, it's becoming clear Musk has run out of ideas for how to fix them, instead fixating on an uncertain future focused on robotaxis and humanoid robots.

nrou4z,2021-06-03,2021-06-03 17:43:22,"With wood prices so high, curiosity struck me. Why is wood so expensive and where is all the money going?","Wood is crazy expensive right now. and most seem to believe that the cost is driven by the demand for wood. But financial statements from 4 of the top 5 companies argues another excuse. According to [Sawmill DB](https://www.sawmilldatabase.com/productiontoplist.php?continent_id=998), the top 5 production mills in the US are: West Fraser, Canfor, Weyerhaeuser, Georgia Pacific (Not PT), and Resolute forests. Since GP is not publicly traded everything I share will not include them. 

One thing I noticed with all of these companies is that in the past year their stock price has sky rocketed. 

* West Fraser: 130% 

* Canfor 180%

* Weyerhaeuser 80%

* Resolute Forest **500%**

Why is their price doing this? it isn't like wsb is simping over it. 

Looking at all of their filings for the SEC tells you exactly why their price has jumped. it will also tell you why the price of wood has also skyrocketed. and it isnt a jump in demand that caused their price to raise or the price of wood to raise. These companies are just selling them for higher prices and pocketing the excess profit.

There are 4 data points that support the artificial jump in prices. Inventories, Sales, COGS, and New Earnings. below is the data for all 4 companies.

**West Fraser**

COGS | 1,039,000,000 | 630,000,000 | 65%
Selling, G and A | 78,000,000 | 41,000,000 | 90%
Net Earnings | 665,000,000 | 9,000,000(no this is not a typo) | **7289%**

*their acquisition of norbord was 707,000,000 of that unfortunately COGS for it isn't available. 

West Fraser has seen a jump in net earnings of over 7k percent. In one year they grew their net earnings by over 72x. COGS only increased by 65% which means the price of lumber or getting the lumber hasn't changed. This jump in COGS is likely due to Norbord. So even taking that out of the equation would mean they doubled their sales in a year. That is absolutely nuts. That is a profit margin that went from 2.4% to 66%. that is not normal, either. but we aren't done lets look at the other companies.

Some interesting things to point out:

* all these companies have a significant increase in profit margin. 2 of them were able to reverse their position and get positive earnings, while the other 2 were able to increase their net earnings by significant amounts. 

* in 3 of these cases, the increase in sale revenue was something to brag about. while the remaining company looks like they're geniuses for the growth they had. All of them did this with out having a huge jump in COGS. I include West Fraser in this because they acquired a company in Q1 of this year. for this reason I bet their COGS would like the same withholding their new acquisition. 

* Although ""Selling, G&A"" is not nearly as important or necessary as the others it is still necessary to show that any increase in lumber is due to labor. I assume labor is incorporated in COGS but I want to provide this for anyone reading this and wondering if they may be putting labor into a different classification. That was my first though when I saw COGS didnt jump as high as sales.

* Inventories for all companies were marginally impacted. The growth they experienced I'd say is probably just volatility due to seasonal reasons. but an interesting tidbit I want to share is that all of these companies blame the increase in prices on the pandemic claiming that it had a negative impact on the supply side. but as you can tell all companies have a growth in their inventories. All but Resolute Forest value their inventories using the lower of costs. meaning that discounting the growth in inventories should be done to a minimum. They also blame an increase of demand from people working at home for the increase in business. This makes sense. But when you include the fact that the price of wood has doubled since last year it's a little bit unreasonable to say that the massive increase in revenue is due strictly to demand side. More than likely they increased wood prices is to make up for any lack in profits they would have gotten and now they don't want to lower them because they see how much more money they're making. 

Everything I shared with you is because a friend at work noticed this with west fraser. I wanted to confirm that this was a market wide phenomenon. I think it is safe to say that the increase in wood isnt market force related but rather artificially inflated reasons. Let me know what you think in the comments. This is my first time ever sharing research I did and If I missed a crucial step I would love the critique. If I get good at doing this I will probably submit more findings I have in the future.

1eewy23,2024-07-29,2024-07-29 07:18:45,"McDonald's earnings, revenue miss estimates as consumer pullback worsens ","McDonald’s on Monday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed analysts’ expectations as same-store sales declined across every division.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.97 adjusted vs. $3.07 expected

Revenue: $6.49 billion vs. $6.61 billion expected

The fast-food giant reported second-quarter net income of $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, down from $2.31 billion, or $3.15 per share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to the future sale of its South Korean business and other items, McDonald’s earned $2.97 per share.

Its quarterly revenue of $6.49 billion was flat compared with the year-ago period.

McDonald’s same-store sales shrank 1%, missing StreetAccount estimates for growth of 0.4%. It’s the first time companywide same-store sales have fallen since the fourth quarter of 2020.

In the U.S., McDonald’s same-store sales decreased 0.7% for the quarter. A year ago, the chain reported U.S. same-store sales growth of 10.3%, thanks to its popular Grimace Birthday Meal.

But in the 12 months since, more consumers have cut back their restaurant spending, particularly at fast-food chains, which they no longer see as a good deal. McDonald’s said foot traffic to its U.S. restaurants fell during the quarter.

Executives previously warned that the competition for customers had become more fierce as the consumer environment weakened.McDonald’s is leaning into discounts to bring back diners. The chain launched a $5 meal deal in late June, five days before the end of the quarter.

A week ago, the company told its U.S. system that it plans to extend the value meal past the planned four-week runtime and said that it’s bringing back customers.

McDonald’s is trying to lure in diners outside of the U.S., too. Its international operated markets division, which includes large segments like France and Germany, saw its same-store sales slide 1.1% in the quarter.

The company’s international developmental licensed markets unit, which includes China and Japan, reported same-store sales declines of 1.3%. McDonald’s is still dealing with the fallout from boycotts of the brand in the Middle East, and sales in China continue to struggle.

Here’s some DD.,"They are the forefront in the AI Autonomous cyber security software market, there is no other competitors besides Google, but does not have the patents and broad variety of software that BB provides. Partnerships with the 19 of the top 25 EV companies which make up 61% of the EV market. Not to mention the recent deal with ticker: BIDU to provide their QNX System to over 175 million EV’s. They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs. 

They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies such as Sybase! A billion dollar software company with reported 55 consecutive profitable quarterly earning reports before they were bought out by SAP. Chen also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.

If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales. 

Edit: I also want to point out by looking at the TA from February 2nd on, BB is the only stock with a higher moving average to that of GME AMC and NOK. Throughout last week we can see it breaking the meme trend and acting on its own. Sorry I’m not sure how to add pictures but if you have the resources, you’ll see if you overlay all 4 stocks, they move very similar, but BB is the only one that breaks out right before market close. 

Edit 2: There’s a rumor that BB executives sold shares with the incentive to leave, remit ownership from BB, or have concerns of company being overvalued. Shares given to these executives are part of their salary compensation, so under company policy, they have every right to sell shares for capital gains. You can google search this yourself if you don’t believe so.

lsfk88,2021-02-25,2021-02-25 15:06:59,Indicators Explained For Newbies in Stock Market,"I along with probably many others here are new to the trading world. GME sparked our interest but we know this isn't how the market usually works. With that being said, I've been doing some research on the different features and functions provided in different web applications so I figured I'd share some basic info here to try and help some others.

Here is a very basic explanation of the different indicators I have got. I guess some of you already have in your charts.

[Macro sentiment](https://cindicator.com/macrosentiment) \- This gives weekly indicators and works best when you have a stock portfolio also if you have option trading. Their risk factor is also improved, through their collective intelligence indicators platform which is an interactive platform between the team and its users where they ask questions about the future trends of the market.  
[BOLL (Bollinger)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/102201.asp) \- This finds the position of a security within Bollinger Bands. %B is simply a percentage measure of a security’s location between the bands. %B can be lower than 0 or higher than 100 if price moves outside the bands. Generally speaking, a %B near or above 100 can suggest an overbought market, while a value near or below 0 can indicate an oversold market.

[DC (Donchian Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/donchianchannels/) \- Are used in technical analysis to measure a market's volatility. It is a banded indicator, similar to Bollinger Bands %B. Besides measuring a market's volatility, Donchian Channels are primarily used to identify potential breakouts or overbought/oversold conditions when price reaches either the Upper or Lower Band. These instances would indicate possible trading signals.

[EMA (Exponential Moving Average)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) \- This is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment (like a stock or commodity) over time. The EMA is a type of weighted moving average (WMA) that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data.

[IC (Ichimoku Cloud)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ichimoku-cloud.asp) \- A collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels, as well as momentum and trend direction. It does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on the chart. It also uses these figures to compute a ""cloud"" which attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future.

[KC (Keltner Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502266-keltner-channels-kc/) \- A banded indicator similar to Bollinger Bands and Moving Average Envelopes. They consist of an Upper Envelope above a Middle Line as well as a Lower Envelope below the Middle Line. The Middle Line is a moving average of price over a user-defined time period. Either a simple moving average or an exponential moving average are typically used. The Upper and Lower Envelopes (user defined) are set a range away from the Middle Line. This can be a multiple of the daily high/low range, or more commonly a multiple of the Average True Range.

MA (Moving Average) - A simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks or any time period the trader chooses. There are advantages to using a moving average in your trading, as well as options on what type of moving average to use. Moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame, suiting both long-term investors and short-term traders.

Pivot Point - A technical analysis indicator, or calculations, used to determine the overall trend of the market over different time frames. The pivot point itself is simply the average of the intraday high and low, and the closing price from the previous trading day. On the subsequent day, trading above the pivot point is thought to indicate ongoing bullish sentiment, while trading below the pivot point indicates bearish sentiment.

SAR - The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder to determine the direction that an asset is moving. The indicator is also referred to as a stop and reverse system, which is abbreviated as SAR. It aims to identify potential reversals in the price movement of traded assets. It can also be used to provide entry and exit points.

SuperTrend - This indicator works well in a trending market but can give false signals when a market is trading in a range. It uses the ATR (average true range) as part of its calculation which takes into account the volatility of the market. The ATR is adjusted using the multiplier setting which determines how sensitive the indicator is.",5374,314,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lsfk88/indicators_explained_for_newbies_in_stock_market/,all,Advice,0.96

mhvteb,2021-04-01,2021-04-01 09:55:07,I tried to predict the stock market every day in March. Here's how it went - and what I learned.,"Every single day this month, I tried to do the one thing that everybody says you shouldn't try to do. I tried predict the exact daily movements of the stock market -- specifically, the daily direction, high, and low of the NASDAQ -- and posted my best guess in the daily discussion forum.

I had to pay incredibly close attention to the stock market every day to do it. Every single morning, I did technical and market analysis to try to keep from publicly embarrassing myself. I learned more about the stock market this month than I have in my entire time trading.

To celebrate one month of predictions, I wanted to take a look back at the month of March and share some of the things I've learned.

Here's the first one:

**I can't predict the stock market.**

*Damn it.* I really thought I'd be able to do it.

You can see my [full scorecard here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/MkMAC), but it isn't really anything to brag about. Here's how I did:

* **Direction:** 65% correct
* **Daily high:** Median error of 0.26%
* **Daily low:** Median error of 0.36%

I was always more interested in the highs and lows than the direction, but *damn* is 65% ever a bad score. I've looked into it -- if I'd just predicted whatever the premarket said, I would've been right 74% of the time.

Part of the problem was this:

**When J. Powell talks, there's a 66% chance the market will tank.**

When J. Powell talked, my prediction was wrong more often than it was right -- and usually by a lot. On average, my prediction for the daily low was off by 1.37% whenever he spoke.

I wanted to look into that, so I tested out some of the big narratives we heard this month

[Click here to see that research visualized.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)

J. Powell used to be able to pump the market -- but since 2020, I learned, the market has turned red on 66% of the days that he has either made a speech or a public testimony, with the market closing, on average, down 1.24%.

**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**

I've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: ""Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?""

One thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.

AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.

I saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: ""Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?"" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. 

**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**

One of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the ""bond yield"". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.

It never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.

I'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:

* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March
* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.
* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.
* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech

**... but sometimes it is.**

That doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.

Another huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.

This story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.

People really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.

**I still think the stock market can be predicted**

When I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.

They probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.

Everything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.

If you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street. I'm increasingly convinced of that, and I believe that my predictions will get better as time goes on.

yo2j3k,2022-11-06,2022-11-06 15:57:56,Meta Is Preparing to Notify Employees of Large-Scale Layoffs This Week,"Meta [US:META] Platforms Inc. is planning to begin large-scale layoffs this week, according to people familiar with the matter, in what could be among the largest round in a recent spate of tech job cuts after the industry’s rapid growth during the pandemic.

The layoffs are expected to affect many thousands of employees and an announcement is planned to come as soon as Wednesday, according to the people. Meta reported more than 87,000 employees at the end of September. Company officials already told employees to cancel nonessential travel beginning this week, the people said.

The planned layoffs would be the first broad headcount reductions to occur in the company’s 18-year history. While smaller on a percentage basis than the cuts at Twitter Inc. this past week, which hit about half of that company’s staff, the number of Meta employees expected to lose their jobs could be the largest to date at a major technology corporation in a year that has seen a tech industry retrenchment. 

A spokesman for Meta declined to comment, referring The Wall Street Journal to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s recent statement that the company would “focus our investments on a small number of high priority growth areas.”

“So that means some teams will grow meaningfully, but most other teams will stay flat or shrink over the next year,” he said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 26. “In aggregate, we expect to end 2023 as either roughly the same size, or even a slightly smaller organization than we are today.”

The Journal reported in September that Meta was planning to cut expenses by at least 10% in the coming months, in part through staff reductions.

IT TOOK ME A FEW HOURS TO MAKE THIS SPREADSHEET AND I WOULD LIKE TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPENING AND DUPLICATING THE SHEET, PLEASE HELP PAY IT FORWARD.**

Disclaimer: I originally created this tool for WSB, but it looks like I am muted there for some reason, so I figured I would share on some other subs where people are also talking about GME.

This whole experience has been (and will be) a crazy trip, but you don't want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth. **HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY.** Everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance. Some of us can afford to YOLO away six-figure investments, while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand.

Your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing, and how much profits you would be happy taking. I'm not here to tell you what your strategy should be, but I did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself: [Exit Strategy Calculator (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13twJC8Ldy3p7iS7fp5htOjfhTYZIE_Fqa5Rn9wgqv8c/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

**HOW TO USE THE EXIT STRATEGY PLANNER**

\- Note 1: **This is for shares only**. I'm not smart enough to make this work for options.

\- Note 2: The link I provided is READ ONLY, so the first step is to **make a copy** for your own use (File --> make a copy)

\- **Now, enter your current position.** Provide the number of shares you have in A3, and your average cost basis in B3 (these cells are highlighted in yellow). Your total investment will automatically calculate in C3.

\- **Columns E-F are the ROI calculator.** Column F tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the ROI listed in Column E. Column G tells you what your total value would be at that share price.

\- **Columns I-K are your break-even analysis**, which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling X number of your shares, and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price. *You will probably want to adjust the #s in Column I based on how many shares you currently have in your position*. Columns J & K will automatically update when you do.

\- **Columns M-N calculate your profits at different share prices.** How much money will you make if you sell when GME hits $80? What about $100, or $250, or even $1,000? These columns will tell you. Feel free to adjust the share prices in column M if you want, but I have most of the big milestones covered.

\- **Columns P-R are your exit strategy planner.** *You will need to provide the following information: # of shares (if any) you want to hold long term, post-squeeze \[cell P4\]. Maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing \[Q4\]. Profit amount you would be 100% happy cashing out with no FOMO of future gains \[R3\].* Cell Q6 will calculate your ""worst case scenario"" sell price. **Set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses** to the amount you entered in Q4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares. Cell Q7 will calculate your ""best case scenario"" sell price. **Set a limit order at this price to cash out with your ""100% satisfied profit""** you entered in R4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares.

\- **Columns T-V is an incremental sales planner.** Some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit (ie sell 10 shares when it hits $100, another 10 at $150, etc.). Simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point \[column U\], and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues, net profit, and remaining shares.

TLDR: Use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on GME when all of the shorts are officially squeezed. Make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and risk/reward preferences.

Of course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments, but let's be honest... half of us seem to be all in on GME right now. Big week ahead, may all of our profits be plentiful!

**EDIT:** A few people have mentioned that the file traffic was too high and it was not allowing them to make a copy. Fear not! I have made some alternate sheets you can use instead (they are all the same).

I will go and read about the companies I learn from those posts and find it very interesting. I am very impressed that someone was able to pick that company as the next big thing. 

I think it is a good skill to learn. Please suggest how I can learn it. 
How do you discover such companies? What is the criteria you use to determine that a particular company has growth potential ? 
Are there any websites or tools you recommend ? 


DISCLAIMER: I am not very knowledgeable about stocks. I invest in them through index funds. But occasionally I buy individual stocks if I know and like the company, like Costco, Reddit and Apple. I use their products or services daily.

Let's say a person has $25,000 usd in a Roth 401k and that money is in an ETF like VOO. There are no other assets such as real estate, gold or crypto.

What is the best way to reduce the impact from a market crash or collapse.

Could you change say the ETF like VOO if you think a crash will happen to another stock or asset group that would be less volatile and a crash would not impact it as much? Potentially change to foreign assets or something idk, something that would lessen the impact.

I understand markets will go up and down, but is there a way to reduce the impact from a crash?

From my understanding the roth 401k could not be changed to assets like gold easily. One could roll the 401k into a self-directed Gold IRA account that allows for gold investment. I don't really know much more than that and seems a bit complicated and you could lose larger gains after the crash potentially.

Is there any good etf's that you could diversify your portfolio that would be more market crash proof?",0,51,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ny1npl/is_there_a_best_way_to_protect_your_401k_if_there/,new,Advice,0.41

But I also hold some money in Roth, and have some money coming into my traditional Ira soon, like this week. My Roth holds voo, schd, and a tiny amount of Amazon and meta. Don’t ask me why I started that way.

I’ve watched many videos on building a diversified portfolio and using ETFs like voo or schd for growth with moderate risk.

But I don’t feel I understand enough to invest the amount I have coming in and don’t want to lose out.

I understand to place stable and dividend paying stocks into traditional and high growth stocks into Roth. Is it that simple? Does anyone chase speculative stocks? How diverse should I be? When I think about gold, reits, and global stocks, I get scared honestly. It feels overwhelming as I like things simple and straight forward and am not familiar with those assets.

Since the market is generally at ATH, these reciprocal movements make sense as everyone is boosting everyone else's value. But BRK.B is just watching from the sidelines. 

Why?

I suspect even the smartest investors of the firm realize one simple fact: Buffet is about to die, and the news will be on everyone's face, causing a knee jerk reaction along the lines of ""He was irreplacable, the firm will stop making significant gains until true new leadership emerges"".

Which is clearly not true. But humans are spooked easily and many don't know he does not even actively manage the firm anymore.

1nxidln,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 22:34:33,Reddit (RDDT) - Everyone’s Missing What Actually Happened,"
Position: Long 1 contract, Jan 2026 $210 Call (+$362.50)

TL;DR: The 7% drop from “ChatGPT citations declining” is the most misunderstood selloff I’ve seen this year. Google just handed Reddit pricing power on a silver platter.

-----

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED:

Sept 10: Google kills num=100 parameter
→ Search APIs can only pull 10-20 results instead of 100
→ Reddit content (ranked 11-100) disappears from scraped data
→ ChatGPT citations drop from 14% to 2%
→ Stock tanks from $240 to $207

Wall Street sees: “Reddit losing AI relevance”

I see: “Reddit just got monopoly pricing on their content”

-----

THE SETUP EVERYONE’S MISSING:

Before: OpenAI scraped Reddit for free via Google

After: OpenAI must pay Reddit directly for API access

This isn’t Reddit losing value. This is Google eliminating Reddit’s free rider problem.

THE MATH:

Current confirmed deals:

- Google: $60M/year
- OpenAI: ~$60M/year
- Total AI licensing run rate: $200M+

They’re negotiating “dynamic pricing” = pay per use

If usage drives pricing and free access just got killed, what happens to those numbers?

Do the math. It’s not going down.

-----

THE CITATION DROP ACTUALLY PROVES THE THESIS:

Stock moved 14% on an 86% citation drop.

Think about that.

One metric from one AI platform moved a $30B company 14%.

That’s not weakness. That’s dependency.

ChatGPT can’t function without Reddit’s UGC. Neither can Perplexity. Neither can Google’s AI.

They just lost free access.

Now they pay, or their AI gets dumber.

-----

WHY REDDIT WINS THIS:

1. Content moat nobody can replicate

- 100M daily users having real conversations
- Every niche topic covered
- Continuously updated
- 18 years of archived knowledge

1. Q2 fundamentals crushed it

- $501M revenue (+84% YoY)
- Just turned profitable
- 97M DAU (+51% YoY)
- Positive free cash flow

1. AI companies have no alternatives

- Stack Overflow? Smaller, tech-only
- Quora? Dead
- Discord? Private, not indexed
- Twitter? Toxic wasteland
- Where else do you get quality UGC at scale?

1. Google just eliminated their competition

- Can’t scrape Reddit via Google anymore
- Must use Reddit’s direct API
- Reddit sets the price

-----

THE BEAR CASE (because I’m not an idiot):

- Negotiations could fail
- OpenAI might reduce Reddit dependency
- Valuation still rich at 8x sales
- User experience degrading from over-monetization
- Competition could emerge

These are real risks. I’m not ignoring them.

But the risk/reward at $207 after a panic sell on misunderstood news?

That’s the setup I want.

-----

WHAT I’M WATCHING:

Bullish catalysts:

- New OpenAI deal announced (higher rates)
- Q3 earnings showing AI revenue acceleration
- Additional platform partnerships
- Dynamic pricing implementation

Bearish catalysts:

- Failed negotiations
- User growth slowdown
- Continued citation decline without revenue growth
- Management fumbling this opportunity

-----

MY ACTUAL THESIS:

The market saw “citations down” and panic sold.

Smart money should see “free access eliminated, paid access mandatory.”

Google didn’t hurt Reddit. Google just forced every AI company to negotiate directly with Reddit.

And Reddit owns content nobody else has.

That’s pricing power.

The Jan 2026 $210 call gives me:

- 3 months to see Q3 earnings
- Time for new deal announcements
- Exposure to re-rating if market figures this out
- Limited downside (premium paid)

This is 2% of my portfolio. High conviction on thesis, sized appropriately for execution risk.

-----

What am I missing? Where’s the hole in this logic?

Genuinely want to stress test this before adding to the position.

Not financial advice. I own calls. Do your own research.

But if you think I’m wrong, tell me why in the comments.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",709,205,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nxidln/reddit_rddt_everyones_missing_what_actually/,new,Company Discussion,0.89

Insider activity between September 12 and 15 showed seven transactions totaling about $1.52M, with 79% of that value from sales. While that kind of selling can bring short-term pressure, it is often part of normal liquidity behavior for a company scaling at this stage. Against giants like $MSFT and $IBM, $QBTS is differentiating itself by pushing harder on commercialization. With the capital raise complete and adoption trends picking up, 2025 may be the year it proves whether it can hold ground in the broader quantum race.

Commercial traction is becoming clearer too, with bookings in Asia Pacific up 83%. Analysts are pointing to the stronger balance sheet and expanding customer adoption as reasons the outlook looks favorable. I actually made an entry on bitget to test the momentum but decided to exit for now and take more time to study the fundamentals before leaning in further.

Curious to hear how others on this sub are reading the company’s moves. Does the raise, NASA tie-in, and growth in bookings look like the right setup for long-term strength, or do you think the insider selling signals caution?

> The U.S. dollar ended the first half of 2025 with its biggest loss since 1973. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies of the U.S.’s major trading partners, fell about 11% from January through the end of June. That decline also marked the end of a structural bull cycle for the dollar, which started in 2010 and ended in 2024 with an accumulated gain of about 40%. 

> Although the currency strengthened 3.2% in July, recovering some of this year’s depreciation, Morgan Stanley Research expects the decline to continue, possibly adding another 10% in losses by the end of next year.  “We're likely at the intermission rather than the finale,” says David Adams, head of G10 FX Strategy at Morgan Stanley. “The second act for the dollar’s weakening should come over the next 12 months, as U.S. interest rates and growth converge with those of the rest of the world.” 

> The U.S. currency depreciation could have significant impacts for consumers, businesses, investors and ultimately for the overall economy: It would be more expensive for Americans to travel abroad. U.S. assets could be less compelling for foreign investors. Import prices could rise, putting pressure on inflation. On the positive side, however, the weaker dollar could be a boost for American exporters.",5785,355,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nxbr66/the_us_dollar_fell_about_11_against_other/,new,Unknown,0.98

> Elon Musk this week urged his followers to cancel their Netflix  subscriptions over a controversy surrounding an animated show and its creator. Musk on Wednesday posted on his X platform saying, “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids.” The post was in response to an image accusing Netflix of carrying out a “transgender woke agenda.” The controversy seems to stem from conservative backlash over an animated Netflix show, “Dead End: Paranormal Park,” which features a transgender character. The show was canceled in 2023 after two seasons.

> In addition to several anti-trans posts, Musk also responded to a post criticizing alleged statements made by the show’s creator, Hamish Steele, that a prominent conservative X account said “mocked” the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Steele responded to Musk’s callout on rival social media platform Bluesky saying, “It’s probably going to be a very odd day.” Steele also shared a post by TV writer Jack Bernhardt that called “Dead End” a “brilliant show about kind, wonderful characters.” Also this week, vocal conservative activist Robby Starbuck began posting about Netflix, echoing anti-trans sentiments and arguing the company has promoted an ideology that is “hateful to White Americans.” Starbuck, who has repeatedly targeted major corporations in recent months over diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, said in one of his X posts on Netflix, “No one should give this woke company another dime.”

> Analysts say the backlash might not pose as big of a threat to Netflix as Musk may be hoping for. Netflix reported 301.63 million subscribers as of the fourth quarter of 2024, the last time it reported the metric before shifting priority to revenue over user growth. The company has a roughly $490 billion market cap, and its stock is up more than 60% in the past year. Shares lost nearly 5% over the week.

I want to sell my stocks automatically at THAT price, but if I am wrong and it keeps going up, the last thing I want to do is sell right there. I would want to hold on to that stock to see just how high it can climb.

I'm trying to understand the reasons why two tickets of the same company can have differences on their price performance.

During the day, BELFA has gone up about 2%, and BELFB down about 2%.

While I understand than in this case the differences between both tickets are the voting rights and dividend payment, neither of them seem to have changed recently (that I’m aware of),  I don't seem to find a reason why in particular today, those prices are not correlated.

I've searched news about them. I appreciate any hints that help me to understand this.

Thank you!

- “With S&P 500 near record highs, it's time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget it strategy, some experts say

Even amid a federal government shutdown, the S&P 500 climbed to a new all-time high on Thursday.

Yet investors who double down on that index risk overconcentration in big company names.

Here's how experts say to diversify to avoid those risks:

Experts say it may be time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget-it S&P

500-focused strategy, famously touted by legendary investor Warren Buffett.

""The S&P 500 is broken,"" said Michael DeMassa, who is a certified financial planner.

Many investors assume investing in the
S&P 500 index through ETF tickers SPY, VOO or IVV is synonymous with diversification, DeMassa said.

If you can invest in the S&P 500 index for a long time, you will probably do well, said Deva Panambur.

But occasionally the index suffers long periods of underperformance, he said. For example, between 2000 and 2008, the S&P 500 was down by more than 30%.
Wall Street forecasts generally see the index continuing to go up for the foreseeable future.
Still, experts say it's best to choose a broader investment mix in case there is a pullback.

Unlike S&P 500 index funds, total market funds also provide exposure to small- and mid-cap stocks in addition to large-cap companies.
Alternatively, investors may opt to broaden the exposure an S&P 500 index fund already provides in their portfolio. One example may be a fund that tracks a total market index that excludes S&P 500 index stocks.

That’s mostly all of it. I do want to set and forget it, I have about $27.k into the U.S ETF index and Canadian index split evenly. I’m up pretty good. Now sits at 30.8k. With a good amount of money in there now, this article just worried me. What you guys think, is this still the strategy ? Are they just fear mongering?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1nwls1l,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 21:14:00,Fitness Revolution Investment Thesis,"I'm of the belief that a health revolution is gripping the young population of America and other developing nations, with people becoming far more conscious than generations past of what they put into their bodies as well as what physical exercise they perform. I think this is driven by a few different factors (in no particular order):

1. Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Our fundamental needs, at least in richer countries, are met for the most part. However, there is a crisis of purpose for many. Fitness can help fill that void.

2. The proliferation of Social Media. We've become inundated with photos and videos of what ""perfect"" bodies should look like. This has fostered a desire in people to try and achieve that for themselves.

3. GLP-1 drugs. Adoption of these drugs will rise rapidly in the years to come. With it will come a desire to ramp up exercise, in order to justify both the results that people are getting from these drugs and their high cost.

4. Protein centric marketing. Starbucks just added protein infused coffee to their menu. ""Protein"" really is the marketing buzzword of the day. 

Although I primarily have publicly traded stocks in mind, could you provide me a few tickers (ETFs are great as well) that I can invest in which are **best poised to capitalize on this revolution**?

You always hear ""supply and demand"". And sure, that kinda makes sense. But I still don't really understand it. Who decides that the right price at this moment right now is X amount of dollars, based on those factors?

For example the real estate market is also driven by supply and demand. Still I can buy or sell a house at any imaginable price, if I find a buyer/seller. And chances are high the house won't go for the exact ""market value"". This is also possible with less unique items like cars, jewelry or electronics (or really anything). There may be an average price for bananas. But still every store won't be the same.

How is the price determined? I'd guess it's some algorithm.
But even then, why can't I sell my stock at half the market price if I feel like it (I can make an order to sell once it reaches that point.

Tesla just reported a massive milestone: **497,099 vehicles delivered in Q3**. That’s not just growth  it’s a record that shows how strong demand still is. Yet the stock dropped about –4% in the session, which makes me think the market is reacting more to sentiment and macro noise than to the fundamentals. Tesla remains polarizing: some call it the future of EVs, others still see a bubble.

But **NVIDIA** feels different. The stock popped **+3 to 4%** on news it will resume AI chip sales to China after the U.S. eased restrictions. That’s huge. Add to that the steady wave of institutional inflows, and it’s clear that big money is doubling down on AI. The narrative is powerful, the fundamentals are strong, and global demand is only accelerating.

As a trader, I see two clear paths:

* **Play Tesla short term**, with leverage for example through RWA Index Perpetual Futures  which let you trade tokenized stocks. I think platforms like Bitget offer that now.
* Or lean into NVIDIA long term, riding the unstoppable momentum around AI.

Personally, I’m much more aligned with the second scenario. But the real question is for you:

How I lost big by ignoring basic advice.,"I just wanted to share a couple of tough lessons I learned so hopefully, some of the new folks here can avoid making the same mistakes. I got burned twice by ignoring the most basic advice, and I hope this helps someone.

1. Don't put everything into one stock. When I first started in 2022, I put my entire savings into a single stock. It went bankrupt, and I lost everything. Diversifying your portfolio is a cliché for a reason.

2. Don't trade based on emotions. More recently, I sold a position because I knew it was overvalued. When it gained another 15%, I panicked with a serious case of fear of missing out and jumped back in. Two weeks later, the stock dropped by 50%. Trust your analysis, not your feelings.

William Blair’s Jed Dorsheimer now projects 480,000 vehicles, up from 437,000 and well above Wall Street’s 443,000 consensus. The increase is tied to strong U.S. demand, a rebound in China, and a pull-forward of buyers ahead of expiring EV tax credits.  
  
At the same time, Elon Musk purchased $1 billion worth of Tesla stock and the company announced an expansion of its Robotaxi program. These developments have fueled renewed bullish sentiment around the stock.  
  
That said, not everything points up. Analysts caution that Q4 margins may face pressure as delivery growth slows and revenue from regulatory credits declines. Tesla also trades at a steep valuation, around 118× projected 2026 EBITDA, compared to the 20–25× range of most tech peers. Risks remain in the form of strong Chinese EV competition, Tesla’s reliance on China, and the “key-man risk” linked to Musk.  
  
Across Wall Street, Tesla holds a consensus “Hold” rating, with 15 Buys, 12 Holds, and 8 Sells, and an average target of $346.57 (around 22% downside from current levels).  
  
Position disclosure: I currently hold a TSLA futures position on Bitget. I took the trade after Musk’s share purchase and the Robotaxi expansion news, and it has been profitable so far.

* Miserable gross revenue: 43m in 2024, 20m in Q2 2025
* The dilution is going crazy: Q1 2025 - 25m shares printed. Q2 2025 - 49m (almost $3billion from market cap in one quater) 

What I see in CEO actions:

* Appointed as CEO in 2025
* In Q1-Q2 of 2025 was awarded almost the same amount of $$$ in shares as the whole gross revenue of IONQ in 2024
* The dude goes public and says: “We are the next Nvidia”, “We will make billions in the future”.  
* Stock makes an insane 600%
* The new CEO sells most of his holdings from before 2025, yet in 2025, he gets a massive amount of new shares

What I think:

It is true, he did not sell any of his CEO stock. In fact, in 2025, while being CEO, he got more than a million new shares. I guess that he will get even more in 2025-2026. In this way, his number of shares and stake would remain the same as before 2025, but he managed to print more than 100 million $ in cash on quantum hype. 

This is more than the projected revenue of IONQ for 2025, which is between $82 million and $100 million (and remember, net is still negative) 

Quite a good deal.

1nvw7lt,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 02:23:31,How do you see the whole AI bubble playing out?,"OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. are entrenched in Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, Oracle, Dell, whatever. They are significantly driving up the cloud revenue of these companies, which in turn buy from Nvidia. Investors keep pouring billions into the AI companies, which keep engaging in price wars with each other and spend whatever little they have left on R&D and paying absurdly high salaries in the name of superintelligence.

When, not if,  this bubble bursts and investor funding dries up for the unprofitable companies, what the hell happens? Call me naive but I just don't see a world where chatgpt doesn't exist anymore or one where people use less AI in the future. Even though the LLM companies are not ideal investments, their products are ridiculously good and it is no secret that all the corporations in the world, say in 10 years, will have significantly higher automation than it does today.

My guess is that these big ones (example OpenAI) are almost too big to fail. If there are concerns about liquidity Sundar or Satya or Zuck would probably swoop in to strike a deal with them. Given this assessment and the idea that the world tomorrow would use more AI than it does today, probably a good idea to invest in something like Dell I think, which is currently at a P/OCF of 13 and pouring large amounts into making data centers. In the alternative that some of these big ones fail, I still think there would be someone else to fill the gap and data center companies would stay afloat.

The Cupertino company has moved staff from working on its new, lighter and cheaper Vision Pro to focus on its smart glasses, which would be similar to those offered by Meta Platforms, the report said, citing people close to the issue. Apple engineers are working on at least two types of the smart glasses. One is being crafted to be paired with an iPhone and will lack its own display. This could be revealed as soon as 2026. The other version will contain a display similar to the recently released Meta Ray-Ban Display.

Apple's smart glasses are expected to utilize voice interaction and AI capabilities, the report said. It would also rely on an upgraded Siri, which is projected for a March release at the earliest. They would also feature a much lower price tag than the Vision Pro, which started at $3,499.

Meta released its Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses on Tuesday, Sept. 30. They start at $799 and feature the Meta Neural Band.

For a while now, I've been seeing a lot of people betting on quantum computers. I've noticed small companies whose stocks have gone up 10x in just a few months. Some are hoping to find the next gem that will lead this new world, which could be the next technological revolution.

Personally, I don't really understand this sector. I've been hearing about quantum computers for years, but it's true that the Nvidia wave, a simple graphics card company that became the world's largest market capitalization, to the point where a few thousand euros invested seven years ago would make you a millionaire today, has made people eager to bet on the next revolution.

I've done my own research on quantum computing, and when I listen to experts, it feels like it's still very far off, even though there's some ""experimental"" commercialization starting. These computers still make too many errors and don't meet the expected needs.

But in my research, one company keeps coming up when it comes to significant advancements in the sector: IBM. Yet, when I look at IBM's stock price, it's nowhere near the small-cap companies that have seen their stocks multiply by 10.

Today, I'm wondering if IBM, with its experience, technological advancements, and especially its financial resources, isn't the best-positioned company in this space.

However, I never see IBM mentioned in this sector. Worse, IBM is even excluded from sector-specific ETFs.

1nvg1dy,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 14:19:43,"Reminder - Tesla sales trending down, maybe unprofitable 3Q from no emissions credits, and taxi still has safety drivers - stock UP 30% Lol","The absurdity of Tesla knows no bounds. 

* Publicly available China sales data- which is about 35% of Tesla's sales - is still down 9% year over year, and Europe sales are still falling. American sales expect a bump due to loss of tax credits, but with Elon's alignment with Trump in the US generally hurting American sales, and significantly increased EV competition in the US, that bump is likely to be marginable at best. Accordingly, Tesla EV sales are still virtually guaranteed to be down year over year this quarter, stagnant at best. Remember, in 2020 Elon and Tesla bulls were projecting a ramp up to 20 million car sales per year (traditional EV sales, not robotaxi sales) by 2030. They've been stagnant - now decreasing - at under 2 million car sales for over a year now. 



* Worse still, the revenue from automotive regulatory credits will drop to zero starting this quarter, as emissions penalties were eliminated under the Trump administration. Notably, those emissions credits have accounted for, on average, 50% of Tesla's net income over the past 5 quarters; and, 1Q2025 would have actually had a negative net income of -$186 million without the $595 million in income from selling automotive regulatory credits that quarter. 



* And, while robotaxi is interesting and technologically, looks like it's trending towards feasibly working, Tesla still has safety drivers in the markets its operating in -which is mainly Austin at the moment - despite Musk saying it would reach half the U.S. population by the end of the year.  And, recent autonomous driving disclosures to the NHTSA indicate that in the most recent August month Tesla had 3 accidents for having less than 30 cars on the road, a ratio of 0.3/car/month. Waymo, in contrast had 51 incident reports in August for its 1,500 cars on the road across the country, a ratio 0.03/car/month and a factor of 10 less incidents per car per month than Tesla. And, while Musk has touted that Tesla is the leader in robotaxi for something like 8 years now, not only has Waymo factually rendered more autonomous rides with dramatically more mileage and, at this point, had demonstrated to be a working technology; but more and more competitors are popping up, such as Zoox in the U.S.; and pony.ai, BYD, and Baidu in Asia. Which is to say, competition is coming, and some would say has already come and surpassed Tesla, for the robotaxi space as well. 



* Additionally, if one takes a step back and compares the robotaxi market to the current ride-share market - as that's likely what it will displace since most people that own cars will presumably still want to have their own car - even assuming mature, robust market share and profit margins, the valuation is still probably under $300 range. For example, by my back of the envelope math there were approximately 100 billion ride share miles rendered worldwide in 2024. If you assume Tesla had 50% of that market (which is generally an unheard of market share in a market with decent competitions - Apple, for example, has a 25% global market share); and, assuming that, pursuant to Musk's own projections, the cyber cab was able to get cost per mile down to $0.30/mile, and they charged a reasonable $1/mile to riders, and that does not go lower with more competition; that would give 100 billion miles \* 0.5 market share \* $0.70 profit per mile = $35 billion profit off of robotaxis per year. $35 billion/3.4 billion shares = $10.29 per share and giving that a P/E of 30 gives you $308 target price. In other words, in a mature industry where Tesla robotaxi's had global reach and 50% market share, and profit margins of 70% per mile, the high price is still only $300 a share. 

**Tesla is up 30% this month to $450 a share as of today**, and likely trending towards a P/E of over 300 as it's EV sales profits are likely trending towards a range of $1 to $2. **Gotta love the American stock market!**",394,296,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nvg1dy/reminder_tesla_sales_trending_down_maybe/,new,Company Discussion,0.88

The brand is called Amazon Grocery and includes more than 1,000 items, ranging from dairy, fresh produce, meat and seafood to snacks and baking essentials, the company said in a release. Amazon said the new offering unites its Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh brands under one label.

“During a time when consumers are particularly price-conscious, Amazon Grocery delivers more than 1,000 quality grocery items across all categories that don’t compromise on quality or taste – from fresh food items to crave-worthy snacks and pantry essentials – all at low, competitive prices that help customers stretch their grocery budgets further,” Jason Buechel, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide grocery, said in a statement.

It’s not the first time Amazon has experimented with a budget-friendly grocery brand. It launched a similar offering last September, called Amazon Saver, that was “focused on value.”

The move comes as Amazon’s grocery business has been in flux.

The company has continued to streamline its chain of Go cashierless convenience stores and Fresh supermarkets, announcing last week that it will close all of its locations in the U.K.

At the same time, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and other company executives have touted the success of sales of “everyday essentials” within its online grocery business, which refers to items such as canned goods, paper towels, dish soap and snacks.

The company last month expanded same-day delivery of fresh foods to more pockets of the U.S. as it looks to encourage shoppers to add meat and eggs to their order while they’re browsing its sprawling online store.

Here’s why I think CD388 is closer to 75%.

**Disclosure:** I hold shares of $CDTX. This is not investment advice.

In my original valuation post [CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or am I missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)  I modeled CD388 using a **75% probability of success (PoS)**. Some readers pushed back, saying Phase 3 programs are “coin flips” until final results are out.   That’s often true, but I think CD388, Cidara’s long-acting influenza prophylaxis, is further along than that. This post explains why I believe **75% is a realistic and conservative anchor** for estimating what the company should be worth today:

**1)   The dataset is unusually large and robust**  
Many Phase 2 programs enroll a few hundred patients. CD388’s phase 2b NAVIGATE trial had **over 5,000 participants** and took place across multiple geographies during an exceptionally strong flu season.  At the 450 mg dose, efficacy hit **76% vs placebo (95% CI: 49–90%, p<0.0001)**. That kind of result gives far more confidence than you’d get from smaller, underpowered studies that often precede a Phase 3.

**2)   The mechanism isn’t a leap of faith**  
Plenty of Phase 3 failures come from untested biology. CD388 leverages **zanamivir**, the active in Relenza, which already has 20+ years of human safety/efficacy data. The Fc extension used in CD388 changes the half-life, not the core antiviral mechanism, and Fc fragments have been widely used in other approved biologics without introducing new safety liabilities.

**3)   Safety looks clean so far**  
In NAVIGATE, no dose-dependent safety issues appeared across 150, 300, or 450 mg. Adverse events tracked with placebo.

**4)   FDA has signaled confidence**  
The FDA just recently accepted Phase 2b as **pivotal** and allowed a single Phase 3 to serve for BLA filing (see   [$CDTX: FDA Minutes Confirm Expanded + Accelerated Phase 3 for Cidara’s Flu Prophylaxis CD388](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npc6fd/cdtx_fda_minutes_confirm_expanded_accelerated/)). CD388 already has **Fast Track**, and the company has also applied for **Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)**. If granted, BTD would be a further strong validation, speeding review and signaling FDA’s view that CD388 meets a serious unmet need.

**5)   A exceptionally strong flu season stress-tested the drug**  
The 2024–25 flu season was severe, creating abundant endpoints and ensuring the trial was well-powered (better than expected). That adds confidence that efficacy wasn’t a fluke of low case counts.

**While the strong data and FDA support make it tempting to push the probability of success up a notch, I am anchoring it to 75% to stay \*conservative\*.**   The point isn’t that risk has vanished because clearly it hasn’t.  It’s that CD388’s Phase 3 isn’t the typical binary gamble retail investors assume for an asset at this stage of development.  Assuming 75% probability of success in my valuation model reflects the strength of the data and FDA’s stance without overstating the case.

**TL;DR (again):** Many Phase 3s are a coin toss in terms of probability of success. CD388 has strong data, a validated anti-viral mechanism, Fc fragment safety precedent, clean safety over a large phase 2b trial, and FDA confidence,  which is why I am sticking to a 75% probability of success in my valuation model.

I’ll be following up with a separate post to update my **valuation analysis** now that FDA minutes have confirmed the Phase 3 plan and expanded TAM to include all adults over 65.",5,6,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nv985m/cidara_cdtx_why_75_probability_of_success_for/,new,Company Analysis,0.65

> AI is changing fast, and so are its information sources. ChatGPT may be pulling back from Reddit, once a goldmine for conversational training data. If true, this marks a turning point where verified information beats crowdsourced content. A recent observation from Andrea Bosoni caught attention: ChatGPT seems to be ditching Reddit answers. OpenAI apparently figured out that random forum posts aren't always trustworthy. The days of spamming Reddit with fake brand mentions to manipulate AI responses? Pretty much over.

> Reddit was valuable for years because of its massive range of discussions and natural conversational style that helped train AI dialogue. But it came with baggage - misinformation, low-quality threads, and people actively trying to game the system. This move signals something bigger across the AI industry: the push for trusted, verifiable data sources. Better accuracy, less misinformation, and harder to manipulate - that's the goal.

>The tradeoff is real. You'll probably get more consistent, fact-based answers. But that quirky, community-driven personality Reddit brought to responses? That might be fading. For the AI world, it's a clear message: transparency and trust in training data aren't optional anymore. ChatGPT's Reddit pullback shows where AI is headed - credibility over chaos. Fewer wild responses, more reliability.

Companies shed a seasonally adjusted 32,000 jobs during the month, the biggest slide since March 2023, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 45,000.

In addition to the drop in September, the August payrolls number was revised to a loss of 3,000 from an initially reported increase of 54,000.

Due to the government shutdown, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will not be releasing their job report this Friday, unless the shutdown is resolved by then. 

Job losses spread across sectors during September, offset by a 33,000 increase in education and health services as schools reopened and health care continued its long streak of hiring.Elsewhere, leisure and hospitality, a key sector for consumer demand, saw a loss of 19,000 as vacation season wound down. The other services category posted a drop of 16,000, while professional and business services was off 13,000, trade, transportation and utilities declined by 7,000 and construction lost 5,000.

On a broad scale, service providers decreased 28,000 and goods producers shed 3,000.

1nuzqe0,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 01:18:58,PATH to Orchestration,"This morning, ahead of their Fusion conference in Las Vegas, UiPath released some massive press releases. The common theme across all of them - UiPath is partnering with the biggest tech companies to ensure that UiPath's workflow orchestration system, called Maestro, is at the top of its game and able to connect with the best agents and data tools.

They announced partnerships with Snowflake so that Snowflake's Cortex AI agent can integrate into Maestro. This is crucial as many of UiPath's customers have their data stored in Snowflake and will be leveraging their agents for data insights. They also announced huge partnerships with Google Gemini, OpenAI, and NVIDIA. I encourage you to read the press releases for yourself. 

Why is this so important? UiPath is not trying to create every AI agent from scratch - instead, they are building the platform that orchestrates all of the agents and robots at the top...like a Maestro does with a full string orchestra. This will allow UiPath to stay extremely nimble and allow their customers to have access to the best agents in the world - some of which will be built by other companies (CortexAI, NVIDIA) and others that will be in-house (UiPath's PeakAI).

I'm not suprised by these announcements - in my prior post with some detailed DD on PATH, I mentioned that they were already partnered with LangChain and Microsoft Copilot to break down any concerns of developing walled gardens. It's still early days in UiPath's second act; however, the path there is clear. If you are a believer that corporations will be building agentic automation into their workforce at scale, then you are bullish PATH. The company is carving out its spot as the agnostic platform (a.k.a. the Switzerland of automation) that will span across their customers' entire enterprises.",0,0,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuzqe0/path_to_orchestration/,new,Company News,0.5

I just demoralized one of their Mediterranean bowls the other day, and when I was inside, some girl said, ""Why can't they open one up in Parksville?"" I almost said, don't worry shawty, eventually they will.

CAVA has just reached its 52-week low and touched 25 on the RSI yesterday. Its 52-week spread is honestly incredible, 172 high, 58 low, and I feel for those who bought in the triple digits. But I'm not done believing. And I'm CERTAINLY not fading them because of a 50x multiple. Can you guess Chipotle's multiple over the last decade? It is 77x. Over the last seven years, Chipotle grew EPS roughly 40% CAGR (excluding COVID). Chipper was really always trading at a premium.

Now, I'm not sitting here comparing them to Chipotle, just looking at an industry peer. But I want to put into perspective just how small CAVA is, and just how enticing this 2032 1,000-restaurant goal is. They currently only have 400 locations across the U.S. In 2007, one year after Chipper's IPO, they had \~700. Five years later, they doubled their store count, and in those five years, more than doubled their operating margin. In fact, Chipper's operating margin in 2007 was 7.5%, similar to CAVA's 7.38% last quarter. Rapid expansion in the QSR industry pushes margins, and like Ackman said, you can't go wrong owning a growing food chain.

I'm still bullish on CAVA, and yes, I own the shit out of it. I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts.

1nushl2,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 19:20:49,How to manage a good quality startup stock?,"*EDIT: Clearly the word startup is causing confusion :) By startup, I am referring to a company that is in early stages, yet to prove / have a stable 'product' (but has proven its steps to get there), is growing fast, learning fast. This company is pre-revenue, publicly traded.*

I'll leave out the stock name to avoid clouding judgement and personal preferences over industry, company, etc. Keen to get your general thoughts on this stock managing question.

Essentially, there is a technology company (with hardware+software products) that's another couple of years away from properly generating revenue. It is a leader in its space, very innovative, very well-connected with traditional industry leaders, has great leadership with great technical background. They play it safe, do not boast. All in all, I feel quite confident in their direction and ability to navigate issues as they hit them. But - They've only hit limited milestones yet (limited compared to final target, but well on-schedule and not technologically limited by any stretch of imagination) and may hit various issues like any startup. Of course, they have good competitors too, though it is not crowded at the moment.

The stock tends to go up and down quite a bit, but I feel there is decent investor confidence.

The big questions are:

\- How much % of your portfolio would you invest in such a stock?  
\- Would you hold it forever? (or at least till it starts generating revenue and profits)  
\- Or would you try to do a bit of swing trading to time the up-downs? This could be even on a part of your holding, but of course there is no guarantee you will time it properly and very like you will get it wrong! But equally, it feels a shame to be holding on to say, 9-10% gain YTD when the stock's gone up and down 30-40%. Of course, like any good startup, as it starts generating revenue and stabilizes as a company, I wouldn't be surprised to see a 3x or more jump in share price...",0,32,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nushl2/how_to_manage_a_good_quality_startup_stock/,new,Unknown,0.38

Edit: if you ever wanted to know when to buy a stock or sell, just look to see if the comments are greedy or fearful.
Sentiment changes fast from my post not too long ago where I was also mocked for saying 230 in an AI bubble is unrealistic 

Recently I made a bold post,I claimed Nvidia would hit 230 by year end….

It’s possible but after today I’m disgusted by the price manipulation.

112,000,000 combined volume before a random thrust up? 

112,000,000/171,000,000 came from two huge bursts of volume. 

This changed my outlook and perception on Nvidia to the downside. If the company is mismanaging and manipulating the stock price to this degree I can’t say I want any part of this.

I looked into the so deal… OpenAI only generates 12B in revenue yet received 100billion? This just seems insane considering OpenAI burned 8billion this year and they’re not profitable but competing against google,tesla,meta that are very profitable especially in free cash flow. At least pets.com didn’t lose insane amounts of money each year.

So Nvidia, why did you invest 100billion in them? Where did these 112,000,000 volumes come from. Now that some random company with 224billion suddenly bought….super interesting 

I’m out of this stock, it’s too risky if it
‘s the case they need outside deals from ‘investors’ to keep a stock moving the way they’d like it to move 

Nvidia is the Enron of today and if you know that history it’s not good. 

One single miss on earnings in this stock that’s priced for perfection is insanely risky 

We usually also get 2 pullbacks in a year, I wonder what the excuse to rug pull will be from wall street

There is already a huge rise in unemployment of college grads compared to past 30 years trend.

I see everyone saying that AI may be a bubble or not a bubble but nobody is talking about what if populist politicians all over the world get in the way and make laws to limit the use of AI when they are reducing headcount.

Having said that, I am scratching my head on how can they even make a law restricting the running of a private company, seems like impossible to do it, isn't it?

Only thing that comes to my mind is: They can make a law to raise taxes on companies if they have increasing profit but reducing headcount. Sounds like a very bad idea since it goes against the very fabric of increasing output via efficiency.

On second thought I think this risk is very low since AI companies will also lobby against it, not to mention it is anti free market capitalism and reeks of a command economy like some communist countries.

The pair, who are also currently copresidents, will transition into their new jobs on Jan. 1 and will report to Ek.

1nuhymn,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 12:32:23,Pfizer Gets Three-Year Grace Period From Trump Pharma Tariffs,"Bloomberg) -- Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said the company secured a three-year grace period from President Donald Trump’s promised tariffs on pharmaceuticals in a deal that would lower some of its US drug prices.

The company will sell some products at a 50% average discount on a direct-to-consumer website called TrumpRx, an initiative intended to allow Americans to pay cash for drugs at discounted rates negotiated by the government.

The deal appears to resolve two major threats facing Pfizer, as it would stave off more damaging drug pricing policies while shielding the company from future tariffs imposed by the administration’s Section 232 investigation into whether the cost of medicine represents a national security threat. 

It’s the latest example of the transactional nature of winning tariff exemptions from Trump, who has unilaterally wielded trade policy to exert power over multiple industries. As recently as last week, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on the industry. 

As part of its deal, Pfizer will offer across-the-board reductions on US prices for Americans enrolled in the Medicaid insurance program, giving them “most favored nation” pricing on some of its medicines, Trump said. He has repeatedly pressured companies to bring their US prices in line with what foreign countries pay for medicines.

“The United States is done subsidizing the health care of the rest of the world,” Trump said.

Bourla also announced a $70 billion push on research and development and domestic manufacturing over the next few years. The company was one of the rare exceptions among major drugmakers who rushed to highlight the return of manufacturing facilities to the US amid pressure from Trump.

“We now have the certainty and stability we need on two critical fronts, tariffs and pricing, that have suppressed the industry’s valuations to historic lows,” Bourla said in a statement.",424,144,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuhymn/pfizer_gets_threeyear_grace_period_from_trump/,new,Company News,0.96

One common argument on here is that Google's business model is not threatened by OpenAI, because the highest value searches (shopping related ones) are still done through Google, whereas OpenAI is capturing lower value queries.  So while people turn to LLMs for general questions, they still use Google for online shopping and click on sponsored ads. 

Most importantly, online retailers looking to advertise to people that are directly searching for their type of product really only had Google/Yahoo/Bing as an option, and Google had the majority of market share.

Today OpenAI killed this theory. OpenAI is in the process of integrating shopping directly into ChatGPT. It is still in its early stages, right now only supporting Etsy, and will soon rollout to Shopify. These platforms pay OpenAI for driving sales. 

CPC and CPM for Google ads are notoriously expensive, so if this goes well, expect more online retailers to implement deals with OpenAI, and cut Google ad spend as OpenAI drivers higher return on investment and such announcements boost share price. 

This is a much safer form of performance based advertising. Paying per click on Google ads is risky, because a click doesn't guarantee a sale. If OpenAI is charging a fee based on the final sale rather than per click, this makes marketing ROI much easier to predict.",262,130,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntsp96/openai_launching_instant_checkout_working_with/,new,Company News,0.8

Avengrid was acquired by Iberdrola and taken private, and Avengrid shareholders were paid $35.75 per share in 2024.

My question is this… I spoke with a shareholder customer service rep who told me as there had been no activity, the money was turned over to the State of Florida. However, Florida is showing that those 200 shares are only worth $270.00. Is there a reason for this difference?

In both sides, Commodities will surge, and debt becomes less of an issue. Right now, KOS has a lot of debt, but a weakening currency works in its favor. If A.I. and AGI actually come through, energy will become the new gold like more than actual gold. And yes, eventually renewables like solar will take over, but if you look at what these data centers are and will run on, it’s mostly traditional power.

While the department’s scope covers a multitude of areas, the impact on data releases will be pressing for investors.

1ntm28y,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 12:05:17,WeRide (WRD) - Bet on Robotaxis - DD,"If you are looking to invest in a pure-play robotaxi/autonomous driving tech stock with blockbuster revenue growth and major global partnerships, you should seriously consider going all in on WRD. The recent quarter’s results and newsflow have been very positive: 

WRD tripled its Abu Dhabi robotaxi fleet, launched Saudi’s first service, secured permits in Dubai, Singapore, Belgium, and even made Fortune’s Change-the-World list. Some key facts:

# Let's see the recent Analyst sentiments:

* Citigroup (Sep 29, 2025): Initiated WRD coverage with a **Buy** rating and $15.50 price target.
* UBS (Aug 4, 2025): Initiated coverage with a **Buy** and $12.00 target.
* JPM: Initiated coverage orginally at \~$23 earlier this year but move it down to about 13 (still 30% upside from today
* s price)
* Consensus: Average 12-month price target \~$16.32, implying \~88% upside over current levels.

# Recent Earnings & Growth (Q2 2025)

* Revenue: RMB127.2M (US$17.8M) in Q2’25, **+60.8% YoY**.
* Robotaxi revenue: RMB45.9M (US$6.4M), **+837% YoY**, now **36.1% of total revenue**.
* Gross Profit: RMB35.7M (US$5.0M), **+40.6% YoY**, with gross margin **28.1%**.
* R&D/OpEx: Rapidly expanding (Q2 op-exp +42.5% to RMB487.8M) as WeRide scales globally.
* Net loss: RMB406.4M; management views spend as investment in future profitability.
* CEO/CFO: Emphasized robotaxi growth is now *core* to revenues; operations scaling globally is “at an inflection point” toward profitability.

# Robotaxi & AV Partnerships (Tech Exposure)

WeRide’s whole thesis is scaling Level-4 autonomous taxis/shuttles worldwide, with major partnerships and pilots on 4 continents:

* **Middle East (Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Dubai)**: Largest public AV fleets outside the US/China. Tripled Abu Dhabi fleet, first Saudi L4 taxi permit, rides linked with Uber. Middle East fleet aims for 1,000 vehicles by 2030.
* **China (Shanghai)**: Launched L4 robotaxis with Chery Group and Jinjiang taxi firm; co-developed new EV “CER” model.
* **Southeast Asia (Singapore)**: Grab invested in WeRide; first fully driverless robotaxi service planned with thousands of AVs in SEA.
* **Europe (France, Belgium)**: Partnered with Renault for L4 robo-shuttles, pilot programs in Belgium and France.
* **Tech**: HPC 3.0 computing unit cuts AV compute cost \~50%, giving WeRide an edge.
* **Permits**: Holds L4 AV licenses in 7 markets (China, UAE, Singapore, France, Saudi, Belgium, US), more than any peer.

# Key Metrics & Valuation

* Market Cap: \~$2.9B.
* FY2024 Revenue: \~$50.2M; 2Q’25 alone $17.8M.
* Ownership: Founders hold \~4.8% each; corporate backers include SoftBank/Alliance Ventures and Zhengzhou Yutong. Top 25 holders own \~44%.
* Profitability: Unprofitable (2Q’25 net loss \~RMB406M), EPS deeply negative. Cash burn focused on R&D and expansion.
* Guidance: Ambition to scale to “thousands” of robo-vehicles by 2026.
* Analyst Outlook: Average 12-month price target \~$16.3, reflecting strong confidence in growth.

# Recent News & Catalysts

* **Belgium L4 Permit**: First-ever Belgian Level-4 test license for EZ10 Robobus in Leuven.
* **Dubai License**: Robotaxi trial permit; initial 50 GXR robotaxis, scaling to \~1,000 vehicles.
* **Grab Investment**: Strategic equity investment; L4 robotaxis to deploy across Southeast Asia.
* **Index & PR Wins**: Added to Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index; featured on Fortune’s 2025 Change the World list.
* **Saudi Launch**: First public robotaxi pilot in Riyadh with Uber.

**What to watch next:**

* Revenue growth in Robotaxi business.
* New regulatory permits
* Partnerships with the big guys (Uber, NVDA)
* Buybacks

**Bottom line:** While there are valuation concerns due to high multiples, WeRide is unprofitable **but** growing explosively. The Q2 beat, positive analyst coverage, and pipeline of high-profile deployments make a bullish thesis. With a \~$2.9B market cap and small revenue base, the unique global footprint – 30+ cities, dozens of AV permits, and strong industry backing, I see massive growth potential. Catalysts like EU/ME rollouts, index inclusion, and continued robotaxi scaling could drive the stock if execution stays on track.",15,2,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm28y/weride_wrd_bet_on_robotaxis_dd/,new,Unknown,0.8
1ntjtyt,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 10:41:29,Don't be afraid to miss the opportunity. You can't!,"We're in a situation where the stock market is inflated with worthless companies valued in billions - all because people want to buy the next Apple, Nvidia, or Google. Here's my point: you can't miss the next big thing. Successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Their success is a story that lasts for decades. Look:

In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey.

In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with their products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. Think it was late? In 2010, the stock was priced at less than $10.

In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was definitely too late? Ha!

See the pattern? Those stories show that a great business provides a window of buying opportunity measured in years, if not decades. Look at the greatest businesses and see how this pattern holds. FOMO is a lie! You have plenty of time to do your research and enter.

What I'm showing is how great businesses are picked: they change the world with their innovation. No need for empty words and marketing campaigns when you can witness the impact yourself, without a middleman.

A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research, take your time. Even after five years, we'll remain a great opportunity."" A scam business sells you an beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist.

Remember, 99% of start-ups fail even if at some point their stock price rise 10x in short amount of time. That means if you don't do your research and all you read is headlines and biased statements made by insiders, you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Eloquent words != an eloquent business model. Short term gain != long term success.  

Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products (some don't even have products), all because management is big on words, selling ""we are the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action. 

AI, Quantum, Energy, EV... there is always a next big thing screaming from all the corners ""Choose me!"". Before buying, ask this: ""Are you a great businesses? Have you demonstrated your excellence multiple times over the years? Can I witness the impact you make without a middleman's words?"" 

FOMO takes away your ability to analyse and think; it gaslights you with terms such as ""FUD"". A good investment withstands criticism and doubt. Lies needs to be loud because they're lies. Truth is truth no matter what - it doesn't care to shout.",0,17,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntjtyt/dont_be_afraid_to_miss_the_opportunity_you_cant/,new,Unknown,0.23

The company would continue supplying parts, but what happens in the medium to long term with retailers when a major supplier falls down?   I assume that costs can go up as they seek wider sources of supply for their privately branded parts.   Any hiccup in metrics for these high valuation companies could at least be a set-back to their stock prices.

O'Reilly, for example trades at a steep PE multiple (38x last year's earnings) and achieved a $90 billion market cap last week (more than Target and Best Buy combined, and much more than either Ford or GM).   

Over time, these retailers have been borrowing ever larger amounts of money to buy back their shares, boosting their earnings per share figures.   Yet, their operating income (up 18%) is only growing at the rate of CPI inflation (15% since 2021), despite adding many new store outlets.   On average, O'Reilly has grown operating income per store only about 3% over four years which is way below inflation.  

I am betting those PE multiples will come down.   Even going from 38 down to 30 would be near-term hit to stock price.

1nso3q8,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 09:17:00,Wash Sales are Confusing,"Wash sales are a conundrum.
Wash sales are an oxymoron.
Wash sales are a black hole.
Wash sales are damnable. 

Let me explain. I’m considered the pattern day trader by my broker, interactive brokers. I am not one of those day traders that has five screens constantly trading five stocks at a time. I am a day trader that quite often just trade off my cell phone and I usually concentrate on one stock. Most recently it has been NVDA. I can assure you I’m not getting rich, there is no yacht in my future. I have no problem selling the stock for a total of five dollars profit. My goal is not to get rich,  just to give me something to do since I’ve retired. I recently ran across something that I have never seen nor did I know it was occurring. And that is an aspect of wash sales that I did not know was happening. Believe me when I tell you I understand wash sales since Scott trade shut down my trading for three days one time.

I have recently started trading a new stock and in seven days and over 50 trades I only had one loss- that  of a single  dollar. I have made a little  money off this stock. So I was surprised when interactive brokers raised my average price per share on a subsequent purchase  since I have incurred so little losses (a total of -$1 over 50 trades).

For those of you, like me who thought wash sale (or losses) were based on the total trade and not each individual trade you are wrong. It is enlightening. Let’s look at an example. 

The ABC corporation pays a good dividend and the stock price is pretty much range bound at $90 a share. But a rumor has surfaced that the ABC corporation will win a big contract and the share price goes up to $100 a share, you thinking if it’s true it will go higher so you buy one share at $100. Turns out the rumor is false and the share price drops to $80 a share. You knowing it is a $90 share company buy one share at $80. You now hold two shares with an average price of $90 a share. You sell your two shares at $91 per share and pocket two dollars. The price then drops to $70 a share. You realize this is just an over reaction to the loss of a potential contract and you buy one share at $70. But interactive brokers will reflect your average price per that one share at not $70 but at $79.  Because what I didn’t know was when I sold it at $91, I incurred a wash sale from where I purchased it from $100 and sold it at $91. I always thought the wash sale was based on the total sale and not each individual purchase. So when I sell my one share at $90 that I purchased at $70 interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11 ($90-$79). But this is a mirage.  It is an illusion. If you go check your realized gains interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11. YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN WILL ALSO REFLECT A PROFIT OF $11. This is for tax purposes only. If you go look at your cash report, according to interactive brokers, it will reflect a gain of $20. So those of you who are basing their profits off of a realized gain report it is not a true reflection of your actual trading.",0,20,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nso3q8/wash_sales_are_confusing/,new,Industry Discussion,0.44

I'm french and watched some economic/financial tv shows. They are talking more and mora about metals and oil.

Yesterday, a financial analyst says 6 millions ton of cooper will miss in the next years. The main reason is typically the industrial sector need more and more, and the reserve are emptier and emptier. So maybe I wonder it's the best time to invest in a good mine company to enjoy the futur strong demand.

About gold, they expected the price will keep on rising strongly because the weakess of dollars and the currency policy of asian country (like the new habits of people) will push the demand. I've just sold Genesis Minerals, that looks a beautiful gold mines, but I needed some cash for another investment. Today, it's tricky to find a good point because too much vol.

Oil : It's tricky. One of them said it's a big time to invest in oil. The reserves look weak, and big oil companies tries to find more and more new reserve. But, the main of analyst said it's not a good move because today, every actor (included investment sector) bet on green energy and are not convinced oil will get a good bet on the next 5 years.

So i would like to get your opinion and if you got some stock to advise, you're welcome :)

Do you think the UNP/NSC merger will be value accretive, or are you worried about the price (as a UNP shareholder) and the additional debt of the combined entity?

Railroads have been by far my worse performing investment. I predicted more industrial integration between US, Canada and Mexico and an increase in trade, but boy was I wrong. In addition, I think the economic landscape is shifting to less higher quality products and software, so the volume of goods transported might increase at a slower pace than it has in the last decade (think cars sales for example). Also Business to consumer has lower margins and higher costs.

Still railroads have their infrastructure in place, are clearly cashflow positive, and pay a small dividend every year and buy back a few shares every quarter, so I don’t think they will lose lots of money long term.

Honestly, I am not a fan of NCS reliance on coal (although this administration doesn’t hate the product), and I am a bit concerned of the additional debt taken over by UNP, as well as the 27% share dilution.

However, the management is unlikely to bankrupt such a profitable company, and I can only see advantages owning such a big chunk of US commercial rail long term, at least for shareholders with a massive time horizon.

Excitement over their rare earth potential is driving high interest in their stock, but mainly class A, $METC. Recent analyst forecasts for METC are $42 and $45. So, there's good potential for return beyond the current price of $31.

But here's the intriguing thing, class B stock is the tracking stock for the rare earth minerals. It will get 20% of the income generated by the rare earths, plus a coal fee per ton and royalty fees. There is currently 
10.84 million shares B extent and 55.18 million shares class A, putting class B at 16.4% of the total. So it certainly seems the better of the two, but class B ($METCB). is currently trading at a 50% discount to class B. 

I own some class B shares and so far, every time I compare dividends with class A, it's been better. Class B should never be worth more than A because the company has the right to convert them back to class A. But class B has the same asset claims as class A. 

This continues to amaze me and I keep coming back to see if there's anything I'm missing, so would really appreciate any insights you might have.

1nr23ui,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 09:59:44,"More Losses, More Liquidity: Who Really Wins Without PDT.","This legislation is just going to be a liquidity injection, more money for the brokers, more money for the Institutions and Market Makers. **Less for Retail.**

It’s a short term illusion of benefit to small players which always benefits institutions; a very common pattern in legislation. It’s never for you.  
Trading influencers will also love it.  
I’m not being cynical, I’m telling you how it is. Lobbyists influence the call.

Undercapitalised new traders will have a more accessible avenue to lose money. All this is, is a smoke screen to further enrich institutions. This post adresses key nuances in the arguement for and against PDT’s removal.

# Here’s my main point:

A lot of new retail traders avoid options because of the perceived complexity; a lot avoid futures because they don’t understand those derivatives either, and a lot have avoided day trading stocks because of the PDT rule. If these same people can’t find a solution to counter it before the legislation, they likely won’t put in the required work to have sustained profitability.

The same type of people who won’t put in the required work will be able to proceed with margin trading stocks when they shouldn’t. The newcomers, tryouts (both old and new) and the social-media influenced.

**The point is this legislation will have a net negative outcome for retail. If you combine (all net trader P&L)/NumberOfTraders it’ll be negative. Influencers and institutions will benefit. Not retail.**

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/kcs82kp7lirf1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=c91d791d95838ed0c5f53d63cdb09b3011823e85)

# Addressing Surface-Level Nuances

A trader had said,  
“People, like myself, could do small account challenges with only a few thousand and not be limited to PDT.”

This is very much like gambling with a bankroll in a less complex market.  
Margin trading stocks instead of options (which didn’t have a PDT rule).

This trader had also said,  
“There are tons of people in my circle who trade with both a full time job, family, and school. That has absolutely nothing to do with it. They trade just as successfully as others.”

For those thinking similarly, don’t let survivorship bias cloud your judgement. Profitability is different from sustained profitability. For now they are. **Check Figure 1.**

# Nuance 1: The Main Narrative 

“What you're not seeing, which is obvious is that by removing PDT rule, traders under 25,000 are no longer pressured to get a win on each trade.”

I get your point and understand it fully, but this is a deterrent to not margin trade stocks if a trader is undercapitalised. This stops people from margin trading stocks (trading with leverage). They can do whatever they want on a cash account with or without PDT; it’s a smoke screen so the decision can be justified to sceptics.

# Nuance 2: PDT doesn’t save people from giving their money to the market.

Here’s an example: Cigarettes are harmful but we should allow people to smoke, sure. But should we make it more accessible? Does it benefit the smoker or the tabacco industry more? Tabacco.

It’s like that with removal of PDT people will still trade, it just accelerates the losses and inflates undercapitalised retail participation.

**Margin trading is a choice, and PDT only restricts margin accounts.**

The point is this legislation will have a net negative outcome for retail. If you combine (all net trader P&L)/NumberOfTraders, it’ll be negative. Influencers and institutions will benefit. Not retail.

# Nuance 3: Should people who don’t have 25k to avoid PDT not trade?

That’s not what I said. If anything, I suggested that people who don’t have the time to trade consistently or aren’t rigorous enough with their trading are more likely to lose money.

I do this for a living and know what it takes. It’s not about capital; it’s about knowledge, effort and experience.

A lot of new retail traders avoid options because of the perceived complexity; a lot avoid futures because they don’t understand those derivatives either, and a lot have avoided day trading stocks because of the PDT rule. If these same people can’t find a solution to counter it before the legislation, they likely won’t put in the required work to have sustained profitability.

The same type of people who won’t put in the required work will be able to proceed with margin trading stocks when they shouldn’t. The newcomers, tryouts (both old and new), and the social-media-influenced.

# Nuance 4: most traders lose money so it's better to lose 2000 than lose 25000

If a Retail trader’s balance drops below 25000, the PDT rule kicks in.

**Nuance 4.1: Removal of PDT will be great and remove barriers to entry on the same playing field. PDT Removal will be the best thing to happen in retail stocks**

The points and statistics I’ve cited still apply; it’s financially better for market makers, institutions and brokers but not for retail traders

It’s an overwhelming net negative for the retail investor's pocket. whilst enriching institutions.

**Nuance 4.2: many new traders will have opportunities to grow in ways that wasn’t possible under the old rule**

Few out of many; for most (over 85%), it will be another opportunity to lose money quickly in a more accessible way.

It’s an illusion of freedom because margin trading stocks is an optional thing, and it’s a credit facility that’s offered to the retail trader to increase their risk.

The PDT rule was a limitation on how they could access the credit facility if undercapitalised; it was not about restricting freedoms.

In the 1920s, people were margin trading stocks whether they were average guy or institutional.

People got liquidated, and suddenly you have the Great Depression as a consequence. You need to understand these measures have effects that can cascade into something brutal for everyone.

**Nuance 4.3: It's 2025, not the 1920s, anymore.**

I get your point, but markets have operated in the same way for hundreds of years: supply and demand. Margin has also existed for hundreds of years. It’s nothing new.

# Nuance 5: AI screeners and other tools became more common. It's easier to identify winning stocks now!

This isn’t true and it’s a short term anecdotes don’t hold weight and trend that will be corrected by market algorithms. You need to realise that over the strategies over the medium term can have the illusion of being profitable.

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/w12ck7smlirf1.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fcbcf9a25a68820909b33f246bd1b9ad4e43176)

# Nuance 6: Far more people agree that this change is better than not changing it

This doesn’t mean it’s in your best interest. It’s marketed that way. There should be no appeal to emotion; this should be a redundant factor.

Everything in markets is mathematics and statistics. I’ve read several research papers and over a dozen books. Look at fund managers, practitioners (prop guys), quants, and portfolio managers; they all take it into account, and every profitable trader I’ve communicated with who can present trading statements to prove it takes them into account.

# Nuance 7: You're looking at the negative; it's true you could accelerate losses just as it is as true as you could accelerate winning.

Most traders lose money; that’s a fact, regardless of the exchange. I’m not looking at just the negative; I acknowledge there’ll be winners too. Just very few. Most that win will lose everything they make and/or more due to human psychology, the sunk cost fallacy and other factors.

**Nuance 7.1 It's 2025; we have access to information unlike any other time period in the history of stock trading.**  
That just makes the market more efficient/random this makes market movements harder to predict and profit

**Nuance 7.2 You can look at statistics, but these statistics are based on the 25,000 PDT Rule.**

Most retail traders, over 85%, lose money (according to ESMA, the most generous value), and over long timescales, \~98% lose money. Removal of PDT will increase the number of people margin trading (trading with leverage), which will increase the number of losses and liquidations.

# Ending / Agenda

For transparency: I don’t trade US equities, and I am a UK-based trader; think of me as playing the devil’s advocate.

**If you don’t trade stocks, why bother debating this?**  
I have experience in trading US equities, but I don’t currently trade them; I trade futures and CFDs.

I posted this because I want traders to understand that these legislative changes are rarely in their best interest.  
**Lobbyists make the call.**

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

My understanding is that Hedged indexes protects from currency fluctuations in my case EUR-USD, but with some extra TER cost, in this example 0.03%

Am i wrong in thinking that the extra 0.03% (i know it is compounded over time) is worth the spent to protect from the currency fluctuations? I am not experienced enough to understand Forex and this is why I prefer to play it a little safer. Am I wrong in thinking that?

Also, the NQSE is 10x smaller (hedged - i know it is newer as well), is that because people prefer to get a riskier ETF (SXRV unhedged) that will generate more profit if the EUR will get weaker than USD?

Is the unhedged like investing in both the stocks themselves and forex while hedged is just the stocks?

With construction underway coast-to-coast, Lumen is moving forward a multi-billion-dollar build with plans to add 34 million new intercity fiber miles by the end of 2028, for a total of 47 million intercity fiber miles. The company has already delivered millions of new fiber miles, network capacity upgrades and high-speed connectivity enhancements in 2025, building the network infrastructure enterprises need to power their AI workloads.

“AI is fueling a surge in network demand like we’ve never seen, and Lumen is building the backbone to meet it,” said Kye Prigg, executive vice president, enterprise operations, Lumen Technologies. ""This isn’t incremental – we plan to more than double the size of our U.S. network. We’re positioning Lumen as the trusted network for AI, ensuring our customers have the network scale, speed, and reliability to confidently innovate and grow without constraints.”

**2025 milestones on the road to 47 million intercity fiber miles****^(1)****:**

* **Deployed New Fiber:** Added more than **2.2 million new intercity fiber miles**(2,500+ route miles) and projected to reach 16.6 million total intercity fiber miles by year end. Lumen is utilizing next-generation fiber optic cable from Corning Incorporated to fit two times more fiber into existing conduit.
* **Constructed Signal Boosters:** Construction efforts underway at **176 In-Line Amplifier (ILA) sites**. ILA shelters built on these sites serve as giant signal boosters along the Lumen network with up to triple the power density compared to traditional ILA shelters and are designed to be updated, renewed, and scaled for the future.

1nqm5g2,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 19:35:41,Tesla’s continuing sales slump in Europe weighs on stock price,"Tesla shares fell more than 4% on Thursday after data out of Europe showed a continuing sales slump for the automaker, despite strong demand for fully electric vehicles in the region. 

Tesla EV registrations in Europe, a proxy for sales, fell by about 23% year-over-year in August, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) on Thursday.

There were 14,831 Tesla EV registrations in Europe last month, down from 19,136 in August 2024. In the first eight months of this year, Tesla EV registrations in Europe declined 32.6%, the ACEA said.

Meanwhile, total EV registrations throughout the region rose by around 26% through August compared to the same period in 2024. By contrast, registrations for petrol and diesel-powered vehicles declined by more than 20% over that stretch.

Still, RBC analysts wrote in a note on Thursday that they expect Tesla’s total deliveries for the third quarter could amount to 456,000, above a FactSet-compiled consensus of 448,000 deliveries and a Visible Alpha consensus of 440,000 deliveries.

The analysts expect a bump for Tesla as consumers rush to buy EVs in the U.S. before a $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of September.

Even with Thursday’s slide, Tesla’s stock has bounced back following a brutal start to the year. It’s now up 5% in 2025 after plunging 36% in the first quarter.

Musk’s political activism in the U.S. and beyond has hurt the Tesla brand and dampened its appeal to many prospective EV buyers.

Earlier this year, Musk endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party, and this month he appeared by video at an anti-immigrant rally in the U.K. that turned violent. The rally was led by activist Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rebuked Musk for “dangerous” comments that he made at the rally, where 26 police officers were injured. Musk told attendees, “violence is coming to you” and “you either fight back or you die.”

To revitalize interest in the brand, Tesla has said an affordable new model is in the works, which could help it fend off increased competition from the likes of Volkswagen, BYD and other EV makers that have been picking up market share.

In 2021 they hit almost **$400** per share and with the lower interest rate environment their fundamentals are drastically improving again!

**Why it’s squeezable**

* **Short interest:** **\~21.1M shares** short = **\~26.3%** of float; **days to cover \~3.2**.
* **Float:** \~**84.1M** shares.
* **Borrow dynamics:** IBKR **CTB \~0.4–0.6%** lately; available shares fluctuating (\~150k–350k seen). If price trends up, borrow can dry up fast.

**Fundamentals massively improving**

* **Q2’25 revenue:** **$257M, +\~102% YoY.**
* **GAAP net income:** **+$5.6M** (vs. loss a year ago).
* **Volume:** loans +\*\*\~159% YoY\*\*, dollar volume **\~$2.8B**.
* Balance sheet and guidance commentary point to continued normalisation of funding.

**Macro tailwind**

* **U.S. Q2 GDP revised to 3.8% annualized**, a solid backdrop for risk assets and consumer credit cyclicals like UPST

**Price targets**

* Street 12 month PTs cluster around **$81 avg** (range **$47–$108**), implying notable upside from here. However, this could go MUCH higher with the interest rate cuts now planned and their improving financials - plus with the squeeze potential.

**Catalysts**

* Next earnings + any funding/partner expansions
* Options OI building into earnings can add fuel too

**Levels I’m watching**

* Break/hold above recent supply zone = go time, invalidation is a decisive close back below the last higher low so watch for this...

**Thesis:** Shorts are crowded into a name that just flipped back to profitable with triple digit revenue growth, right as macro prints strong. If UPST clears resistance with momentum then its going to blow up...

I wasn’t expecting to see these two “old guards” of semiconductors shaking the market at the same time.

For Intel, the rally came from a mix of catalysts lining up. Micron’s strong earnings gave confidence back to the sector, and Intel raised its outlook for 2025. With around 76% market share in x86, they’re better positioned than many thought. Digging deeper, I saw they’re preparing the Panther Lake (18A) launch for late 2025, getting US government and SoftBank support for their AI/foundry ambitions, and placing large orders with ASML for the next-gen High-NA EUV machines. They even announced an AI partnership with Trust Stamp, focusing on biometrics and privacy. No surprise analysts bumped the price target up to $43 with a buy rating.

Marvell, on the other hand, is playing a different card: a massive $5 billion buyback, including a $1B accelerated program with $300M already executed this quarter. Instead of betting on a future product or tech breakthrough, they’re giving back directly to shareholders to boost confidence in the near term.

What struck me is the contrast. Intel is trying to rewrite its future by going all-in on AI and foundry, while Marvell is choosing immediate stability. Two very different visions in the same sector, but both managed to move the market big time at the same moment.

Three-month futures traded above $10,496 per ton ($4.7710 per lb.) on the CME, up 2.74% for the day. In London, copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 2% to $10,172 a ton on the London Metal Exchange, the highest level in more than 15 months.

Freeport’s shares fell as much as 10.4% in New York, while rivals Glencore PLC (+3%), Teck Resources (+5%), and Antofagasta (+7.4%) climbed.

Analysts described it as a “negative near-term development that will likely put Freeport in the penalty box.” However, BMO also highlighted that 60% of Freeport’s copper production comes from North and South America, meaning the company still has strong regional output. At the same time, a potential increase in copper prices stemming from reduced supply could partly offset the impact.",35,2,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nq3oqn/copper_price_spikes_on_freeports_grasberg_force/,new,Unknown,0.91

1nprxr3,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 19:52:44,"Nvidia Stock, poised to surpass 230 by year end","Nvidia stock is very misunderstood. Many have been shorting at 180’s and buying at 170’s. It’s been doing this since July 28th. Consolidating for nearly two months.

Nvidia’s key points 

1. They’re not lying about demand. I haven’t heard anyone comment about China not being relevant to their success…the reason Nvidia isn’t concerned is simply because demand surpasses supply even without China.

2. Nvidia has been talking with intel behind the scenes for about a year confirmed by Jensen. If we read in between the lines it means they’ve likely already sucessfully merged a product with intel. Nvidia should never be underestimated with the resources they have at their disposal. Another market Nvidia will dominate and quickly take shares of.

3. Nvidia is an early investor in many of the upcoming giants of tomorrow like NBIS and CoreWeave. All those gains are net positives for Nvidia and only contribute to continued growth. NBIS for example has the most significant growth rates I’ve ever seen a company produce. 820percent revenue before Microsoft deal? That’s execution.

4. OpenAI isn’t a public company,Nvidia is now getting a slice of the most desired AI  company that’s still operating privately. People don’t understand that now Nvidia will have access to all the data OpenAI has…

I could just go on for paragraphs about all the deals Nvidia is doing, about the acceleration of new products but one thing we forgot to mention is Nvidia Hasn’t Moved in Stock price despite having a forward PE of 31…..while the s@p average is currently 27. Why is that you ask? Because currently the market couldn’t give a sht about value.The needle won’t explode with a stock valued at 4.35trillion like oracle or Crypto. 

Nvidia is an exceptional company that’s constantly preformed,evolved and is without a doubt the centre of AI and even still insane growth potential. 

Stocks spend months in consolidation period Nvidia has definitely been doing that, simply a no brainer buy. 

It’s an Undervalued stock considering it’s crop dusting any other of the mag 7. 

I am an Nvidia Investor and I’ve added more today at 176.20 as I believe we’ll see a big rotation in Nvidia and several other chip stocks, I’ve averaged up from 91 to a current of 120 because I see this as a great opportunity for solid gains.

The moment 185 breaks is the moment I could see this hitting 210.

Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

• **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

• **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

• **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
• AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
• Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
• More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
• New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
• Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
• Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
• Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
• Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
• Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
• Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
• Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
• High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
• Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
• Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
• Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
• Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
• Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
• Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
• Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
• Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",262,114,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/,new,Company Discussion,0.83

> Regulators are moving to dismantle one of the most controversial barriers for active retail traders the $25,000 minimum equity rule for pattern day trading. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority on Tuesday approved amendments that would replace the long-standing threshold, making active day trading more accessible to smaller accounts. The change is pending approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

> The $25,000 minimum equity rule mandates that traders must maintain a minimum account balance of $25,000 in a margin account to execute four or more day trades within a five-business-day period. The rule was put in place in 2001 amid the dot-com bubble and crash as regulators grew worried that small traders were taking excessive risks with volatile internet stocks.

> FINRA is replacing this mandate with an intraday margin rule that applies the existing maintenance margin rules to intraday exposure. In other words, one’s intraday buying power will be based on the margin requirements for the positions they take on during the day, not a fixed equity minimum.

I have been with my advisor for a very long time. More than 20 years. Up until the last few years I was extremely busy, and mentally fully occupied, with a demanding career. I left things to the advisor, although I met with him annually. His approach has been very conservative for an extremely conservative throughout that time, way before retirement was on the horizon, and returns have been muted even though the market has shown a long-term uptrend. In a nutshell, it is his practice not to own any individual stocks in a portfolio, in deference to various bond/money market and mutual fund investments. Think 60/40 scenario. A substantial amount of the portfolio has been devoted to foreign stocks, also held in mutual funds, that for many years were essentially flat or declined to some extent compared to US equities. In the last year or so, those have done much better as we all know. These investments have shifted and been adjusted over the years, but very slowly, and with little responsivity to large changes in market conditions. My question is essentially is this a common approach for financial advisors? Of course, it’s clear that such an approach makes managing client’s accounts much less labor intensive, and if one’s clientele is especially sensitive to volatility, it minimizes that factor and probably calms nerves. So it’s easier for an advisor to approach things this way.

This is an extremely tricky situation. The Fed thinks they can rate-cut their way to lowering unemployment. This is not going to work. Lowering rates simply frees up capital - it doesn't guarantee job creation. There is currently no shortage of capital as evident by the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI infrastructure. Lowering rates will simply free up more cash for these types of long-term AI investments that will end up reducing more human labor than it creates.

Also, as the Fed lowers rates, inflation (compounded by tariffs driving up costs) will go much higher. This puts the Fed in a very uncomfortable economic trend called stagflation. It's the elephant in the room that no one wants to publicly say. We're heading toward stagflation. Risk assets will sell off in the short-term. In the longer-term, there will be winners and losers.

1npf99s,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 11:30:25,"Fermi America IPO, is this Legit?","It seems like this company is well positioned to do what they say they would. They plan to supply the energy for data centers with a nuclear plant in Amarillo, Texas. It was founded by Rick Perry and Toby Neugebauer who both have deep ties to both the Texas government and Texas energy sector; which likely smooth permitting processes/timelines. Work and construction set to begin next year, and first plant operational by 2032.

But there’s three big red flags for me. For one this company is relatively new. The second piece is going back to the fact that this plant would be in Amarillo, Texas. Where are they going to get the water from to cool a nuclear plant, and how the heck would it be affordable if it needs to be piped in from somewhere else? Last piece is cash burn, I’ve read they’ve secured 350M in private funding already; and are hoping to secure another 550M from going public. But I see that nuclear plants can cost anywhere from 6B-9B, so for something that would be completed in 7 years it seems like they would need more cash than they hope to get via IPO to meet that goal. Do they already have contracts lined up that’ll front the construction costs? Or maybe government funding they’re expecting that hasn’t been announced? 

All to say, some numbers aren’t adding up to me here and the company is pretty fresh. If it weren’t for the founders having deep ties to the Texas energy sector I could more definitively say this is an AI hype cash grab than a legitimate push.  

The primary growth prospects before the plant opens is the company hitting construction milestones, potentially receiving government funding, and signing contracts to supply data centers. At that point it seems like you’d sell the news.

Any other thoughts on this? I’d personally need to see answers around where the water comes from and how they expect to get the rest of the cash needed for construction given the aggressive timeline btwn now and the first plant opening.

**2. Single Phase 3 may be sufficient for approval**

* FDA supporting that CD388 could go straight to a **BLA filing off one registrational study** if phase 3 is successful. That cuts **2–3 years** off the approval timeline.

**3. Expanded patient population**

* Originally: high-risk comorbidities + immunocompromised.
* Now: also includes **all adults ≥65**, significantly expanding U.S. eligibility to **100M+ patients**.

**Why this matters**

* FDA support for BLA filing after this phase 3 trial is a huge signal of confidence.
* The accelerated start reduces time-to-revenue.
* Expansion to ≥65 significantly expands the potential TAM.
* Together, these updates shrink the “binary biotech discount” the market is still applying to CD388.

**What’s next?**

The next milestone is a potential BARDA award, with a decision expected by year-end (unclear if that means government fiscal year-end in September or calendar year-end in December).

Cidara has been clear: they are seeking BARDA’s help to onshore and scale manufacturing capacity. That may not mean an immediate stockpiling contract, but it’s still a strategic step. For CD388 to play a role in pandemic preparedness, the U.S. government will want domestic supply secured.

So the way I see it:

* Best case: BARDA supports manufacturing build-out and future stockpiling.
* Baseline case: BARDA helps de-risk manufacturing scale-up, validating CD388 as a preparedness asset.

Either outcome reinforces CD388’s long-term strategic value.

**Bottom line**

Universal flu prophylaxis used to be fiction. With today’s FDA minutes, CD388 is:

* Accelerated
* Expanded
* Supported by the FDA
* And fully funded through Phase 3

The market is still treating CD388 like a long shot. Today’s FDA news makes it clear: this is less and less about ""if"",  and increasingly about ""when.”

In my next post, I’ll do a deeper dive into why CD388’s probability of success is higher than most Phase 3 assets and update my rNPV valuation to reflect this news.

1npbyeg,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 09:20:09,$PATH Toward a Multi-bagger,"I have been building my position in PATH for about a year now and am starting to see a recent surge in interest. After noticing a bunch of ""why PATH?"" posts across various subreddits, I decided to provide my thesis:

* UiPath's flagship legacy product is currently the MARKET LEADER in enterprise Robotic Process Automation (RPA) - automating repetitive, generally clerical tasks for enterprises by leveraging PATH's ""software robots"" which can scrape processes and repeat tasks very efficiently (think of robust ""if this, then that"" rules).
* In October 2024, they announced that they were re-building their software suite to be focused on agentic AI with the goal of becoming the primary agnostic software player that would automate entire workflows at the top layer of the enterprise and allow customers to build across third party applications (i.e., not caging enterprises into the walled gardens of Salesforce, Microsoft, etc.). This is a game-changer, as it would go way beyond the rule-based constraints of RPA - it would leverage generative AI to let the software make decisions across platforms.
* In Spring of 2025, UiPath released their Maestro enterprise orchestration software and began putting together proof-of-concepts for their customers. The feedback has been great as Maestro allows customers to build custom end-to-end workflows that combine UiPath's industry-leading RPA technology with the newly released suite of generative AI capabilities. UiPath has a huge advantage over competition as they are already a trusted provider of software automation for over TEN THOUSAND enterprise customers.
* Their go-to-market strategy is super compelling as they have massive partnerships with Deloitte and SAP to help market their products. They also have strong relationship with other software providers like LangChain and Microsoft to ensure UiPath is staying relevant and connected with top companies in the supply chain.
* From a financial perspective, their balance sheet is INSANELY STRONG. Zero debt and $1.5B of cash/marketable securities on-hand.
* They recently made a strategic acquisition of Peak AI to further their product offering by adding a specialized inventory and pricing management AI agent to their software stack.
* Their CEO and founder Daniel Dines is a GENIUS who owns 10% of the company (massive skin in the game). He had the vision, technical prowess, and leadership skills to essentially invent the enterprise RPA market and dominate it before anyone else - he is now going after the enterprise agentic AI space.
* Share price is currently insanely cheap at 4-5x trailing twelve-month sales. Their revenue has been growing at decent clip of \~10% per year, but that doesn't even include the inevitable growth of their agentic AI products that are just now starting to be marketed and gain traction. The market has been sleeping on UiPath and the growth of their new agentic AI automation software is not priced in at all - the industry is projected to grow at a 40% CAGR between now and the end of the decade. Even in a stock market pullback, I think downside risk is pretty limited given the cheap multiple they're already trading at.
* A weakening labor market (which is where we're headed) is bullish for a company that is selling software that allows companies to automate processes and ""do more with less"". So owning PATH is also a natural hedge against the unemployment rate going up.

For all these reasons, PATH has become the second largest position in my portfolio.

Literally any investing related sub will tell you that. The most common advice is “time in the market beats timing the market,” and that if you buy quality companies or broad index funds and just hold for decades, you’ll come out ahead.

But then I see so many people actively trading stocks. Sometimes daily, sometimes weekly, trying to time short term moves. From the outside, it feels like that goes against the idea of long-term compounding, especially when you factor in taxes and trading costs.

So what exactly is the appeal of trading over long-term investing? Do traders believe they can consistently beat the market? Is it more about short-term cash flow rather than long-term wealth building? The excitement that comes with it?

> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday noted that asset prices, a category that typically includes stocks and other risk instruments, are at elevated levels. During a speech in Providence, Rhode Island, the central bank leader was asked how much emphasis he and his colleagues place on market prices and whether they have a higher tolerance for higher values.

> “We do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we’re trying to achieve,” Powell said. “But you’re right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued.” In the run-up to last week’s policy meetings, stocks and other assets rallied strongly as conviction grew that that the Federal Open Market Committee would be lowering its benchmark overnight borrowing rate. Stocks have continued to climb, setting a succession of record highs for major averages, since the decision Wednesday to cut by a quarter percentage point.

> “Markets listen to us and follow and they make an estimation of where they think rates are going. And so they’ll price things in,” Powell said in part of the conversation dealing with mortgage rates.

That combination makes AMSC one of the cleaner mid-cap growth plays I’ve seen recently but there’s very little discussion around this company compared to other energy-adjacent players.

American Superconductor (AMSC) is a ~40 year old systems company for megawatt-scale grid resilience, data centers, wind controls and naval ship protection (high-power electronics, STATCOMs/D-VAR, high-temp superconducting wire which is basically super efficient power transmission, ship protection systems). The company recently added NWL, which brings recurring industrial and defense power sales. They seem to be a differentiated niche leader. AMSC owns useful HTS and power-electronics IP and has won program-level naval and utility work (like a ~$75M Canadian Navy deal). That combination (IP + visible contracts + cash/backlog) is what makes the company interesting to me.

If AMSC consistently convert bookings at decent margins and avoid further dilution, you get margin expansion + multiple re-rating (defense contracts + grid demand are sticky, and their tech is already shipping). If they don’t, downside is fast. Same facts cut both ways. The company has a very relevant set of products as energy grids and fleets demand more power density and stability to integrate wind, solar, rapidly-increasing data center loads and advanced naval systems.

I’m curious to hear from anyone who knows much about AMSC, currently invests in them, or understands their market niche well. Trying to gauge if there’s as much upside left here as it seems.

I just cant help but think the TikTok deal was built into that outlook. Oracle said they signed 3 multi billion dollar contracts but didn’t say which ones. They projected rev this year to be 18B, and by 2029 144B annually. This kind of projected growth by a tech dinosaur, in my opinion should not be met with the kind of surge we just saw. Especially when the company has been missing earnings projections on and off for years. That is a wait and see if I ever saw one.

It just feels like blatant insider trading. Everyone knew Oracle was getting the deal. Everyone knew earnings call was going to be the moment to jump.

*Oklo Inc today holds a groundbreaking ceremony at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for its first Aurora powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”*

*“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.*

*The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.*

*“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”*",85,45,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1no03ff/oklo_breaks_ground_on_first_aurora_powerhouse/,new,Company News,0.92

What is a good strategy to capitalize on a still very young industry with new players joining every day? I'm currently seeing three main segments that drive revenue with a TAM that's rapidly expanding across all three segments:

**Infrastructure**
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft and Oracle are building chips and datacenters to generate compute. All of the MAG7 companies are investing heavily in their own facilities to become a big player in the scene without any sign of slowing down.

**Data**
The place the internet comes together is a goldmine for LLM's to be trained on. Places Like X (Twitter) (owned by xAI) GitHub (owned by Microsoft, very valuable for coding), Stack overflow, Wikipedia, Quora, but maybe the biggest and most valuable of them all, yes, Reddit. A very important aspect of why Reddit's conversations are very valuable is because there is no money incentive like on X. The company has gone public in 2024 and has done licensing deals with Google and OpenAI and others worth 200M+ annually. They are reportedly currently in talks with Google for a much bigger deal. The platform is imo mildly monetized and thus growing rapidly. A company worth looking into financially.

**Applications**
Probably the biggest and widest segment that has yet to fully materialize is the way AI has been putting itself on the market as a product. The most obvious applications are LLM's like ChatGPT, but OpenAI is not close to profitability. Self-Driving cars are also slowly being applied, but in low numbers. Public companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and Palantir are among a bigger group of companies well positioned to thrive in this segment.

AI is no longer just a buzzword. The companies that control infrastructure, data, or applications are setting the rules of the game. The next few years are going to separate the leaders from the followers. If you’re looking to understand where value is being created, AI is still a an early opportunity.",1,19,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nny89w/long_term_ai_strategy/,new,Industry Discussion,0.52

Do we think profit will eventually matter?,"A lot of people were dubious about how OpenAI would be able to afford the (up to) $300 billion contract they signed with Oracle.. well now we know part of the answer is Nvidia investing (up to) $100 billion into OpenAI

And both companies (OpenAI and Oracle) will spend the majority of their compute dollars on Nvidia GPUs

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

All the while I don't think these AI companies with consumer and business-facing software are actually making any money from these ventures (or at least a lot of them aren't). They seem to be surviving and thriving entirely based off of this circular investment scheme

Do you think there's an underlying risk here? Or will this just last forever until eventually companies like OpenAI start making mountains of profits?

First, let’s state the obvious: we’re not in a low-rate environment right now. However there are some things happening that are leading to one. Regardless of your views of the current U.S. president, he’s been pushing Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. So far, Powell has remained focused on the economic data and stayed independent in his decision-making. However, Powell’s term ends in about eight months (May 15, 2026). Once that happens, it seems almost inevitable that Trump will try to appoint someone more in line with his agenda, someone who will likely push for rate cuts until his target rate of around 1.5% is reached (this seems to be the consensus, though I’ve seen various estimates).

If/when that happens, I expect markets to take off for the foreseeable future. Why? Because lower rates mean cheaper borrowing. A simple(although flawed as mortgage loans are amortized amongst other things) example:

A $500K home at 2% interest would cost roughly $665K over 30 years (assuming no early payments).

A $500K home at 6% interest would cost $1.1 million over the same period.

This is basic economics, lower interest rates increase borrowing power, which lets companies expand faster and take on more risk.

Does this mean we’re heading for another major recession or depression eventually? Probably. But that timing is much harder to predict than the markets’ current expectation that a low-rate environment is coming.",51,30,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nntg89/in_a_low_rates_environment_nearly_all_equities/,new,Broad market news,0.78

1. Eli Lilly (LLY) – With its advanced immuno-oncology pipeline and existing blockbusters, it feels almost unavoidable. What stands out is their ability to diversify revenue while staying a leader in such a competitive field.


2. Pfizer (PFE) – Known for vaccines, but their oncology division is getting stronger with targeted acquisitions. Despite the post-COVID slump, I think they remain a solid long-term player in cancer treatment.


3. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) – Probably one of the most robust oncology portfolios. Their CAR-T therapies look very promising, and while the stock price isn’t exploding right now, I believe it’s one to keep on the radar.



The only issue on my side: I’m still pretty new to stocks.  I noticed that some crypto platforms like Bitget are starting to list tokenized US stocks and RWAs, I’m not sure if that is very similar to traditional broker.

This is quite the circular economy we got going here. By investing in the deeply unprofitable startup that buys their product, they ensure demand for their products remains strong.

Probably the right move for Nvidia, because a lot of this money will come back to them, and they can sell their hardware at high Margins. And with their stock trading at 50x earnings, it makes sense to spend their cash flow on funding/acquiring AI startups rather than buying back shares.

Historically, gold and the markets have been divergent. When people are optimistic, they pile into the markets. When they get worried, they move into gold. It's pretty rare to see them both hitting ATHs at the same time. I am curious to hear your thoughts on this.

From my perspective, it seems all of society is bifurcated right now on just about everything. We have a large group of Chicken Little's, that think this is all going to blow up in our faces any day now. Even Warren/Berkshire is holding a record amount of cash and more T-Bills that the Treasury itself ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/why-warren-buffett-s-berkshire-hathaway-now-owns-more-treasury-bills-than-the-federal-reserve-11807572)). Conversely, we seem to have an equal size group of Pollyanna's that think we are entering into some sort of golden age and manage to find a silver lining in every bit of news (pun intended). I am somewhat agnostic and think both groups are not seeing things too clearly. At the end of the day, it is the optimistic crowd that drives the markets and set the prices. If they keep thinking they are getting a good deal and remain willing buy what the others are selling, and they believe in it enough to hold, then the markets will just keep going up or possibly plateau for a while until some external event drives them in either direction.

There is lots of money going into specific buckets right now, such as AI and crypto, which is also hitting ATHs. I have no idea what people think they will do with the stupid amount of money flowing into crypto and its offshoot financial products (other than trying to make a quick buck). And I think all the AI plays will take much longer to shake out and find the winners and losers than most people think (like the dot-com era). I view AI stocks with mind numbing P/Es, precious metals, and crypto as all something investors would need a high level of conviction and a buy-and-hold mindset to buy into right now at these levels. And I question how much conviction is really there.

With both groups (Chicken Little's and Pollyanna's) buying into both sides of fear and optimism, it seems like every scenario is priced in. It's like a double bubble face-off that just keeps growing, just waiting for something to happen. Even if more geopolitical turmoil erupts and/or inflation starts ticking back up with high unemployment, are people really going to buy in more to precious metals when they are at ATHs already? Without hitting the bottom line in spectacular fashion, is there any development that can get AI more hyped and inflated while we wait for it to generate a real ROI somewhere? And what if nothing happens at all and things more-or-less stay the same economically and geopolitically?",992,343,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnpqxs/markets_and_gold_are_both_hitting_aths_last_time/,new,Unknown,0.93

Now, the company wants a second win.

Starting on Monday, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema will hear arguments in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on how to fix Google’s monopoly over some online advertising technology. The judge ruled this year that Google had broken the law to protect its dominance over the largely invisible system of technology that places ads on pages across the web. The hearing is expected to last for two to three weeks.

The Justice Department has said it wants Google to sell the technology it uses to connect buyers and sellers of ad space, among other potential remedies. Google has instead proposed measures including changing its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers.

Judge Brinkema’s ultimate decision could disrupt the company’s $3.1 trillion business and help rewrite the playbook for tech dominance in the modern internet era.

After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

- Goldman Sachs have initiated coverage of RR with a Buy rating, with a target of £12.90 /  $17.40  - recognising the turnaround story since covid, and the huge profit margin and FCF improvements in recent years.

- Citigroup have upgraded their price target to £14.40 / $19.44.
(The difference appears to be that Citigroup have recognised how massively exciting the Nuclear Energy side of the business is, whereas Goldman haven’t even mentioned it.)

- The vast majority of analysts are rating RR a buy. 
 
- Saudi Arabia Railways will be using more Rolls-Royce engines in their trains than before. Since 2012, there have been seventy 12V 4000 engines used in trains operated by Saudi Arabia Railways, and – having been impressed by their quality even in the harshest of conditions – Saudi Arabia have ordered an additional 50 trains with RR engines, as announced a month ago. A statement on the quality of their engines - not only in planes !

- Rolls’s Power Systems division has received its largest ever Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) order, after Lithuanian energy supplier Ignitis selected Rolls-Royce to supply large-scale battery energy storage systems, in a huge deal announced last week.

Sure I’ve missed so many things there as all the many divisions of Rolls-Royce seems to be on turbo charge at the moment.

With aviation demand rising (and especially from Airbus more than Boeing),  with defence spending rising, and with the growing and desperate need for more sustainable energy solutions from nuclear, etc etc, it is inevitable that Rolls-Royce will be announcing more deals on all fronts in the coming weeks and months.  
[…and it can only help to be having dinner with the Trump and Starmer last week!]

On this basis, I believe we will £20 within the next 12 months =  74% higher than we are here.  And longer term it’ll be multiples of where it is today. And it is all backed up by solid real results - real revenues, real profit, and real deals worth billions.

I understand it’s pretty obvious markets would react negatively but how detrimental really would a large scale war in Europe be financially? 

Russia’s control of oil supply could send gas prices soaring but what about the economic impact from Eastern Europe at war? Russia doesn’t seem to be ready for a full scale war against NATO and seems to be testing the waters but they are preparing to do so. I think if we see congressmen start selling off their stocks like we saw before COVID that would be a great sell signal to GTFO before the market crashes. 

Historically how have markets reacted to large scale wars? We haven’t really had a large scale war since WW2 so we don’t have recent examples to go off of except maybe around 9/11 and the beginning of war in the Middle East but that doesn’t affect global markets like a war in Europe would. I also assume investing in defense contractors would turn out to be very profitable.

1nn8wd5,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 20:59:38,The reason I’m shorting Harley-Davidson (HOG),"I decided to buy the $23, 1/15/27 puts for Harley-Davidson. I’ve been doing some research and have come to the conclusion that this would make a good short:

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley’s are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley’s. When economic conditions are rough, there’s not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn’t be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been sharply declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is “motorcycles are dangerous”. Anyone who rides motorcycles, knows someone who has been injured or killed on a bike. It is not very uncommon in the community.

6. The overall state of the market makes me nervous. Everything’s great until it isn’t and I want to have a hedge against a potential downturn in the market. I think this company would be more heavily affected than anything else I could choose from.

Those are the main points. I’m sure there are some more that you guys could think of but I thought I would share what I thought about Harley Davidson.",145,91,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nn8wd5/the_reason_im_shorting_harleydavidson_hog/,new,Company Discussion,0.83

1nm567c,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 14:07:12,The Future of RDDT Stock,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.

> SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Friday it would ask companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B worker visas, prompting some big tech companies to warn visa holders to stay in the U.S. or quickly return.

> The change could deal a big blow to the technology sector that relies heavily on skilled workers from India and China.

> The move could add millions of dollars in costs for companies, which could hit smaller tech firms and start-ups particularly hard.

> Reuters was not immediately able to establish how the fee would be administered.

Even after all the interest you would pay on the margin funds, I would practically be a millionaire.  

Let’s be real here.  Stocks ALWAYS go up.  Look at the last 20 years.  We have had 9/11, the financial meltdown of 2008 and the worst pandemic in 100 years that completely shut down the economy and stocks STILL have went up substantially during all that turmoil.  

So despite overwhelming historical evidence that says otherwise, why do people always say to stay away from Margin?

This deviation could be a setup for an October treat that leads to a strong fourth quarter.

**iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF** **(TLT)**:  This long-term Treasury bond has gained price appreciation over the past month from the expected and subsequent federal interest rate cut this past Wednesday.  It is moving higher along with stocks from the interest rate cut, with two more likely rate cuts before the end of this year.  It peaked at $172.25 on Aug 6th, 2020, and has never gone below $80 for the past 23 years.  The Treasury Bond ETFs do not have the price action of stocks and other ETFs, but it is also less risky with a limited bottom and a significantly higher monthly dividend yield. Yields from Treasury Bond ETFs are subject to federal tax, but are exempt from state and local taxes. 

**SPDR Gold Shares (GLD):**  Gold has hit an ATH without much hype and is likely to benefit from the upcoming multiple interest rate cuts.

**Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS):**  This ETF has up 20% since June and shows that money continues to flow into dominant cloud, AI, and digital infrastructure.  The price appreciation of Magnificent 7 is pointing to a supercycle that will likely lead to one of the strongest fourth quarters.

1nltilf,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 05:16:54,Indian Market Data Shows ESG Scores Flip Normal Price Discovery Rules,"Market mechanics just got weird. A recent analysis of Indian stocks shows that companies split into two trading patterns purely based on their ESG ratings:

* High ESG companies → spot market leads futures (completely backwards from normal).
* Low ESG companies → futures market leads spot (as expected).

Futures are supposed to lead because they’re cheaper and more efficient. Yet somehow, ESG flips the script.

What’s wilder: the effect isn’t uniform.

* Banking & IT → bidirectional causality, no matter the ESG score.
* Cement, oil & gas, pharma → high ESG firms drove spot-led discovery.
* FMCG & autos → low ESG firms showed futures-led dynamics.

My take: post-COVID inflows into good companies might have made spot trading hypersensitive, leaving futures lagging. For traders, it suggests that ESG leaders vs. laggards, the traditional playbook won't work.

1nlsjr7,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 04:15:18,Investment Strategy,"Hello everyone. 

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I’m doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I’ve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I’ve never had much of a strategy, I’ve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I’ve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in “core” growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in “moonshots” like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. 

The issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max. 

I struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I’m up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there. 

At the same time, it’s becoming almost impossible to manage 33 stocks at once effectively. 

How can I remain cold & calculated? Should I just sell all my smaller positions now, take the money & focus on my new strategy?",0,11,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nlsjr7/investment_strategy/,new,Advice Request,0.5
1nlrvhd,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 03:31:36,Bears only hope remaining to maul the bulls,"I am not a bear or a bull I am bullish but alot more cautious than most and wont fomo into some of the stocks I have been watching as I know its a dangerous time when people think the market is easy.
Anyway bears have been slaughtered recently and perma bulls are making money and most people are in the delusional stage of the rally and see no way down. 
Whilst this is unlikely I can seen one major way in which the market could turn ugly, its a black swan event so unlikely but its always good to account for black swans as they have a disproportionate negative impact.
I think energy prices mainly oil and gas are low right now and thus support the fed when it comes to their expansionary monetary policy, cutting rates to boost the job market and stocks love that. However, if we were to get a supply side shock because of one of a number of reasons such as an escalating war then this would mean inflation would become rampant like in the 70s and the fed would have to raise rates or create a class war or major social unrest. At the minimum they could not cut anymore, this seems unlikely and is not a prediction but any reason for a significant spike in inflation which has already been high since Covid would be the bears last hope.
It would tank the market imo or cause some if the worse violence and social problems since 1929 and the rise if the far right.
Something like this is not likely now but in Europe or the Us I can see something like this being fairly probable in the next 3 or 4 years in an already vulnerable underlining economy.

Just to clarify not a prediction, more something to start debate on potential causes of high inflation and a stock crash or alternatively if you think there is another factor at play more likely to stop fed easing and cause a major slow down.

I know they have that $24.5B ATM shelf open, which means they can issue more shares basically any time. Based on some modeling I did, here’s what another raise might look like:
	•	If they raise $2B at $60/share, that’s roughly 33M new shares → about 15% dilution.
	•	If price tanks to $30 and they raise $2B, that’s 66M shares → closer to 30% dilution (way worse).
	•	If price rips to $100 and they raise $2B, it’s only 7.5% dilution (pretty mild).

Historically, they tend to announce raises when share price + ETH price are strong so I’d expect the next dilution within the next 3–6 months if conditions stay favorable.

My big fear is: if they hit us with a big raise and the market sells off, this could easily drop to $55 or even $49 support levels fast.

Not including ~~degenerate~~ traders, most investors want to protect the gains from the Covid era. Looking at allocations into meaningful domestic and international index portions could be very protective, especially if you are closer to retirement.

Counterpoint: US AI growth could lead to fresh valuations and global market innovation.

1nlf722,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 16:54:37,"SPT Sprout Social - Big upside move ahead, AI and Social Media","Hi everyone,

with this post I want to introduce the company Sprout Social (Nasdaq: SPT) and explain why, in my view, buying the stock could pay off over the mid to long term.

**1) About Sprout Social:**  
Sprout Social, Inc. is a U.S.-based provider of cloud software for social media management. From one central platform you can schedule and publish posts, handle comments and messages, run performance analytics, and monitor social conversations. Sprout Social serves roughly 30,000 customers in 100+ countries and is among the leaders in this space. The business model is Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with recurring subscription revenue.

Sprout Social was founded in 2010 and went public in 2019. Headquarters are in Chicago, with offices in Seattle, Dublin, and Kraków, among others. The company currently employs over 1,300 people worldwide and has received multiple awards for its products and customer satisfaction (including #1 Best Software Product 2024 according to G2).

Market cap: 0.84 billion (Prior year: 1.6 billion, -47.5%)  
Revenue: 0.45 billion FY 2025 (Prior year: 0.4 billion, +12.5%)

**2) Risks (just Sprout specific, of course there are more overall)**  
\- Sprout Social still reports GAAP losses of 57 million in 2024. However, it operates profitably on a non-GAAP basis. If Sprout fails to manage costs effectively, particularly in areas like sales, marketing, and research and development, or if it cannot accelerate revenue growth, the path to full profitability may be delayed.

\- The declining market cap is a consequence of the lack of GAAP profitability and the slowdown in revenue growth over the past few months.

\- SBC: The company reports non-GAAP profits despite reporting GAAP losses due to a high amount. At least the SBC rate has remained stable: Q2/2025 reported SBC expenses of $20.2 million, which is almost unchanged from the prior year ($20.6 million). Additionally, SBC’s total expenses for the first half of 2025 were just under $40 million, compared to $38.7 million in the prior year.

**3) Opportunities**  
\- In the era of AI, data scale plays a crucial role. Sprout Social, for instance, connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this data scale.

\- Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance.

\- Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.

**4) Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:**  
\- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

\- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

\- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.

1nl7vt4,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 12:14:02,Jerome Powell on the labor market and why they chose to cut rates,"All direct quotes from the fed meeting:


“In the labor market, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August but remains little changed over the past year at a relatively low level. Payroll job gains have slowed significantly to a pace of just 29 thousand per month over the past three months. A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force, due to lower immigration and lower labor force participation. Even so, labor demand has softened and the recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the “breakeven” rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. In addition, wage growth has continued to moderate while still outpacing inflation. Overall, the marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers is unusual. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. In our SEP, the median projection for the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and edges down thereafter.
Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the Consumer Price Index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent. These readings are higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up. In contrast, disinflation appears to be continuing for services. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about tariffs, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.0 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent in 2026 and to 2.1 percent in 2027.
Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4-1/4 percent and to continue reducing the size of our balance sheet.“

1nl2uoj,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 08:57:26,$CDTX: H5 bird flu results are in,"Yesterday I flagged that the results from a study to evaluate in vivo efficacy of Cidara's CD388 pre-exposure prophylaxis against H5N1 (bird flu) would be presented today at the ISRV conference in Singapore. The results are now out ( [A single prophylactic dose of CD388  provides protection against highly  pathogenic bovine-origin Influenza  A virus in the ferret model](https://www.cidara.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ISRV-2025-Cidara-CD388_H5N1_Andreevl-FINAL.pdf)).  The study results were presented by Konstantin Andreev, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

**Key findings:**

This is the first in-vivo demonstration of CD388 against H5, building on prior in-vitro data.

In the ferret model (the gold standard for flu):

\***A single prophylactic dose protected against lethal H5 challenge.**

\* ≥10 mg/kg = 100% protection, with dose-response observed (3 mg/kg = 75%, 1 mg/kg = 25%).

\*Treated animals showed reduced weight loss, fewer symptoms, and no systemic spread or neuroinvasion.

\*CD388 also reduced viral shedding and cleared virus from the upper respiratory tract by Day 9.

**Why it matters:**

\*Confirms CD388’s potential as a **true pan-influenza prophylaxis**, not just seasonal.

\*Strengthens the **pandemic preparedness** story.  This is the type of data BARDA and other governments look for when deciding on stockpiling/contract awards.

\*Reinforces the idea that CD388 carries **strategic “insurance value”** on top of its seasonal high-risk market.

 

**Next milestones to watch:**

1.      End-of-Phase 2b FDA minutes (expected shortly): Looking for confirmation of an accelerated Fall ’25 Phase 3 start vs. planned spring 2026 base case.  May also confirm if Ph2b counts as pivotal, allowing for shorter phase 3. News on  Breakthrough Therapy Designation could also be included.

2.      BARDA decision on grant application.  CEO has said a decision is expected by year-end (unclear if fiscal or calendar). This is the next potential big non-dilutive funding catalyst.

**Bottom line:** Seasonal flu alone supports my conservative $445 (!) share rNPV. With H5 protection confirmed in vivo, CD388 is positioned not just as a seasonal prophylaxis but as a potential pandemic countermeasure, which  strengthens the case for BARDA funding and stockpiling.

Earlier this week, President Donald Trump proposed the idea that companies should no longer provide earnings reports on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead. The SEC said the agency is actively looking into that plan.

“At President Trump’s request, Chairman \[Paul\] Atkins and the SEC is prioritizing this proposal to further eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies,” an agency spokesperson said earlier.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed by just a majority vote on the SEC, where Republicans currently hold a 3-1 voting majority, with one open seat.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",117,56,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,new,Industry Discussion,0.89

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1nksav5,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 23:00:45,UPS Has A Limited Downside From This Price,"United Parcel Service (UPS) $85

**Industry/Sector/Type –  – – Transportation/Goods/Cyclical** 

Biggest catalyst for the stock – High dividend yield and low valuation, scraping the bottom of the barrel for “value” stocks. Cautious buy, expecting a limited downside.

**Positives**

**Low Valuation:** United Parcel Service trades at a decade-low valuation of 12x earnings, which doesn’t give enough credit to its pivot from low-margin Amazon volumes towards higher-value customers. I believe that in a few years, UPS should improve operating margins significantly from the current 9% to about 12% with better paying customers.

**Healthcare logistics market:** The healthcare logistics market is estimated to grow at 9-10% to $82Bn, and UPS has plans to double revenues from this segment to $20Bn by 2026. This is a significantly higher valued market with a lot of specialized functions - storage, handling, and time-sensitive transportation, essential when you're delivering medicine, biologics, and medical devices. The $87Bn UPS has a competitive advantage over smaller carries, because it has a lot of infrastructure in place - such as temperature-controlled storage in several locations to cater this industry from clinical trials to patient deliveries. The best part of course, premium pricing. 

**Cost cutting and operational improvements:**  Here are the key points of UPS $3.5B cost reduction program:

* Reducing 20,000 jobs in 2025, across operations and management, with voluntary buyouts.
* Closing 73 facilities as part of a broader consolidation.
* Automating 64% of operations.
* 35% of reductions will come from operational roles, and 30% from Capex.
* Consolidating package routes.
* Raising revenue per piece by dropping less-profitable customers and increasing rates on retained volume

**Negatives**

**Under performer** – In the past decade the stock has lost 14%, with a very high percentage of Amazon’s business, which hurt margins. It has fallen significantly off a high of $203 from 2022. 

**Lack of forward guidance** – turnaround efforts have flattered to only deceive, two recent examples, it pulled its 2025 revenue and profit outlook in April and again withheld from providing targets in July. 

**Tariff uncertainty**  – the US-China trade being a key contributor to the lack of clarity. The demise of the de minimis exclusion of merchandise below $800 from tariffs is hurting UPS.

**Valuation**

After 15% and 4% earnings and revenues drops in 2025, I do expect UPS to return to 10-11% earnings growth and 2-4% revenue growth for the next 3 years.

A market cap of just $71Bn against $87Bn in sales is attractive. Add to that a historically low P/E of 12, and a dividend yield of 7.5%,

**High yield** – its dividend yield of 7.5% looks safe for now. **This a cautious buy.** The only caveat is that we still have a lot of trade uncertainty, and if the turnaround takes longer, this could fall even further, but I believe the downside is limited from here.

Its stock has been trending down in recent months due to slow guidance and potential AI and low-code platforms chipping away at their core business, which is vertical software solutions in niche spaces such as healthcare, agriculture, utilities, and transportation.

What do folks think are good questions to ask to grasp their plan for AI, and what do you think their responses will be?

Building up a foundry business is crucial for Intel to execute its turnaround and compete more closely with the world-leading Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.

> “This looks like a product deal, not a foundry deal,” at least at the moment, Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note. “But frankly Intel can use the help on the product business just as much given share position in key markets has been bleeding.”

...

> The agreement shows how some industry executives view efforts to help Intel as a way to win favor with the Trump administration. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son saw his recent investment in Intel as a way to appeal to the president.
> 
> Trump administration officials have been talking to Huang and other chip-industry leaders from AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for months about how they could potentially help Intel. Lutnick has discussed possible financial help and ways they could boost Intel’s manufacturing business.

...

> Because of the government’s involvement in both Nvidia and Intel, many around the industry raised an eyebrow at Thursday’s deal.

> “It is perhaps unprecedented that a company with a unique revenue sharing agreement with the U.S. government is investing so much money in a company that’s partially owned by the U.S. government,” said Ryan Fedasiuk, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

This makes me doubt the long term prospects for Intel here. It seems like Nvidia is investing this money to help their China export prospects and gain favor with the current admin, and it won't help Intel's foundry struggles.. so that means TSMC will likely continue being the winner regardless

Why it matters:

* **H5 is high-mortality flu** with pandemic potential.
* **CD388 has already shown in-vitro activity against H5**. Tomorrow’s readout is **in-vivo.**   If results are good, that’s additional proof of **broad, pan-influenza prophylaxis** beyond just seasonal strains.
* Governments care about (and pay for!) **pandemic preparedness**. Positive H5 data could bolster the case for BARDA stockpiling, the next potential big non-dilutive funding catalyst for Cidara.

My baseline rNPV ([CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)) only accounts for seasonal high-risk cohorts in High Income Countries (HICs).

Strong H5 data increases the probability of **optional upside** :  
• Pandemic preparedness contracts (BARDA, ex-U.S. stockpiles).  
• A strong pandemic countermeasure story supports the strategic “insurance value” of CD388 and could lead to a reduction in the “skepticism discount” that seems to be currently applied to the asset.

The results won’t change my conservative base case on valuation right away, but it adds meaningful **optionality that isn’t included in my model yet**.

The shares shall be purchased at a price no higher than the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent purchase bid on Nasdaq Stockholm and in accordance with the restrictions relating to price in the Safe Harbor Regulation.
Buybacks may only be effected in accordance with the restrictions regarding volume for acquisitions of own shares stated in the Rulebook and in the Safe Harbor Regulation.

1nk3147,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 04:48:13,$APLD DD AI Datacenters huge run from $3 --> $20 since April,"I think $APLD  deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story. 

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.

basically they use AI , analytics and consulting to help ecommerce brands optimize marketing channels and relevant data.

some key financials pulled from their s-1

revenue climbed 29% from 1.366b to 1.796b from 2023 to 2024

gross margin from 44% to 43.5% from 2023 to 2024

the company is in a rare position these days to have stable profits and operating cash flows before IPO 

19.8m net profit in 2023 to 42.5m in 2024

the IPO at its current range would price the company at 2.7x sales. this seems quite undervalued to me for topline growing close to 30% and with stable cash flows and profits

I've held some stocks (BAC, AMZN, GOOG, SOFI, and a few others), that I have had for years (so I won't be taxed at short gain tax at least).

By now they've gotten at/over, or very close to, 100% returns. Now some of them give dividends even if it's very little (BAC and GOOG), so it's more incentive to hold them even longer term. 

I ASSUME these companies (well most of them) will be around long enough for me to hold another 30ish years before I retire, which is currently where I'm leaning towards.....BUT that's my opinion, and I feel it'd be foolish not to take other views that I might not have thought of into account. How do you all decide to take profit (minus life changing choices events like buying a house, medical or other type of emergency, etc etc)?

1njy059,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 23:42:38,Zillow Will Benefit Strongly From A Housing Rebound,"**Zillow (Z) $90.75,  Planning to add tomorrow morning**

**Industry/Sector/Type - - - Housing Marketplace/Platform/Steady growth tied to housing cyclicality.**

**Biggest catalyst for the stock** \- If interest/mortgage rates keep reducing and housing bottoms out, this could be a better way to play the housing rebound. It’s asset light, a market leader with a lot of scale and has emerged much stronger in the housing sector decline.

The great fight against inflation, which saw the Fed funds rate shoot up from 0.25% to over 5% in a short 16 months from March 22 to July 2023 felled the overbought, overpriced housing industry, which is still struggling to recover two years after its peak. Existing home and new home sales peaked around Q1-2022 at 6.1Mn and 1Mn units respectively. Now, they’re down 33% to 37% from that peak to just 4Mn and 625K units. **However, prices have dropped only 5% to 7% from their respective peaks and at a 6.5% mortgage rate continues to be a severe impediment to any kind of a rebound.**  
But if the housing market rebounds as housing cycles normally do with lower interest rates, I think Zillow would be a great way to take advantage of it.

**What’s positive about Zillow?**  
**Market leadership** \- dominant online buying and rental platform, with over 60% market share.  Zillow's housing app makes it the most visited real estate site in the US, with an estimated 243M Monthly unique users over its various platforms, with its engagement levels several notches above its competitors.

**Rental revenue** \- Rentals are now 25% of revenues, growing at 36%. With housing increasing unaffordable for younger cohorts, Zillow's has focused on rental demand by building a multiple listing service (MLS) on steroids. Its largest supply comes from multi-family landlords, growing at 45%. Its scale, reach and heft give it operating leverage even with lower revenue growth,  growing revenue per user and better conversion rates than smaller competitors. Zillow also gets high margin ancillary revenue from after-market services, such as title, mortgage financing, and escrow services.

**Beating the industry** \- Its For-Sale business is still growing even as new and existing home sales continue to decline.  
**Earnings growth** of over 30% expected with 14% revenue growth in the next three years.  
**Strong earnings momentum** \- beat in the first two quarters of 2025.  
**Lower mortgage rates could goose housing** \- with labor markets weakening, I believe that the 25 basis point cut is the start of declining interest rates, which would give the moribund housing industry a decent boost. I now believe that Zillow is a better long-term option than homebuilders to play housing at much lower risk.

**Zillow had wasted a significant amount of money, time and resources with its first-party home-flipping business, which they exited. Thank God! That was a disaster.**

**Negatives, challenges and risks**

**Housing cycle needs to recover** \- Poor existing, and new home sales, combined with still high prices and mortgage rates suggest that the housing cycle still has a long way to recovery.

**Stock could remain range bound** \- The stock has been on a tear gaining 44% over the last 12 months, much of the first two quarter’s earnings growth could be priced in.

**Stagnant housing market** \- A stagnant housing market has resulted in poor listing volume and even fewer transactions.

**Cyclical industry** \- It cannot escape housing cycles.

**Prices still high** \- Home prices need to drop further, they’re just 5 to 7% below the 2022 peak.

**The dispute with Compass could derail growth** \- The large real estate brokerage platform, Compass’ use of private “pocket listings,” reduces the availability of listings on Zillow’s site, attacking Zillow’s business strategy of aggregating the largest number of listings. Should this practice continue with other brokerages, the business will fragment, diminishing Zillow’s appeal as having the the largest inventory of listings.

To be sure with the 44% rally, the stock is already priced at 39x 2026 earnings, growing at 30%, with a forward PEG of 1.3, Similarly it quotes 7x 2026 sales growing at 14%. Not terrible, but no longer cheap either.

However, if housing recovers, we're still getting in close to the market trough. More importantly, Zillow has used the housing downturn to emerge stronger and gain market share at the expense of weaker rivals.

1njv8wk,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 21:26:21,Mark Zuckerberg unveils $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses,"Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display.

The glasses, which costs $799, contain a small digital display that can be controlled via hand gestures through a wristband powered by neural technology, confirming a CNBC report in August. A promotional video of the new smart glasses appeared on Meta’s YouTube page on Monday but was later removed.

The new smart glasses are a bridge between the company’s audio-only Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and the experimental Orion augmented reality glasses that the company revealed at last year’s Connect event. Orion can overlay 3D visuals over a person’s real-world field of view with the help of a wireless computing puck, but the glasses are expensive to make and not yet available to consumers.

The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses come with the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that allows users to control the device using hand gestures.

“These are glasses with the classic style that you’d expect from Ray-Ban, but they’re the first AI glasses with a high resolution display and a fully weighted Meta neural band,” Zuckerberg said.

With the new glasses, people can do tasks like watch videos through the display or see and respond to text messages, Zuckerberg said. The display doesn’t block a person’s view, and it disappears when not being used, he said.

The glasses go on sale in the U.S. on Sept. 30.

The company on Wednesday also debuted the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses, intended for athletes who participate in high-intensity sports like snowboarding and mountain biking. The Oakley-branded glasses will cost $499 when they launch on Oct. 21, making it $100 more expensive than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses that went on sale in June.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses have a sportier look than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses thanks to a wraparound design that extends its colorful lenses around a person’s temples. Unlike the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, the new model contains a button on the underside of its frames so that athletes who wear helmets can more easily capture photos and videos.

The new sports-centric smart glasses have up to nine hours of battery life, can capture 3K video and contain speakers that are louder than their predecessors. The glasses can connect with Garmin-branded fitness watches to track certain stats like their heart rates using the Meta AI assistant. Preorders start today.

Meta also debuted the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the latest version of the company’s original smart glasses. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) costs $379, up from $299 for the version released in 2023. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) has double the battery life of the previous model, lasting 8 hours on a single charge, and a more powerful camera that can capture 3K Ultra HD video. The new glasses go on sale today.

Zuckerberg also announced Horizon TV, pitching it as a way to watch television shows, sporting events and movies using the company’s Quest VR headsets. Some of Meta’s partners who will be contributing content to the app include Disney and Universal Pictures, Zuckerberg said.

>Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.

>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen.

>In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4‑1/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Jefferson; Alberto G. Musalem; Jeffrey R. Schmid; and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action was Stephen I.

1. Uber just invested 300 million dollars to partner with Lucid on a 20,000 unit robotaxi fleet built on the Gravity SUV platform. This is a huge validation of both Gravity and Lucid’s tech, with the first launch planned in the US next year
2. Saudi PIF backing is still solid which means financial support is not going away
3. The Gravity SUV launch on the consumer side adds another growth angle beyond the Air sedan
4. EV names often move together. Any rally in Tesla, Rivian or the sector can give Lucid a sympathy lift
5. Cost cutting has started to show up in the financials and management is working on margins
6. The reverse split has already played out and most weak holders are gone which reduces negative sentiment
7. Lucid is no longer trading like a penny stock which means bigger institutions can step in
8. Central bank policy leaning more dovish supports high growth names like Lucid by lowering funding pressure

Lucid still has risks with burn and execution but Uber’s endorsement adds credibility and institutions may look at the stock differently now.

1njfr5i,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 11:08:48,Uranium/Nuclear Equities irrationally sinking due to China 'ban' on NVIDIA's AI chips. The reality is uranium is in seriously short supply.,"Obviously this ban (actually the Chinese government telling Chinese companies to avoid NVIDIA's AI chips) is bringing down NVIDIA stocks today. But it looks like it is also affecting Uranium and Nuclear. Sprott and VanEck Uranium/Nuclear ETFs are down up to a half percent as I type this, for example. However, this ""instruction"" by the Chinese government *does not affect the building boom of data centres in the western world*. These data centres are still being built at a record pace in America and elsewhere.

Consider first that it is recognized that there is impending uranium shortage because of this data centre building boom and widely predicted energy shortage. There is simply not enough uranium being mined and processed today to keep up with a very real future demand.

And on top of this, there is a growing understanding that a more reliable and 'green' source of stable power is required for the next 50 years or so, until 'renewable' energy can do this. Currently green can definitely supply large amounts of power, but the stability at grid scale is still a work in progress.

Nuclear is in such high demand, that even retired nuclear generating stations are being refurbished and brought back online. And at least 5 countries in Europe are either extending the lives of current reactors, and/or are also building new ones.

Even Canada is upping its nuclear game. A sure sign that nuclear is winning, over purely wind and solar solutions. It is expanding its nuclear capacity. The Bruce Generating Station in Ontario has almost completed adding two new reactors, which will make it once again the largest nuclear generating station in the world. And Ontario's Darlington nuclear generating station (currently with 4 reactors) will be adding 4 new SMRs which was just announced by the PM. And Alberta is looking seriously at building a nuclear generating station. If Canada is doing this, nuclear is mainstream.

It is expected that an announcement can happen at the annual meeting in a couple of weeks on Sep 30 or even announced earlier.

the reason why Warren outperforms the market & loves insurance, is because insurers reinvests their profits. For Warren & Geico, they rolled their profits & reinvest into equity, which allows them to make outsized returns. Bill Ackman wants to replicate this success.

Based on his vision, a P&C insurer is his most likely choice, as reserve requirements are low which allows for reinvestment and it also follows the Geico playbook pretty well.

LMND mcap is too high(4.2B), HIPO mcap is too small & unprofitable, ROOT makes sense(1.5B) but management has always mentioned that they wanted to grow ROOT to be larger than PGR, so that is likely out of the pic, as ROOT takes the solo approach.

I do not see Bill investing in health insurance due to his past criticism of UNH. Nor is he investing in life insurance due to the higher reserve requirements. Speciality insurance is also too niched with less TAM. Also many MGA's have terrible balance sheets with negative tangible equity (GSHD, RYAN, TWFG, etc)

This partnership raises some interesting questions for me. for a while, the market's been obsessed with robotaxis, but the b2b robobus model seems more stable, with predictable, long-term revenue. how do we value a company focused on this niche, given that most of the public comps are in the robotaxi space?

* **IEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Focuses on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 7 and 10 years. It provides a middle ground between the low risk of short-term bonds and the high volatility of long-term bonds
* **TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Concentrates on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities over 20 years. This gives it a high duration, meaning it is highly sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates.
* **GOVT (iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF):** Provides exposure to the entire U.S. Treasury yield curve, from short- to long-term. Its blended maturity profile reduces volatility compared to a long-duration fund like TLT but also limits its upside if long rates fall.
* **GOVZ (iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF):** The most aggressive option, holding zero-coupon STRIPS. Its long duration makes it extremely sensitive to interest rate changes. It is a high-risk investment and not typically for investors seeking broad Treasury exposure.

Lyft stock rocketed 20% higher on the news.

Riders in Nashville will be able to hail a Waymo robotaxi through the Waymo One app, and Lyft will add Waymo robotaxis to its platform over time, the companies said in a joint statement on Wednesday.

Lyft “will provide end-to-end fleet management services including vehicle readiness and maintenance, infrastructure, and depot operations in Nashville,” for the Waymo fleet, the companies said.

Waymo, which is owned by Alphabet, has taken a big lead in the U.S. robotaxi market, launching in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well as Austin and Atlanta. It surpassed 10 million paid trips in May, and has plans to start commercial operations next year in Miami, Washington, D.C., Dallas, Denver, and now Nashville.

1nj9v93,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 06:54:22,China bans tech companies from buying Nvidia’s AI chips,"     China’s internet regulator has banned the country’s biggest technology companies from buying Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips, as Beijing steps up efforts to boost its domestic industry and compete with the US.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) told companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s tailor-made product for the country, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Several companies had indicated they would order tens of thousands of the RTX Pro 6000D, and had started testing and verification work with Nvidia’s server suppliers, the people said.

After receiving the CAC order, the companies told their suppliers to stop the work, the people added.

The ban goes beyond earlier guidance from regulators that focused on the H20, Nvidia’s other China-only chip widely used for AI. It comes after Chinese regulators concluded that domestic chips had attained performance comparable to those of Nvidia’s models used in China.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, told reporters in London on Wednesday that he expected to discuss the chipmaker’s ability to do business in China with Donald Trump that evening during the US president’s state visit to the UK.

“We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,” he said. “I’m disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I’m understanding of that. We are patient about it.” 

Beijing is putting pressure on Chinese tech companies to boost the country’s homegrown semiconductor industry and break their reliance on Nvidia so it can compete in an AI race against the US.

“The message is now loud and clear,” said an executive at one of the tech companies. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it’s all hands on deck to build the domestic system.”

Nvidia started producing chips tailored for the Chinese market after former US President Joe Biden banned the company from exporting its most powerful products to China, in an effort to rein in Beijing’s progress on AI.

Beijing’s regulators have recently summoned domestic chipmakers such as Huawei and Cambricon, as well as Alibaba and search engine giant Baidu, which also make their own semiconductors, to report how their products compare against Nvidia’s China chips, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.

They concluded that China’s AI processors had reached a level comparable to or exceeding that of the Nvidia products allowed under export controls, the person added.

China says Nvidia violated antitrust law when it bought Mellanox

The Financial Times reported last month that China’s chipmakers were seeking to triple the country’s total output of AI processors next year.

“The top-level consensus now is there’s going to be enough domestic supply to meet demand without having to buy Nvidia chips,” said an industry insider.

Nvidia introduced the RTX Pro 6000D in July during Huang’s visit to Beijing, when the US company also said Washington was easing its previous ban on the H20 chip.

China’s regulators, including the CAC, have warned tech companies against buying Nvidia’s H20, asking them to justify having purchased them over domestic products, the FT reported last month.

The RTX Pro 6000D, which the company has said could be used in automated manufacturing, was the last product Nvidia was allowed to sell in China in significant volumes.

Alibaba, ByteDance, the CAC and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1nirgbf,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 15:37:42,Microsoft announces $30 billion investment in AI infrastructure in UK,"Microsoft said on Tuesday that it plans to invest $30 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.K. by 2028.

The investment includes $15 billion in capital expenditures and $15 billion in its U.K. operations, Microsoft said. The company said the investment would enable it to build the U.K.’s “largest supercomputer,” with more than 23,000 advanced graphics processing units, in partnership with Nscale, a British cloud computing firm.

The spending commitment comes as President Donald Trump embarks on a state visit to Britain. Trump arrived in the U.K. Tuesday evening and is set to be greeted at Windsor Castle on Wednesday by King Charles and Queen Camilla.

During his visit, all eyes are on U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is under pressure to bring stability to the country after the exit of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over a house tax scandal and a major cabinet reshuffle.

On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said his stance on the U.K. has warmed over the years. He previously criticized the country over its attempt in 2023 to block the tech giant’s $69 billion acquisition of video game developer Activision-Blizzard. The deal was cleared by the U.K.s competition regulator later that year.

“I haven’t always been optimistic every single day about the business climate in the U.K.,” Smith said. However, he added, “I am very encouraged by the steps that the government has taken over the last few years.”

“Just a few years ago, this kind of investment would have been inconceivable because of the regulatory climate then and because there just wasn’t the need or demand for this kind of large AI investment,” Smith said.

Starmer and Trump are expected to sign a new deal Wednesday “to unlock investment and collaboration in AI, Quantum, and Nuclear technologies,” the government said in a statement late Tuesday.

Yes, if you bought during or before 2021 you likely are still down. However, if you held your nose and bought when it was trading at dirt cheap prices during Feb 2024 you’re probably pretty happy right now.

The best time to buy is when everyone says “this is Uninvestable.” For example, I think stocks like MOH and CNC could have a lot of upside, maybe some REITs like ARE or MPW have value too. 

And yes, I am well aware of the VIE structure of the BABA ADR. It is certainly a risk, but all investing comes with risk, you just need to ensure that you’re well compensated for the risk you’re taking. If it scares you, consider FXI which owns shares on the Hong Kong exchange. Full disclosure I own that too, as well as TCEHY.

The program came out of a June executive order and sets up controlled trial environments under DOT and FAA oversight. Archer will work with airlines (United is already backing them) and cities to show that its Midnight aircraft can fly quietly, safely, and at scale.

CEO Adam Goldstein called it a *“landmark moment,”* while United’s CFO said flying taxis could reshape how people move through congested cities. The trials could start as early as next year, with data feeding into certification and future expansion.

ACHR has already had a wild run this year (up over 150% YoY), but this adds another layer of federal legitimacy. Analysts keep slapping buy ratings with $13 PTs, even after the stock’s volatility.

**The bigger question:**

- Are we seeing the real start of urban air mobility, or is this just another news-fueled pump before a long wait on certification?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

He'll be just in time to cast a crucial vote in this week's central bank policy meeting.

The Fed is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rate for the first time this year.

""Miran's confirmation is part of a larger effort by the president to pack the Fed with members who favor lower rates.""

""Miran told lawmakers during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee that he would act independently if confirmed, but he does not intend to resign from his current White House position as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.

Instead, he would opt to take a leave of absence from the White House to serve on the central bank and then return after his term is up.""

1nhxe5d,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 16:36:29,EchoStar (SATS) seems massively undervalued after the $17B SpaceX deal,"I look at EchoStar (SATS), and I see something very interesting. A big thing happened and I think many people do not see the real story. I think maybe the price is too low now.

So, this company had a very big problem. It had too much debt. Like a huge credit card bill that is hard to pay. But then, they sell something very valuable. They sell their invisible highways for phone signals, what people call spectrum. First, they sell some to AT&T for $23 billion. Then, they sell more to SpaceX, the Elon Musk company, for $17 billion. That is so much money. With this money, they can pay all the debt. The big problem is gone.

The deal with SpaceX is very special. EchoStar did not just get cash. They get $8.5 billion in cash, and also an $8.5 billion piece of the SpaceX company. So now, EchoStar owns a part of SpaceX. This is very exciting, because SpaceX is growing very fast with its Starlink internet from satellites.
So what is EchoStar company now? It is not the same company it was before. Before, they were trying to build a big new 5G phone network all by themselves. This was very risky and was costing so much money. Now, they stopped that plan. The company is now more simple. It is a company that just owns a few other businesses. It is much safer now.

Think of it like a box with different toys inside. What is in the box?

First, there is the TV business, with DISH and Sling. This part is getting smaller, but it still makes a lot of money, like a cash machine.

Second, the phone business, Boost Mobile. It is smaller now and will use towers from other companies. But it will have a special new power: it will use the Starlink satellites from SpaceX so customers can get signal even in the middle of nowhere.

Third, an internet business called Hughes. This part is very stable and sells internet to government and other big companies.

Fourth, the piece of SpaceX. This is the most exciting part. It is like having a ticket for a rocket ship that is already flying to the moon. SpaceX is worth so much money, maybe $400 billion or more.

And fifth, they still have more of those invisible phone highways left to sell! One big bank said this extra part could be worth almost $10 billion. They can sell this later to a company like Verizon and get even more cash.

So, I add up all these pieces. The TV business, the phone business, the internet business, the piece of SpaceX, and the extra highways they still own. When I add it all up, I think the company is worth about $32 billion. But if you look at the stock market, the price for the whole company is only about $22 billion. This is a very big difference. It means one share of the stock could be worth maybe $110, but today it is much cheaper.

The story is simple. The company had a big debt problem. They sold some things and now the problem is gone. Now they have no debt, they have businesses that make money, and they own a piece of one of the world's most exciting companies. But the stock price is still acting like the old company with the big problem. This is why I think it is very interesting.

He was able to build a strong nest egg to coast through retirement easily, even if he just kept it in lower-interest assets yielding 3-4% per annum.

As for me, I've began my investing journey around 3 years ago and adopted a relatively conservative approach. By this I mean I hold around

* 30% cash in high-yield accounts (3-4%)
* 20% in a retirement account (6%)
* roughly 50% in a mixture of ETFs, individual stocks and crypto. Breakdown would be:
   * 35% ETFs tracking S&P500
   * 13% individual stocks
   * 2% crypto

This entire breakdown is derived from my entire net worth, I'm debt-free and projecting retirement in my early 40s.

Now going back to my dad, we've had several conversations about stocks & investments over the years, many of which have raised strong questions from me over his investing style. Let me name a few to paint a better picture:

* He's taken a nearly $2-3 million dollar loan to invest into more stocks (paid back almost half the loan)
* Majority of his investments are individual stocks, many of which consists of penny/speculative stocks that have tanked -80% all the way to delisting.
   * Huge chunk in GoPro in 2015, still holding to today with massive losses and no plans to sell and reallocate
   * Another huge chunk in (actinium pharma), which tanked nearly 90% due to not receiving FDA approval
* Several huge investments in mutual funds with high management fees (1.5-2%) which are either loss-making and barely making meaningful returns.

I was able to get hold of his spreadsheet recently to properly review his financial situation and it's extremely alarming. From my analysis, he's holding:

* 70+ individual stocks, mostly losses
* 10+ mutual funds, mostly losses

Over the last 10 months, I've created and presented two separate presentations explaining the amount of risk he's taking. I've explained the urgency of trimming his portfolio massively and reallocating into a simple index funds / bonds and even blue-chip individual stocks instead of penny stocks.

However, he has massive sunk-cost fallacy and refuses to cut his positions. He wants to wait another 6 months despite having held some of these positions over a decade. This is despite me presenting the mathematical projections that he's almost guaranteed to continue incurring huge losses holding these duds over investing in safer assets.

Does anyone have advice? I'm appaled as to how bad the damage is and whether he'll be able to repay the loan given his age.

1nhof8h,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 11:07:46,"LENZ Therapeutics - A high risk, high reward biotech stock","Hello r/stocks I have a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is possibly easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read?” I was just like you when I first read that. Here is what I learned.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•Target population of the US is 128 million people

	•A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year

	•The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600

⸻

Company Financial Health: Good

	•Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•I am unable to determine if their creation of this drug is protected by some type of IP or patent

	•It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•Financial health could be pressured if they fail to scale in an economical way

	•Short Interest is 30% – it is irrelevant to my thesis on this product but something you should all be aware of

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is “subject to SEC approval” and would “save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”

“Did you ever hear the statement that, ‘China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!’” Trump said.

The wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.

“In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” the pair wrote.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.

Supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.

Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company into territory occupied only by Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple.

The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust ruling by a judge, whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year a district court ruled that the company held an illegal monopoly in search and related advertising.

But Judge Amit Mehta decided against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President Donald Trump congratulated the company and called it “a very good day.”

Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared to the 15% gain for the Nasdaq.

The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google’s IPO and a little more than 10 years after of the creation of Alphabet as a holding company, with Google its prime subsidiary. .

CEO Sundar Pichai was named CEO of Alphabet in 2019, replacing co-founder Larry Page. Pichai’s latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through while also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up helping Google land the recent favorable antitrust ruling. The company’s hopes of becoming a major AI player largely ride with Gemini, Google’s flagship suite of AI models.

1ngvvff,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 12:33:24,Why Par Technology Corp is a LT Buy.,"Hey Everyone,

I came across this company while reading a partnership letter of an asset management firm that allocates capital in various securities. Naturally, I was curious to learn more about it, and low and behold, it was severely undervalued with great underlying economics and management that has made decisions that have kept the company alive and is positioning itself for the future very well.

For background PAR started as a defense company and made its way into the food industry firstly offering hardware solutions, like POS items, and in the last seven years undergoing a rapid transformation into a more cloud based solutions within the food industry. The security is undervalued due to net losses in the last seven years, this is because of the rapid transformation of the company into a primary software solutions provider, which has included many acqustions to position the company to offer a unified experience from Point of sale, to payements, to commerce. Hence in recent years the company has under gone volitality from the market, yet is is important to not net loss has dramtically reduced from around 70 million in 2023 to just 5 million net loss in 24, this aligns with strong revenue growth, year over year. Management has proved that it can adapt with the moving times something that kills great companies like Kodak as a major example. (Or perhaps severely weaken their market share.) I am acknowledging that saying that profitability in the near future is speculation, but all trends point in that way. (I will attach a summary of financials below.)

The balance sheet is strong as well as assets fully outweigh liablities and the assets include the companies they acquired equating to the goodwill, and 200 million in cash as well.

They also have great business advantages, primarily the fact that companies face high switching costs once they integrate. This is more relevant than ever since PAR is offering unified experiences. This can somewhat be applied with pricing power as well.

The margin of safety is there, although it is rather hard to make predictions for growth, even conservatively, the margin of safety is quite large, i have bought at 44 a share.

1ngvaz4,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 12:11:45,Hennessy funds recommends these top 3 small caps to become GIANTS,"Josh Wein, a VP & key 5 star portfolio manager of Hennessy Funds, who manages 10 of the funds worth collectively 3B in AUM, recently mentioned that these 3 top small caps are his favorite to become giants.

**$ROOT insurance:**

ROOT insurance is an insurance company with a 1.5B market-cap that underwrites risk utilizing AI targeting safe drivers, which allows them to have less risk & better profit margins than their legacy peers. ROOT although small, has been beating legacy insurers on all metrics all around, including pricing, loss ratios, and a forward efficient tech stack. ROOT has recently partnered with the biggest names in auto including Toyota, Hyundai, CVNA, Experian, etc, which now sports 20+ major partners strong, and many more to come. Their partnership channel has been growing at 3x YoY, and you quickly realize why Josh thinks ROOT could end up being a giant one day.

**$COMP**

Compass is a tech forward real estate brokerage. the thesis is that if interest rates drop, that real estate volume will pick back up. Josh also sees similarities to Redfin where another company can come in to acquire compass for synergies. Their profit margins are higher than other brokers, due to the tech support that compass provides to their agents. Compass has 33,000+ agents.

**$WMK Weis Markets Inc**

Weis Markets operates a chain of supermarkets with over 200 stores. Currently has a 1.75B market cap. Currently runs at a 17.64 P/E. has steady growth in assets, revenue, and offers a dividend. The thought behind this, is buying Weis in thoughts of it becoming the next Walmart. Though, growth hasn't been strong enough to support the thesis.

are there any other small caps that you would suggest other than what Wein has recommended?",0,14,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngvaz4/hennessy_funds_recommends_these_top_3_small_caps/,new,Unknown,0.41

Money-wise it’s a bit of a mixed bag tbh. Revenues are in the billions € but profits are meh. They just finished buying Intelsat which could be a huge deal if they don’t mess up the integration.

A quick question: out of the Mag 7, which do you think have the largest and lowest downside potential in case AI does not turn out to be the goldmine many think/thought it could be?

There are increasing concerns around the current version of AI (LLMs) being limited and not able to reach AGI (see, for instance, Yann Lecun’s take on it), coupled with concerns around monetisation (or, at least, monetisation in a scale compatible with providing good returns on the huge capital being invested), hence my question.

I think Nvidia is the top loser in that scenario, and Tesla the least exposed. Not sure about the other ones.

Thank you!

1ngogkq,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 07:06:03,Stock buybacks--Why are they happening and what do they imply for regular investors?,"I just saw that companies are buying back their own stock at a record pace, and this activity represented 6 times the volume of households buying in the market in 2024.  This is mind-blowing, and I can see a few ways to take it.  Also, I might be missing the point or the info might be misleading.  For example, how did they count my money managed by Vanguard or whoever in my 401k?

1-It could mean that the companies think their own stocks are drastically undervalued, and that might imply that despite measures like P/E ratio sending us the signal that the market is overvalued, the people in the know see it differently.  However, counter-intuitively, the chart I found showed that buybacks were lowest in the 2008 crash and the covid drop.  Those are the times that the companies' management should have seen their stocks as undervalued.  Maybe they were too focused on survival at that point to find the cash for buybacks(?) 

2-It could imply that they are using the buyback strategy as a substitute for investing in the future of their companies.  Perhaps they are trying to get the price up to catch a bonus, to increase the value of their own holdings, or just to give shareholders good feelings about their management as they see the price go up.

3-It could imply that the managers of these companies see few opportunities for investment, and they are just 'circling the airport', waiting for opportunities to come along in the future.  Maybe this could mean that a crash is likely in the near future.

Am I correct to think that today's levels of buybacks are unprecedented?  What is driving them?  What do they imply that rational individual investors should do in response, if anything?",16,98,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngogkq/stock_buybackswhy_are_they_happening_and_what_do/,new,Unknown,0.63

1nfl6jr,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 21:47:41,My thoughts on PAR.,"Hey Everyone,

So i have been looking for undervalued securities, and often you find investement ideas in niche places, from value line, to barrons, to in my case a interview with a founder of a asset management firm. The founder brought up PAR, and naturally my curiosity spiked, i went to check out the company as of now. This is will be pretty unformal so please bare with. The company has been loosing money as of late, which has relativley been the main factor in poor investor sentiment, and the whole reason the company is so undervalued in the first place. They have been loosing money primarily, because they are agressivley trying to acquire market share. PAR is a technology company that offers solutions to food businesses out of while tropical cafe and arbys are customers. I like this business because i know there are naturally high switching costs, and pricing power is strong. They have collectivley acquired different businesses from payments to commerce to really provide a unified expeirience to customers. Management competency is pretty high, Savneet Singh is the CEO and is track record is respectable to say the least. And i since the current price is at the 52 week low, it seems foolish not to put a shitload in the business, i see a long term oppurtunity, conservative dcf calculations seem to predict 10 year share prices of 110 of course this will vary individual to indiviual. So yeah for me PAR is a strong strong buy.

I bought RDDT at IPO and have been holding, because I believed in the company, and still believe that it’s a well run company with a good strategy for growth/monetization.

However, the Trump administration is putting their hands all over corporate America, and almost every large corporation is following the White House’s bidding, because no one wants to be on the wrong side of a fight with the entire federal government. Anyone that goes against the President could be faced with lawsuits, loss of contracts, having mergers/acquisitions blocked, etc. Look at how many concessions Paramount had to give the White House before their merger could be approved!

After the Charlie Kirk assassination, the American right-wing is PISSED, and swearing vengeance against “the violent left.” High ranking officials, including the President himself, are promising to root out left wing ideas. They’ve already organized extremely fast to get people and organizations investigated, suspended, and fired - https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/us/politics/charlie-kirk-shooting-firings-celebration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare

Reddit is the highest profile left-leaning social media. Multiple high profile conservatives are already angry about the highly upvoted posts that are sympathetic to the killing. Just look at the most upvoted posts yesterday on any default sub.

I think it will only be a matter of time before this sentiment about Reddit reaches the White House, and they will force Reddit to adopt changes that are favorable to the administration, such as shutting down certain subreddits, overhauling the moderation strategy, or even demanding sensitive details about certain users. If Reddit abides, it could severely impact Reddit’s growth strategy as left-leaning users find other platforms. If Reddit refuses, the administration will pursue many options to punish Reddit, like tying it up in lawsuits or preventing other companies from doing business with Reddit.

Either way, this should significantly affect Reddit stock price.

Could I be wrong and then RDDT runs up some more? Of course, but I’m already up 450% and won’t lose any sleep from selling it.",0,31,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfj3ri/why_im_selling_rddt_even_though_i_think_it_has/,new,Company Discussion,0.31
1nfgpnp,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 18:19:53,Finally leaving Robinhood after a decade,"I was part of the original batch of users when Robinhood was first teased online. Back then zero commission trading was unheard of. As a 21 year old trying to buy Tesla, logging into Scotttrade and paying commissions every single time felt like a huge barrier. Robinhood completely changed that and honestly changed the whole industry for the better.

But the app today feels very different. It has turned into a so called “super app” that constantly pushes Gold, nags you to roll over retirement accounts, and adds features that feel more like gambling than investing. The contract trading section especially just seems predatory.

I stuck with Robinhood through everything. I was not even mad during the GameStop Citadel mess when trading was locked. I defended them and even made YouTube videos back in the day recommending Robinhood to beginners.

This morning I finally moved everything to Fidelity with an ACATS transfer. I also signed up for their 2 percent cash back credit card and will funnel the rewards into index funds. At this point it just feels like the smarter move for where I am now.

Not trying to convince anyone, but after nearly a decade it feels like closing a chapter. Maybe I just grew up.


Edit: Wow, I didn’t expect so many Robinhood fans to chime in. To be clear, I was a fan too! The app just doesn’t sit right with me anymore. I’m not doing anything fancy like options these days. I’m a pretty passive investor now, mainly just buying two companies through my brokerage since my other accounts are already handling the index fund side. Really appreciate all the perspectives though.

> Shares of Pfizer and Moderna fell on Friday after a report that Trump administration health officials plan to link Covid vaccines to the deaths of 25 children.  The report from the Washington Post said officials plan to include the claim in a presentation next week to a key vaccine panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That committee plays a critical role in determining vaccine access, as it reviews immunization data and makes recommendations on who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other duties. But the presentation to that panel is not final, the Post reported. “FDA and CDC staff routinely analyze VAERS and other safety monitoring data, and those reviews are being shared publicly through the established ACIP process,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement, referring to the panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. “Until that is shared publicly, any this should be considered pure speculation,” the spokesperson added.

> Pfizer’s stock fell more than 3% on Friday, while shares of Moderna dropped more than 7%. Novavax, which creates protein-based Covid shots, slid more than 4%. The report comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moves to change vaccine policy in the U.S. He has dropped Covid shot recommendations for healthy kids and pregnant women and set new limits on the approval of new jabs against the virus. In a statement, Moderna said the safety of its vaccine is “rigorously monitored” by the company, the FDA and regulators in more than 90 countries. Systems across the U.S., Australia, Canada and Europe have not identified “any new or undisclosed safety concerns in children or in pregnant women,” Moderna added.",933,166,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfg181/pfizer_moderna_shares_fall_on_report_that_trump/,new,Unknown,0.97

This question is worthy of a deeper dive to explain why I think why vaccine economics should not apply to CD388:

1. CD388 isn’t a vaccine! It **doesn’t depend on the immune system**, so what this means in practical terms is that **it will work** just as **well for people that have weakened immune systems**, like the elderly, cancer patients, or people with other diseases that suppress immune function, as it will for healthy people.
2. CD388 is **flu strain agnostic**, whereas vaccines need to be reformulated yearly in the hopes of matching the most active strains.  For folks with weakened immune systems and at high risk of complications from the flu, the seasonal uncertainty of protection from vaccines translates to risk, and this risk translates to lifestyle changes (like wearing a mask and staying home) that have a serious impact on quality of life.
3. **CD388 works pretty much right away**, whereas it generally takes a couple of weeks for healthy immune systems to build up immunity after exposure to a vaccine.  This means people most at risk will be able to be confident that they’re protected soon after receiving CD388 and will stay protected through the flu season.
4. The effect of **CD388 is additive to vaccines**!  In terms of protecting the most at-risk population, this means that vaccines and CD388 can be used together to maximize protection against disease.

The key point here is that if the effectiveness of CD388 demonstrated in Cidara's 5000+ person-strong phase 2b holds for their phase 3 trial, they will have a drug that, for the population for which the flu disease burden is highest (i.e., where there is higher risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death), is far more effective than available flu vaccines.   Not only more effective, but additive to current vaccines.  Vaccines alone don’t deliver this same benefit to this population and so don't have the same value – economic or otherwise.  That’s why the company believes that a mAb prophylaxis like Beyfortus, not a flu vaccine, is a better reference for CD388 pricing.

Although I only included this high risk population in my original TAM calculation, the fact that CD388 is pan-influenza and applicable to H5 (Bird flu) strains, and that it works near-instantly, makes it an obvious candidate as a medical countermeasure for pandemic preparedness.   There is no doubt that stockpiling at scale for the masses would drive a different pricing regime, consistent with the volumes that can be expected for such stockpiles.  I excluded this “icing on the cake” from my previous analysis, however, simply because the numbers just leave me shaking my head in disbelief! I’ll leave that analysis for when and if BARDA gives us a hint of what that stockpiling might be worth.

Bottom line, I am still looking for the definitive answer to my original question: Is Cidara's CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market?  Some of the feedback I’ve received suggest that its current discount reflects its development stage, but my valuation math already considers a measured probability of success (or failure).   Does a 60%-80% discount on top of my already risk-managed rNPV really make sense?

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

It had a surge yesterday and is now sitting at $310, still down from its ath of $545. This upward movement came from 2 analysts increasing their price target to $400.

It had a similar spike back on August 18th when it increased to $370, which was then followed by a large sell off down to $270. Same reason, an analyst made an upgrade.

Being that its still in a bearish trend, I view this spike in share price as a good time to buy puts, curious what yall think?

I think it will continue down the rest of this month, but may rally leading up to earnings.

1nev4bo,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 01:42:12,NASDAQ wants to tokenize stocks… are they just late to the party?,"When Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs finally got approved, it felt like TradFi was pulling crypto into its world.
But with Nasdaq now asking the SEC to allow trading tokenized stocks, the roles might be reversing: traditional finance is moving into blockchain territory.

What stands out is that tokenization isn’t new.

Crypto platforms have already been experimenting with RWA products for a while  from tokenized bonds to futures tied to stocks like TSLA or NVDA.

These products weren’t perfect, but they proved the concept and attracted real user demand.


Now, Nasdaq itself wants in, asking regulators to approve rule changes so tokenized stocks can trade alongside traditional ones, under the same conditions. That’s a massive shift in narrative: Wall Street isn’t just watching RWA anymore, it wants to own it.

So here’s the open question:

If Wall Street starts pushing tokenized equities and bonds, will crypto platforms that pioneered these products (like Bitget with its RWA index futures) still have an edge?

Or will the traditional markets simply absorb the idea and leave Web3 players behind?

1nes68a,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 22:57:35,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don’t make money, they burn money, so it’s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it’s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it’s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm’s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it’s going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won’t be pretty. The warning signs are already showing.

I'll prove it.","**TL;DR: I believe $BYRN will pop off on or before their earnings call on October 8th.** Shorts are trying to convince you that a company with 57% revenue growth and frankly explosive profits is a bad bet. They are wrong.


    Standard play: $BYRN shares currently $19-20;
    
    Budget play 1: 10/17 25c currently ~$0.65;
    
    Budget play 2: 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80. 


\---------------------------------------------------

In 2023, I started value investing again. Responsibly. Just a bit. And long story short, I found BYRN. I've been holding it since it was $4. After their 2025 first quarter earnings, they spiked to around $34, where I took profits. But then the stock sank. And sank some more. For no reason. So I bought back. And so should you.

Disclaimer: I couldn't post this in WSB because BYRN is at $475mm market cap and doesn't meet the $500mm minimum requirement. Hopefully tomorrow I can post there too.

- *Quick rundown of Byrna.  It's a nonlethal gun (""launcher"") company that gained attention after Google banned them from advertising on their platforms in 2023 for promoting violence. Ironic. Police departments worldwide are using it now, and the Streisand effect is gaining them more and more contracts. Their CMRO is genuinely goated, most recently securing a deal with Sportsman's Warehouse to have in-store Byrna demo rooms. It's been a massive success, as you'll see below. They have*  ***zero debt and positive income***.

---

Seriously though, there's like literally no reason it's being suppressed at $20. I have reason to believe there's some bullshittery happening here. Here I shall present to you my thesis on their October 8th earnings call. Fun fact, I typed this entire thing myself. No AI.

So you're doubtful? Nah bruh. LOOK at the

###Fundamentals:

**Tariff resistance stats:** 100% ammo production in the USA. 92% launcher production in the USA.

**Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $26.2 million (57% increase from $16.7 million)
    Gross Profit: $15.9 million (61% of revenue)
    Net Income: $1.7 million (9900% increase from $17,000)

**Q2 2025 vs. Q2 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $28.5 million (41% increase from $20.3 million)
    Gross Profit: $17.6 million (62% of revenue)
    Net Income: $2.4 million (14% increase from $2.1 million)


**Q3 2025 vs. Q3 2024 (Preliminary)**:

    Net Revenue: $28.2 million (35% increase from $20.9 million)
     - Driven by a 147% increase in chain store and dealer channels (wtf)
    Web sales increased by 8%.
    International sales grew by 33%.

Like please. In one of the most turbulent economic chapters in US history, BYRN is STILL ramping its sales and margins. And yet, the stock is hovering around $20. My best guess is, your average retail investor isn't who is shorting it. It's someone else. Possibly a hedge fund, because 66% of BYRN is owned by institutional investors who don't give enough of a shit to short it.

I've been tracking this stock for 2 years now. People are catching on. Remember, these guys were trading at $4 in 2023. Every single one of their C level execs is amazing. Analyst price targets are between $35 and $46. The company is officially profitable, and income is consistently in the black. But the stock is marooned at $20. I couldn't make sense of it, because I don't like conspiracy theories. But it kept happening. For MONTHS.

###The Short ""Interest""

Yeah, we're a bit allergic to the term ""shorts"" these days. I get it. But... I have to call it out. Because as of August 15th, the short interest on BYRN was 4.08 million shares, or 23.1% of the total float. ***Nearly a quarter of the company’s publicly traded shares are being shorted.***

##***23.1% short interest on a profitable, zero debt company.*** WHAT.

> **They use AI in their marketing...**

- The target market for the AI ads are boomers who shop at Sportsman’s Warehouse. They can’t tell the difference between AI and a real video, and they don’t care. I literally sent my parents the video and asked them what was wrong with it. My mom said ""it was a wonderful ad, very clever"". Bullish.

> **The economy is uncertain...**

- BYRN is nearly immune to tariffs. See Tariff Resist Stats above. The fact that the stock moves on tariff news is honestly dumb as heck, but we live in the world of algos now. Bullish, but also I'm a bit pissed about this.

> **They're burning cash...**

- Yep. New product release (Byrna CL), they're burning cash to stockpile and advertise it. And they're still in the black. AND it’s working. Gotta spend money to make money. Bullish.


The preliminary earnings for Q3 are already out, and they are fantastic. The only thing left to be revealed in October is the EPS, and I’m betting 30k shares that it’s going to be another profitable quarter.

Why am I writing this all out? Because I want someone else other than me to be interested in this. BYRN is an obviously overlooked company. I rode the wave from $4 without saying a word and waiting for talking heads from Yahoo.com to spread the news. But lately I've been thinking, there's a big value play here, and it's happening because somebody with a lot of money somewhere made a mistake and needs time to unload. I'm expecting it to run up to somewhere from $35-$45. Am I crazy? Can someone stop me because I want to throw 100% of my portfolio into this baddie. I'm actually simping for this company so hard its crazy.

###Plays to take advantage of this (I did all 3):

1. 10/17 25c currently ~$0.60-$0.90

2. Buy the stock. Currently hovering between $19-$21

3. 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80 (less risky play)

**$SOUN** provides voice enabled platforms for cars, restaurants, and customer support. They sell voice solutions to businesses. It’s still early stage and not fully profitable, but the growth potential is there.

**$OPEN** is a tech driven home buying and selling company. They give homeowners instant cash offers, flip houses, and offer extra services like title and escrow. Their revenue swings a lot with housing market cycles and management moves.

**$RR** makes service robots for hospitality, restaurants, warehouses, and cleaning. Some robots handle drinks, deliveries, or cleaning, basically taking over repetitive human tasks. Deployment is growing, but profitability is still in the early stages.

All three companies are using technology or systems to replace or streamline traditional processes. None of them are rock solid profitable yet, so stock swings can be wild. News, market sentiment, or sector trends can make big moves in either direction. Their solutions have large potential markets. Voice platforms can be scaled across industries, Opendoor targets the massive US housing market, and RR’s robots can be applied wherever service humans are needed.

Of course, there are risks, costs are high (development, deployment, maintenance), market adoption isn’t guaranteed, competition is fierce, and management/operational risks exist (e.g., OPEN had CEO changes recently).

So, yeah, they're not the same companies, but they are all future, AI + automation or robotics. Could be fun to watch if you'd like speculative trades,  but don't be fooled, they are not low risk.

In Robinhood, I’d probably just hold VTI because they do not have VTSAX, and I feel like one huge advantage to this is being able to buy IPOs when they release, as they seem to be constantly doubling these days. Also, Robinhood makes it significantly easier to sell and buy shares of stock.

I’ve been digging into Cidara ($CDTX), which is developing CD388, a once-per-season prophylaxis for influenza. Essentially a “universal flu med” for high-risk groups (elderly, immunocompromised, diabetics) where vaccines don't work well. It recently came out of a large phase 2b trial with ""game-changer"" efficacy results and will soon be moving on to phase 3.

Share price today: ~$63/share × ~42M FD shares (fully diluted) = ~$2.7B valuation.

Note: It perked up a bit today (and promptly settled back down), I suspect because the company mentioned yesterday to investors at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference that they were very happy with how their end of phase 2b meeting with the FDA in August went. Also, their phase 3, which was supposed to start in the spring 2026, is now posted on clinicaltrials.gov as starting this fall. No official PR from Cidara yet, but it seems some good news is coming.

Anyway, here's my math on valuation (conservative inputs):

TAM for CD388: ~285M high-risk in WHO high-income countries (CDC/WHO data, overlap-adjusted). I am extrapolating from the company's US-only data because it seems silly to think a universal flu drug that works well and is safe will only sell in the US.

Pricing: Anchored to long-acting prophylactics (like Beyfortus RSV mAb), not cheap antivirals. U.S. ~$495/dose, ex-U.S. ~$225 → ~$280 weighted avg. (company has done market research and projects confidence that payers will cover at these price points. The ex. US assumption is my own, but follows typical patters of 50% reduction outside US).

COGS: ~$70/dose (figure mentioned by CFO in recent presentation, better as they scale production) → ~75% gross margin. Net margin assumed at 25% (in line with biologics).

Uptake: 25% peak (~71M treated). For context: flu vaccine coverage = ~45% of U.S. adults, ~70% of seniors. So 25% feels skeptical, not aggressive. I more realistic number would be to match vaccine uptake in this high-risk population, but I'm trying to keep this conservative.

Valuation (rNPV): Launch 2028 (potential timing for approval also mentioned by CEO in above conference), patent to 2039, biosimilar erosion by 2042. Discount 10%, PoS 75%. Outcome = ~$22B NPV → $445–530/share!

That's a big number for a clinical stage biotech, but this is a universal flu play! And Cidara is also a platform play with an oncology med based on the same DFC platform waiting in the wings, so maybe it should at least get some optionality out of that.

So my question: why the disconnect?

Is it just “clinical-stage biotech = high risk” until Phase 3 reads out?

Are institutions deliberately keeping this quiet until they’re positioned? (huge institutional interest vs. small free retail float)

Is the market over-discounting dilution, competition, or BARDA uncertainty?

From where I sit, the numbers look like 7–8× upside, but the stock sits flat at $62-$64.

Curious to hear from this community: what am I missing? Why does the market price CD388 so conservatively when even cautious rNPV with risk levers turned up points so much higher?

**For discussion only. This is a question, and not investment advice! I hold shares of $CDTX.**

1ndkcue,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 13:18:00,WeRide – Quietly Crushing the Autonomous Driving Game,"Alright, let’s talk about a ticker nobody’s giving enough love: WeRide ($WRD).

Yeah, their earnings were 2 months ago, but sometimes you gotta let the hype die down and actually look at the numbers. And holy hell, these guys are quietly building one of the strongest plays in autonomous driving.

Q2 ‘25 Recap:

* Total revenue hit $17.8M, up 60% YoY.
* Robotaxi revenue exploded +836% YoY to $6.4M. That’s now over a third of their total business – it’s not a “pilot program” anymore, it’s a legit revenue driver.
* Gross profit climbed 40% YoY, with gross margin sitting pretty at 28%. Scaling AND getting more efficient. Most of their competitors can’t say that.
* They dropped HPC 3.0, running on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor. This isn’t just marketing fluff – it cuts system cost in half while keeping it fully automotive-grade. Lower costs + better scalability = every fleet rollout becomes more profitable.
* Market Cap still only 2.7 Billion - potential 10x in coming years

Global footprint (bigger than most people realize):

* Abu Dhabi: robotaxi fleet tripled since Dec ‘24. Over 2,200 days of safe ops – regulators love that.
* Saudi Arabia: first company to run robotaxis in Riyadh. Major flex in the Middle East.
* Singapur: First operating autonomous vehicle without a safety driver in South-East Asia
* Permits in 6 countries.
* Uber and Grab partnership: the real kicker. WeRide’s tech is getting plugged into Uber’s and Grab's ecosystems, with plans for 15 cities outside US/China in the next 5 years. Uber also tossed in a $100M investment.

People sleep on this – WeRide isn’t just pushing one product. They’ve got:

* Robotaxis (obviously)
* Robobusses
* Robovans (autonomous logistics/delivery)
* Robosweepers (city sanitation, already deployed)
* Other mobility/transport solutions, all running on the WeRide One Platform.

That means multiple revenue streams across mobility + logistics + smart city services. They’re building an ecosystem.

Look, the stock isn’t mooning *yet*. They’re still in growth mode, and yes, net income is red. But think about it: massive YoY growth, global ops scaling, partnerships with Uber, Grab, Lenovo and NVIDIA, and a diversified portfolio. Compare that to the other AV players stuck in testing loops or bleeding cash without a clear roadmap.

This is how a long game looks – grab market share, get permits, build trust with regulators, diversify products, line up big-name partners, and then ride the revenue curve.

TL;DR  
2 months after earnings and I’m still hyped:

* Revenue up 60%, robotaxi rev up 836%.
* NVIDIA-powered HPC 3.0 = cheaper, faster scaling.
* Global expansion (Abu Dhabi, Saudi, Singapur, 6 permits worldwide).
* Uber deal with $100M backing.
* Broad product lineup beyond taxis.

I’m not saying it’s going 10x overnight, but this smells like a sleeper growth stock that’ll sneak up on everyone. While the herd chases Tesla and Waymo FSD headlines, WeRide is quietly racking up cities, fleets, and partnerships.",30,15,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndkcue/weride_quietly_crushing_the_autonomous_driving/,new,Company Analysis,0.78

I first bought Broadcom more than a year ago for $150, and added more yesterday around $340, deciding to take the plunge after holding on and realizing that the price wouldn’t come down.

Broadcom (AVGO) the second largest AI chipmaker, and the leader by far in custom GPUs, and datacenter networking gear declared July quarter results that just passed estimates by a whisker.

The stock, however, rallied massively the next day as the ebullient CEO, Hock Tan talked up a massive $110Bn backlog , a new $10Bn customer and an expanding TAM for custom silicon and datacenter networking.

**The quarterly results and guidance at a glance**

* Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.69 beat by $0.03.
* Revenue of $15.95Bn (+22.0% YoY) beat by $130Mn. Broadcom’s revenue growth rest on two pillars, AI 32% and VMware 36% of sales, so an overall 22% growth is  excellent for the company.
* Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7Bn, with a 67% margin.
* A massive cash haul of 7.2Bn less Capex of just $142Mn, gave it an FCF of $7 Bn or 44% of revenue – **Very impressive.**

**Guidance was also close to estimates on supply constraints.**

The good stuff came during the earnings call, which was much more illuminating; CEO Hock Tan was very enthused about AI prospects, and talked about sufficiently faster growth and a massive backlog of $110Bn, plus he confirmed adding a new customer, rumored to be OpenAI.

This is one company and CEO, I respect tremendously. Hock Tan whose tenure was extended to 2030 by the board always talks up a big game; more importantly he delivers like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Arista Networks', Jayshree Ullal. 

**From Broadcom’s Q3 Earnings call:**

>

**Broadcom’s strengths and positive catalysts**

**AI revenue share keeps rising:** The share of AI revenue has gone up to an estimated 32-33% of FY2025 sales from 24% last year and based on management’s confidence in Ethernet and custom silicon scale ups and scale outs it should grow to $34Bn in FY2026, or 43% of sales and $56Bn in FY2027 or 61% of total sales. Broadcom’s sales and earnings multiples expand with each percentage increase of AI in the total mix.

**Ethernet can increase market share:** Management believes that hyperscalers prefer Ethernet “as one single fabric for both scale-out and scale-up,” and Broadcom’s Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers, and NICs can continue to grow and gain datacenter connectivity share over competitors like Nvidia, Arista Networks and Marvell.

**High margin SaaS continues to grow:** VMware continues to be a pillar of strength, with 17% high margin revenue growth. Besides, Broadcom is positioning VMware as an integrated AI solution with custom silicon.

**Strong margins:** Broadcom has strong 37% adjusted operating and 44% operating cash flow margins.

**Increasing TAM:** Previously, management had indicated that FY2026 AI revenue growth might be similar to FY2025 (roughly +50–60% YoY). But now, with the addition of a fourth hyperscaler, Broadcom’s 2026’s AI growth to “accelerate” beyond that rate, likely between 60 and 70%. The new $10Bn+ XPU customer has moved to production for AI server racks with shipments scheduled to begin in Q3 FY2026. This deal suggests several million custom AI chips could be delivered, aimed at AI inference workloads, which is the next big frontier as it takes over from training, and cements Broadcom as one of the biggest and preferred inference players.  Inference requires significantly more tokenization than training, which means hyperscalers will have to continue investing, to continue getting higher throughput at lower costs, which is key to Broadcom’s success. The $110Bn backlog that Tan spoke of confirms that this demand is much higher than anticipated.

**Broadcom’s biggest challenge is valuation, 20x FY2026 sales growing at 22%, leaves it with little room for error. It is priced to perfection.**",32,8,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndeclp/broadcom_cements_its_ai_credentials/,new,Company Discussion,0.85

Basically what the title says. I looked at the fundamentals which I personally like.
ROE > 27%
ROIC > 19%
Gross margin > 30%
PE = 20
Forward PE = 18

It has growing numbers on top and bottom line. Its Free cash flow is increasing YoY. It has more cash than debt.

Only negative part IMO is that the growth projections are in the single digits, so it's not a high growth company.

On the other hand, it's current pull backs from its 2024 highs is quite significant. It sits where it was around 5 years ago where it is sitting on a rather strong support.

So all in all, ACN might be a company to keep an eye on.

What do you guys think of it?

1nd8ojp,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 04:33:18,Investing in (the rise of retail) investing?,"Hello again!

Three months ago I made a reddit thread about Investing in Escapism. I took my observations as a gen Z living in SEA and I had good discussions in the previous thread with people sharing their experience and what industries/stocks might benefit from escapism.

My initial bets were: Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (700), and Meta. They're all doing well and I even added RDDT into my portfolio due to that thread, it's up over 100% now (sadly I haven't bought much of it yet).

I was still exploring into industries like BNPL which are really popular in poorer SEA countries (in Thailand where I live, the government warns that people are using BNPL to pay for food and groceries), and traveling (one redditor raised traveling as another thing to look out for, and from my observation it seems most Gen Z's seem to travel a lot, I see people taking a trip to Japan. I even plan one myself later this year). I ruled out Gaming and Alcoholism. (There was RBLX mentioned too, and it's been doing well this year)  
  
While I was thinking about Escapism, It hit me that I, too, am one of the target demographic. There is a raising trend about Gen Z who take their finances much more seriously than previous generations. Crypto, trading, stocks are becoming common words. I started investing back when I was 22-23, now I'm 28 and it's changed my life trajectory massively. There are probably many who are also doing this. a gen Z investor/customer will mean a lifetime of commission/fees if a service can make them stick long term.

I'm not familiar with all the financial service or other non-stock space. My initial thought is obviously my broker: IBKR. I've been using their service since 2021 and I'm very happy with them. They have lower fees and global reach for both markets and clients. The financial knowledge in the US is likely the highest of the world, all the cheapest index funds and competitive brokerages are over there. I think the rest of the world will slowly catch up, which could mean positive outlook for IBKR who's positioned to benefit the most from the rise of retail investing (outside of maybe S&P 500 itself due to all the money flowing over there). Coinbase is another that comes to my mind but I haven't looked into it.

I want to hear your thoughts. Which stocks or industries do you think will directly or indirectly benefit the most from the rise of retail investing? 

Thank you again for reading!

NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices settled higher on Tuesday after the Israeli military said it carried out an attack on Hamas leadership in the Qatari capital Doha, an expansion of its military actions in the Middle East.

Brent crude futures settled 37 cents, or 0.6%, higher at $66.39 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures also climbed 37 cents, or 0.6%, to close at $62.63 a barrel.

Both benchmarks had gained almost 2% shortly after the Israeli attack on Qatar, but gave up the majority of those gains later as the United States assured Doha that such a thing would not happen again on its soil.

""Both the U.S. and Qatar have made it clear they are not seeking further escalation, while the muted reaction from other (Gulf Cooperation Council) members reinforces the view that the risk of a wider regional flare-up remains contained,"" said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.""

For now, geopolitical risk premiums are easing rather than building,"" Leon said.

Oil prices also pared some gains because the attack did not create any immediate supply disruption, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.

The oil benchmarks were trading higher prior to the attack on Qatar, supported by the latest oil output increase from OPEC+ being smaller than anticipated, expectations that China will continue stockpiling oil and concerns over potential new sanctions against Russia.",28,1,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nd7rzv/oil_settles_higher_after_israeli_attack_on_qatar/,new,Industry News,0.86

1nd1djr,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 21:37:26,Nebius Moves To The Big Leagues,"**The $17.4Bn to $19.4Bn Nebius - Microsoft Deal**

NBIS ($96)

**This is a tremendous deal for Nebius.**

My investment thesis for Nebius was based on its technical/engineering strengths as a medium sized Neocloud provider democratizing AI infrastructure for medium sized businesses who did not want or need to pay exorbitant fees to AWS or the other hyperscalers. Prior to this deal, its biggest customer was Shopify and it was well on its way to expanding its reach to companies at, or below Shopify’s size.

**Nebius' competitive advantages:** Its biggest strengths lie in its full software stack, honed by decades of engineering talent from the ex Yandex team, instead of being a brute provider of GPU‘s in scale like Coreweave, which meant that it had the competitive advantage of not being sucked into lower pricing from just renting out GPUs. It could command a higher price and margin than other Neocloud providers, by focusing more on providing a platform and a superior stack of solutions, plus its customers were supposed to be smaller, giving it more bargaining power. Its second competitive advantage is its strategic relationship with Nvidia, which allows it to commit and guarantee computing power, the way it did with Microsoft. It has the GPUs and the datacenter infrastructure to ensure that there are no supply constraints or bottlenecks.

**Excellent Return On Investment**: Prior to this deal, its estimated sales growth was $0.6Bn in 2025, growing to $9Bn by 2030, and my target was 8X sales or a market cap of $72Bn, which was about 5x the market cap of $15Bn it was selling at till yesterday - so an almost 5x return over 5 years or 37% per year. **Pretty hefty.**

**Even better ROI:** A deal of $18Bn at mid-point clearly changes these estimates and I’m conservatively forecasting the six year deal adds at least $2Bn to revenue each year. And of course, they will get growth from other clients, a massive deal like this gives them even more cachet - my revised sales target for 2030 is $13.5Bn, valuing Nebius at 10x sales = $135Bn. CEO, Arkady Volozh calls this just the beginning, and so far he has walked the talk. At $135Bn we could be looking at almost 7x the current market cap of $22.6Bn (at a price of$95), or a return of 42% per year.

**Need to raise capital:** They will need to raise at least $3-5Bn in the next 2-3 years from both debt and equity, to play in the majors, but what’s also amazing is that they are financing this with Microsoft’s cash and credit, which means the dilution/interest payments will not be that high. Nebius still comes out way ahead with another 30% increase in share count, if needed at this price. Coreweave has $7.5 billion in long-term debt with about $7 billion in sales in 2025 with around $30 billion worth of contracts, and their growth trajectory confirms that capital raises are absolutely necessary for Neoclouds to thrive. 

**Adding more shares:** I was very content to hold and even sold off some in the mid-sixties after getting 2.6x my purchase price of $23, but now I think the stock is still worth buying even though it has shot up 45% in a day, considering where this company could go in the next five years. This deal actually validates my original thesis and I have no qualms about pyramiding (adding smaller quantities) to my holding.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.47 adjusted vs. $1.48 expected
* **Revenue:** $14.93 billion vs. $15.04 billion expected

Revenue increased 12% from a year earlier during the quarter, which ended on Aug. 31, according to a statement. Net income was about flat at $2.93 billion, or $1.01 per share, compared to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Oracle said its remaining performance obligation, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been contracted, now stands at $455 billion, up some 359% from a year earlier. During the quarter OpenAI said it signed an agreement with Oracle to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity.

Alongside larger cloud providers such as Microsoft, Oracle has been one of the big winners of the AI boom, due to its cloud infrastructure business and its access to Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) needed for large workloads. CEO Safra Catz said in the statement that the company signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the quarter.

Also in the quarter, Oracle said cloud rival Google’s Gemini artificial intelligence models would become available on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure.

Oracle shares hit a record last month and are up 45% in 2025 as of Tuesday’s close, while the S&P 500 index has gained 11%.

But after hearing a bunch of buddies in my trading discord go on and on about them, I got curious.

Recently, I noticed series of majors DP trades significantly below the market price for one of the stocks I follow. Over the course of the next hourr, price moved sharply up as if the public price was being ""pushed"" away from the dark pools. .I know that that sounds absurd, but that's exactly what the pattern looks like and it seems to happen regularly. If large dark pool activity happens far away from the publick price (like outside the bolligner bands) then the DPs seem to act as a repellent the and price moves away from them.

Position: 15,000 shares at $18.20

Sarepta stock is down almost 90% due to two deaths related to its flagship gene therapy, Elevidys. It’s an expensive but highly unique solution to give children suffering from DMD a chance at a better life. 

They got in a pissing match with an FDA official, and long story short, it’s still ongoing but in a detente. They have huge political support, as well as support from families of the kids suffering from this. The FDA pulled their therapy, yet shortly after, put it back on the market. 

There is no other solution for kids suffering from DMD, and nothing in the near or medium term either. If they can continue to keep their drug on the market and if they’re allowed to sell it to non-ambulatory patients again (perhaps in conjunction with some liver-protecting drugs) the stock could potentially go back to triple digits. However, there is also a chance that it goes to $0 if their drug is permanently pulled for everyone (small chance, but not zero).",6,11,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nclmnh/srpt_binary_outcome/,new,Unknown,0.64
1ncj0ng,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 09:31:48,"Why are all EVTOLs posts focusing on Joby/Archer, while EH seems at least as promising, if not better ?","Every week there are new threads on this sub trying to pump Archer, and occasionally Joby, but I feel like the discourse here completely overlooks EHang, which is to me a much safer bet for the following reasons 


**1. First to Market, first to revenue**

While Joby and Archer are still in the FAA certification process, EHang has already achieved its equivalent in China. They hold the Type Certificate, Production Certificate, and a standard Airworthiness Certificate from the CAAC for their EH216-S model. It has allowed them to be the first in the world to launch commercial, passenger-carrying eVTOL operations. EHang has a full year of revenue-generating flights under its belt and what appears to be a growing order book. Joby and Archer, for all their progress, are still effectively pre-revenue companies on the passenger side. To me, this is a considerable edge over them, as they actually have something on the market now. 

**2. A much more favourable environment**

EHang operates in a region that is actively championing the growth of the ""low-altitude economy."" The Chinese government and various local municipalities are partnering with EHang, providing financial support and, most importantly, a clear and streamlined regulatory pathway. This contrasts sharply with the challenges in the United States and Europe, where there are way more regulatory roadblock, NIMBY sentiments, and a general mindset that is more cautious towards new technologies. 

In my opinion, this is crucial, as if you really think about it, the current certifications hurdles are just the start for Western companies, as building the infrastructure for EVTOLs will definitely be met with a lot of resistance, flight routes will be considered a disturbance for the locals and will struggle to receive approvals, and the development might be extremely slowed down because of it, independently of the actual viability of the vehicles.

**3. A more pragmatic approach**

Personally, I think EHang’s strategy of starting with a simpler, two-seater, autonomous vehicle has paid off quite well. It allowed them to achieve certification and commercialization far earlier. A key point for me is that their platform was designed to be autonomous from day one, which I believe is the ultimate endgame for this industry in terms of operational efficiency and scalability. It also gives credibility to their ambitions when it comes to longer range vehicles. 

Their VT-35 will be able to fly 300km, and is already well into its certification process with the CAAC. They have a partnership with the city of Hefei to establish a comprehensive product hub for the VT-35, involving a joint investment of approximately 1 billion RMB, covering R&D, testing, manufacturing, and the entire certification process, significantly accelerating the model's industrialization.

They're also making variants of their EH216 model for other applications such as logistics and firefighting. 

**4. Tangible growth and expansion**

It's also clear that EHang's ambitions are not confined to its domestic market. Over the past year, they've solidified partnerships in the UAE, Southeast Asia, and parts of Europe, moving from demonstration flights to laying the groundwork for international sales and operations. This suggests a clear and aggressive growth strategy.

**5. The massive valuation disconnect**

EHang's market cap is hovering around $1 billion. Compare that to Archer at ~$5.5 billion and Joby at ~$11.5 billion.

To me, there is a massive valuation gap. It looks to me like the market is pricing Joby and Archer for near-perfect future execution, while seemingly discounting EHang's very real, present-day achievements. It makes the risk/reward much more attractive ofr EH.

**Conclusion: A safer bet on a very speculative sector**

As I see it, investing in Joby and Archer rely on a lot of uncertain event to go rights, starting from the certification, to the viability of the mass production, whether the piloted model can be viable or not (it's not an uber, you won't get away with paying pilots peanuts, so this makes the commercial viability more challenging as costs will be higher), the need to manage the roadblocks to the required infrastructure development, NIMBY blocking flight routes, safety concerns of the customers, etc. EVTOLs might succeed, but it's definitely a tough road ahead.

With EHang, I feel like you're investing in a company that has already proven its model. They have a certified product, established manufacturing, growing revenue, and a supportive domestic market. When factoring in that you're getting all this for a fraction of its competitors market caps, I find it hard to justify picking them over EH at the moment.

To be honest, I'm sure a lot of people will react with the usual ""China is uninvestable"" discourse, but I feel like it makes very little sense in this case, as the usual risks associated with Chinese stocks are very minor compared to the huge risk that such speculative investments represent in the first place. Even if you want to discount the stock a bit for it, it should at least be in the conversation when discussing EVTOLs companies.

This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Murdoch’s $3.3 Billion Succession Deal Hands Lachlan Control](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-08/murdoch-family-settles-suit-over-trust-puts-lachlan-in-charge?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**NBIS (Nebius)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NBIS&p=d)\- Nebius said it signed a multibillion‑dollar agreement to provide Microsoft with artificial intelligence infrastructure. Ultimately spiked up to $110 yesterday and made a MASSIVE move afterhours, I'm primarily interested in seeing if we can continue that today. Watching $100 level. The Neocloud providers like Nebius (and CoreWeave) are benefiting from AI compute demand, and big tech is signaling that the AI party is continuing for now, overall a bullish sign for compute companies.

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d) **/** [**FIGR (Figure)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FIGR&p=d)\- FIGR IPO has been upsized, so CRCL has reacted positively to the news, I'm currently watching both leading up to the IPO of FIGR. Does this have as much potential as CRCL? I'd say no, but I think that it is an interesting watch. The surge of crypto‑industry IPOs sparked by Circle’s $1.05 B listing has been part of the IPO market coming back. FIGR is aiming for an IPO that is half its size, and is decently profitable. Planning to write a DD on this. Main risk in this is that we get absolutely euphoric (we're already very euphoric in the IPO market lol).

[**FOX (Fox Corp)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FOX&p=d)\- Lachlan Murdoch has won the game of Succession and the stock has drifted somewhat lower on this news-but it was done on such little volume we’ll have to wait until the market opens to see if FOX will stay down 5%.

[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)\- Day 2 of being added (or at least, notifying everyone it will be added) to the S&P 500! primarily interested in if it can continue the momentum and break ATH (\~$117/\~117.70).

1ncf2fd,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 06:19:34,"Share that one stock that everybody seems to hate, but you like","To me, it is $SNAP

Everybody is saying the same things about it. The CEO sucks, they have flopped many products, they can't monetize in the way that other social media giants can. But the reason I believe it's a good purchase: It’s survived wave after wave of “this app is dead” & still the userbase is growing year after year.

Snapchat is growing year-over-year, with a 7% increase in global monthly active users (MAU) to 932 million and a 9% increase in daily active users (DAU) to 469 million in Q2 2025.

This makes it very interesting for acquisitions by e.g. Meta or Google - or simply a complete overhaul of the monetization done by money hungry consultancy firms such as Mckinsey or Deloitte.

Besides, they currently already have increased profit quarter after quarter. They could even keep improving with the current set-up.

And the cherry on top: it's currently trading at an all time low.

It has the potential to grow slowly in the current states, but it could also increase exponentially with exciting developments in the future.

Should you allocate 50% of your portfolio? No. But a small position can't hurt, in my opinion.

1ncdql0,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 04:54:59,Thoughts on SpaceX's acquisition of Echostar,"In the realm of satellite communications, the most critical and scarce resource is frequency; orbital resources, by contrast, are abundant.

Among the foreign D2C satellite constellations, the only one that can truly compete with Starlink is ASTS, which is backed by numerous telecommunications operators. The others are merely dabbling.

ASTS has three relative advantages.

First, it has a large number of partner operators. Once its satellite network is complete, its services can be rolled out faster and more broadly.

Second, it has more frequency resources. Currently, most mobile communication frequencies are held by operators. With more partners, ASTS clearly has an advantage in this area. On a lighter note, ASTS once tested on a frequency band partially allocated to amateur radio enthusiasts, which drew protests from the amateur community. ASTS claimed their tests proved there would be no negative impact on others, but the FCC didn't buy their story and swiftly issued a clear order prohibiting ASTS from using that band.

Third, its satellites are more advanced, boasting the world's largest satellite communications array (223 square meters).

However, Starlink has now aggressively secured the AWS-4 and PCS H-Block frequency bands with its financial power, significantly diminishing ASTS's frequency advantage.

On the other hand, ASTS is facing delays in its network deployment. Only five BlueBird-1 satellites (the first generation, with a 64-square-meter array) are currently in operation. The manufacturing and launch progress of BlueBird-2 is far behind schedule. In contrast, Starlink has already deployed over 600 of its first-generation D2C satellites and has launched D2C data services via an app on select phones. Its next-generation D2C satellites are rumored to have thousands of directional beams, increasing communication capacity by 20-fold. ASTS's technological lead is shrinking, and the manufacturing and launch costs of BlueBird-2 are far higher than Starlink's. Even with a technical edge, it cannot compete with Starlink on a cost-performance basis.

Starlink's dominance in the D2C constellation market is becoming more solidified, and there is a possibility that operators who once backed ASTS could switch sides.

However, Starlink's D2C service still faces potential challenges.

Most existing mobile phones do not support the AWS-4 and PCS H-Block bands. To use these frequencies in the future, cooperation from handset manufacturers is required. Among these, Apple's stance is the most critical, and Apple has always had a poor relationship with SpaceX. Apple has been planning for D2C service for a long time, with its main satellite partner being Globalstar. It launched ""Emergency SOS via Satellite"" in 2022. However, Globalstar is still a traditional, old-school aerospace company, where delays and high costs are commonplace, and its network deployment is slow (a classic case of ""starting early but finishing late,"" which has become a traditional skill for Apple). When Starlink and T-Mobile launched their D2C service, Apple's response was not very enthusiastic. Although the iPhone series eventually enabled the service, its rollout was slower than that of Samsung and other phone manufacturers.

The future will depend on whether SpaceX and Apple can reconcile. If Apple remains stubborn and opposes SpaceX at the risk of losing money and alienating operators (a small but existing possibility), there isn't much SpaceX can do. As for the idea that SpaceX or Tesla would manufacture their own phones, it's best to take that with a grain of salt.

There is also speculation that SpaceX might enter the market directly and become a mobile communications operator itself. This scenario is also unlikely. SpaceX still holds too few frequency licenses. Becoming an operator involves a very cumbersome process of approvals and qualifications. Partnering with existing operators remains the best option.

Finally, while the D2C market is a ""blue ocean,"" how large is it really?

Starlink's terminal service has already been a great success because there is a huge market for broadband services in remote areas abroad. Capturing this market segment is enough to be profitable. At the same time, Starlink is also planning to compete in the fiber-to-the-home market. At the same technological level, satellite communication cannot compete with fiber optics in densely populated areas. But the reality is that competition is never based on an equivalent level of technology. The quality of home fiber service providers in Europe and America varies greatly, whereas Starlink is the leader among satellite service providers. It's like the saying: ""My average horse is weaker than yours, but my best horse is stronger than your mid-tier horse."" Therefore, SpaceX is actively preparing for Starlink V3 and the next-generation gigabit home terminal to compete with home fiber.

However, the D2C market may not be as large. The standard Starlink terminal service in the US costs about $100 per month. The monthly fee for D2C is only $10. Revenue from Starlink terminal users is expected to exceed $10 billion this year. If D2C service is priced at $10 per month, with operators taking half, reaching a similar revenue scale of $10 billion would require 160 million users. Achieving such a user base is very difficult.

The situation for mobile phones is different from that of fiber optics. No matter how poor the cell towers are, in densely populated areas, D2C can never compete with terrestrial base stations. Starlink terminals can compete with fiber by using large phased-array antennas and high-frequency, wide-bandwidth satellite communication bands. If the speed isn't enough, they can increase the terminal's array size and add more frequency bands. Mobile phones are limited by their size; the antenna's size and power cannot be increased significantly, and acquiring new frequency bands is an arduous battle for every 10 MHz due to operator monopolies.

D2C is a supplementary solution, meant to cover areas without cell tower signals. Elon Musk has also emphasized this in his speeches. If you disagree, you can argue with him on X. Some might say that technology will evolve and D2C will one day surpass base stations. But terrestrial base stations and ground networks are not standing still; they are also advancing. Furthermore, building a D2C satellite network is not cheap. Because phone antennas are small and their performance is limited, the satellites themselves must have higher performance (which is why ASTS is developing a 223-square-meter array), naturally leading to higher costs.

Therefore, D2C is a future development trend, and major operators, phone manufacturers, and satellite companies are all positioning themselves in this space. D2C constellations are emerging one after another, and a winner at the hundred-billion-dollar level might appear. However, the market size is ultimately limited.

1nbwetv,2025-09-08,2025-09-08 14:54:56,Respectfully: Why on earth should I invest *long term* (10+ yrs) into a MAG7?,"So - don't get me wrong: I believe you likely will not lose any money in the long run. You'll even make quite a lot. But what I am asking myself:


I read a lot about people who spend all their money on Google or Nvidia for the money to have doubled in 10 years. Sounds good - but 10 years is REALLY long and it has a risk of failure that the company gets into trouble and the stock goes sideways instead of up.
Why should I invest into e.g. Nvidia in the *long term* meaning 10+ years? Yes, the stock can grow 10% in a short period of time, and maybe double or triple over the whole time, but why shouldn't I sell earlier and realize my winnings I already have? Then I can invest into something else that might grow a little more in a shorter time frame, and so on. This could create more wealth in a shorter time. And I don't mean WSB-like trading here. More like ""read news every day and look in my depot every week"".


I understand that this might be about safety when investing into single stocks (MAG7 will very unlikely vanish). But IF I want safety, why not use an ETF exclusively? Yes, this has less revenue, but: When I invest in the short term, worst case is that it dips first, goes sideways, and sooner or later goes up (hopefully) - it becomes an unwilling long-term hold. When I invest in the long term, worst case is that just when I need it, the stock did just plummet. I make myself dependent on THIS single company.


Do you understand what I mean? I cannot wrap my head around this really. And what explicitly makes me think is that I am currently +20% with Google and think about cashing out. On the other hand, I think Google could still grow quite a lot within a shorter time frame (2-3 years).",0,88,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbwetv/respectfully_why_on_earth_should_i_invest_long/,new,Advice Request,0.4

> Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that he is “confident” that President Donald Trump’s tariff plan “will win” at the Supreme Court, but warned his agency would be forced to issue massive refunds if the high court rules against it.
> 
> If the tariffs are struck down, he said, “we would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the Treasury,” according to an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
> 
> He added, however, that “if the court says it, we’d have to do it.”
> 
> The Trump administration last week asked the Supreme Court for an “expedited ruling” to overturn an appeals court decision that found most of his tariffs on imports from other countries are illegal.
> 
> Generally, the Supreme Court could take as long as early next summer to issue a decision on the legality of Trump’s tariffs.
> 
> Bessent has said that “delaying a ruling until June 2026 could result in a scenario in which $750 billion-$1 trillion in tariffs have already been collected, and unwinding them could cause significant disruption.”
> 
> The prospect of the government having to refund tariffs of that magnitude could mean an unprecedented windfall to the businesses and entities that paid them.

Not sure how likely this is with SCOTUS but the last time Bessent ""warned"" what would happen if their tariffs were voided they lost in the appeals court decision. 

So this could be another signal that they aren't confident in the legality of about half of these tariffs implemented so far (regardless of him saying he's confident)

I'm curious about what companies will be the biggest winners if they are forced to give tariff refunds. I believe the Section 232 tariffs implemented so far will stay in effect, since the appeals court ruling covers tariffs under IEEPA.

P/E ratio is about 22. The stocks been held down due to the AI anti SaaS play. Software will go down the toilet according to some.

With the recent Nano banana update from google, it shows how AI can definitely replace casual licenses.. but realistically if you play with it you'll see the limitations. 

Professionals will most likely gravitate to Adobe as they have AI baked in and you can finish the job professionally. 

Not saying in a few years that AI wont get way better... but until theres business tools in place to edit professionally. Adobe isnt going anywhere.

Although still early stage, Archer’s push into electric vertical takeoff and landing technology is planting the seeds for a fundamentally new way to navigate urban airspace. The kind of energy around Archer isn't coming from hype, it's rooted in real momentum, industrial innovation backed by big-name partners, solid funding, and a clear path toward commercialization

The fact that someone is calling it a “no-brainer” reflects growing recognition that Archer’s mission to elevate mobility isn't some distant fantasy, it’s steadily becoming reality

Between ambitious certification timelines, manufacturing ramp-ups, and smart investments across the commercial and defense side of aviation, Archer is building a narrative that feels increasingly credible and compelling. 
It’s not just about flying taxis, it’s the transformation of urban and regional travel. That feels worth paying attention to, and keeping a positive lens on as we ride this story forward

If you recall, PPTA is on the verge of getting their final permits signed off. As well as gold, the property holds enough Antimony to supply up to 37% of the USA's requirements. America does not produce any Antimony, and it is *critical* for national defense munitions manufacture. No military bullets can be made without antimony. China has banned its export to the USA, and no, it is not a rare earth metal and so that ban has not been lifted. The antimony will get the mine built, the gold will make the money. The Company in a web presentation has stated that it will sell antimony concentrate created during the gold production to offset that production, making it the lowest cost gold producer in the USA, as well as the largest privately owned gold mine. All finances are in place for getting this started up (500M recently raised), and there is a 2B ExIm loan in the works already.

They only have one real permit left to get (I'm pretty sure, if not it is a dubious second). And that one permit has it's public comment period by the Idaho DEQ ending on Sept 8 (this Monday). After that there is some time to address the comments. I'm not sure of the timing but somewhere soon it goes into a draft permit if there are no significant issues. Given the federal permits take years to address, I'm thinking it's close (EDIT: i.e. all the big questions have been resolved with the federal permits and the state permits are much quicker to resolve). The company in one of their recent updates think it should be any time now. They have already stated that they are ready to present the go forward plan to shareholders anytime the permit(s?) complete which they expected in the summer. Likely production/refining by 2029.

**Look for this from June on YouTube (this sub doesn't allow YouTube links): ""Webinar: Perpetua Resources Unlocking the Stibnite Gold Project"".** It's the best overview out there. Also there are monthly updates on their site. Their projected share price in that was based on gold being $3000/oz is $38/share and $50/share at $3500/oz. If you've noticed, gold is climbing above 3600 and likely to go higher. Some speculate that gold will reach 5K in the next few years. And this is based on the current reserves they are about to open. But in fact there is high likelihood that there is nearly double that on their property, based on past exploratory drilling.

The only pain point is the the Nez Pierce tribe filing constant lawsuits. However I don't think any have stuck so far and they seem to be along the same vein. They're trying another one now but I think the counter argument to sink it is, why did you wait till now, this just seems like some blocking/delaying action. And many of their members want the mine for the jobs. They are trying to cause pain to block it, but simply put the mine is too important to the USA not to go forward.

More importantly is the fact that the mine is of significant strategic interest to the United States. Critical strategic interest in fact. Personally I think it is a done deal. It was on Biden's list to get built, Trump's top ten list, the DoD funded much of the permitting work, etc. That's my $0.02. As one should always do, do your own homework. :) Cheers.",22,3,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbc2vz/perpetua_resources_is_being_added_to_the_sptsx_as/,new,Company News,0.84

The Dutch ASML is committing 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) for Mistral’s 1.7 billion euro (\~$2 billion) fundraise and is expected to get a board seat at Mistral, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private negotiations.

The round will make Mistral the most valuable AI company in Europe with a 10-billion-euro ($11.7 billion) pre-money valuation in its latest Series C funding round, the people said.

1nazqw0,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 13:47:46,"The Weak Payroll Report Of Only 22,000 jobs Is Bad For The Market And The Economy","**S&P 500 recovery on 09/5/225:** I believe that the S&P 500's recovery from the day’s low to close just 0.2% down, after a weak payrolls report of 22,000 only net new jobs in August is a perverse reaction anticipating lower interest rates, and is incorrect. 

**Bad news is bad news:** Yes, the 10 year rallied from 4.17% to close at 4.08%, boosting the S&P 500 from the day's low, but weak jobs report confirms a 4 month trend of a softening labor market, it's not a flash in a pan. Further, I don’t see any catalysts for this trend reversing. The average four month payroll growth is now just 25,000, as compared to 185,000 in the same period last year, and 186,000 in 2024. And excluding the pandemic, this is the weakest monthly job creation since 2010. 

**A reliable job sector is showing weakness:** Worse, job creation in non cyclical sectors such as elder care, healthcare, government and municipal services has slowed signifying real barriers to employment growth. Healthcare jobs have always been the growth engine and a reliable one in an aging population, thus the slowdown in this sector is foreboding. Employment in health care and social assistance rose by about 47,000 in August. That’s the smallest monthly increase since January 2022. It’s arguably a big warning sign for the wider labor market given the sector has accounted for more than 40% of all new jobs over the last three years. 

**Non-Farm payrolls was not the only sign** – The JOLTS report showed slowdowns in job openings, unemployment claims have gone up and continuing claims remain high indicating that its getting tougher to find jobs.

**What can the rate cuts do and not do?**

It helps lower the 10-year treasury yield as we saw on Friday, which in turn will reduce mortgage rates and commercial business rates.

It will help housing the most, and ease financial conditions for commercial construction and business, but this will take time to filter through.

It does not directly help job creation

It will inflate assets, especially stocks, which is dangerous.

**Avoid the FOMO and BTD impulses:** Don’t jump in because the Fed will cut in September – that’s already priced in. The Fed will cut rates of at least 25 basis points, possibly 50 at the September 17 meeting, but cuts will take time to impact growth. **What’s not priced in is a weakening economy and a much needed correction in an expensive market.** Don’t chase the rally just on lower interest rates, instead understand that a weak labor market can nudge the country into a recession. To be sure, there has never been a recession with unemployment rates below 6%, and at 4.4% there are no alarm bells, but we’re trudging in the wrong direction. Trade policy uncertainties, AI productivity improvements and DOGE cuts are taking their toll on the economy. Rate cuts may briefly lift valuations,  but you need fundamental improvements to sustain the rally.

1napdma,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 06:02:37,OPEN Reality Check: From Someone Who Actually Built the Products You're Betting On,"*TL;DR:* While I'm rooting for OPEN long-term, the current price will correct down significantly. If you have profits, seriously consider taking some. This is deep in casino mode now - be warned.

Former OPEN leader here. More importantly, I’ve diamond-handed OPEN stock for years. I rode $OPEN up, then all the way down to 50¢. If you've only been holding for weeks, listen up. (*Update*: If my background is a distraction, ignore - most of my points below are public information anyway)

I also spent years protecting regular people from financial predators. The pump-and-dump energy around OPEN right now feels very familiar.

Over the weekend I talked to a few folks ready to jump in without realizing this is pure casino mode -  that’s what pushed me to write this up. If you already know OPEN is pure casino now, no need to keep reading - you likely know the rest already or do not care.

# Where We Are: Phenomenal Momentum, Terrible Risk/Reward

The $OPEN chart might as well have 🚀 on it. Golden Cross, record volume, RSI overbought - every meme signal is flashing. So we got a whopping 10x move from 50¢ in June to $6+ now.

But here’s the problem: options even with the new peak today give you less than 20% odds of hitting $12 in the next few months. 

Translation: you might roll a 6 and 2x, but odds are higher you get smacked with a 40–50% downdraft. 

This rally is priced to flame out in weeks, not years. Think before you YOLO because your buddy doubled last week.

# What Insiders Are Actually Doing

Forget charts. Look at the people with the most information.

* **Carrie** (former CEO)**:** As soon as she was **free** to sell after leaving, she unloaded \~$35M at $5/share. Usually that’s all you need to know.
* **Shrisha** (interim CEO): Yes, bought 30k shares - first insider buy I remember. Props, but symbolic. He already had a [4,250,000](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000180116925000078/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1756411509.xml) share grant, and his cash comp just jumped by [another $500k-$1M](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000114036125033195/ef20054807_8ka.htm). A 30k buy is <1% of his stake and covered by his raise. To be clear, I'm rooting for him and have been very impressed by his leadership, but that buy isn't something you should make big bets on.
* **Veterans:** Every insider free to sell I've talked to has sold everything (except one). That includes 10-year veterans who have seen it all. And more telling: no one is buying.

Sure, insiders sell for all kinds of reasons. But here’s the pattern: nobody was buying at $2 - and they sure aren’t buying at $6–7. that tells you everything.

# Why the Bull Arguments Don't Hold Water

I hear the bull cases - “I will wait for Fed cuts / new CEO / earnings.” Here’s why they don’t stack up:

* **Rates: Already Baked In** The stock trades higher now than when rates were close to zero and Opendoor was doing 5x the revenue. A predictable 25 bps cut in two weeks? Classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” (look it up) - the price might actually drop. 
* **Q3 Earnings Will Be Brutal:** Don't take my word for it. Opendoor's own [guidance](https://www.opendoor.com/articles/2025-second-quarter-financial-results) shows revenue dropping 50% from Q2's $1.57B to just $800-875M in Q3. They also forecast returning to losses: adjusted EBITDA loss of $21-28M after barely eking out a $23M profit in Q2. How do you think retail buyers will react when earnings show a 50% revenue drop?
* **New CEO Won't Be Magic:** Short of hiring Elon Musk, no new CEO can justify a 5x-10x price jump alone. The business model challenges remain the same regardless of who's in charge. Leadership takes time. This market won’t wait.

# Bottom Line

I'm not saying OPEN is worthless or to trash the company. I genuinely want the company, and the years of work by some of the most talented people I have known, to be lasting. The Q2 2025 positive EBITDA of $23M was a monumental achievement after years of losses.

But this 1000% rally has priced in years of perfect execution. You're betting everything goes right - housing recovers, margins improve, debt becomes manageable.

Even if the next two weeks are great, the next few months will likely be ugly. Q3 earnings will show that 50% revenue drop. The new CEO search will take time. Rate cuts won't magically fix the business model. And when reality hits, this thing will fall fast.

**If you have profits:** Take some off the table. Insiders sold at well below $5, you're sitting at $6-7.

**If you believe long-term:** Wait for a better entry point. This isn't your last chance.

**If you're speculating:** Set stops and don't risk money you can't lose.

I know I'll get hate from true believers (whom I respect) and from pumpers looking for exit liquidity. That's fine. Call me a pessimist or worse - that's better than watching ordinary people get wrecked.

> Nestle has fired its chief executive after just one year in the job because he failed to disclose a ""romantic relationship"" with a ""direct subordinate"". The Swiss food giant, which makes Kit Kat chocolate bars and Nespresso coffee capsules, said Laurent Freixe had been dismissed with ""immediate effect"" following an investigation led by Nestle's chair and lead independent director. The BBC understands the inquiry was triggered by a report made through the company's whistleblowing channel. Nestle chair Paul Bulcke said: ""This was a necessary decision. Nestle's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestle.""

> The relationship was with an employee who is not on the executive board and the investigation began because it represented a conflict of interest, the BBC has learned. As well as Mr Bulcke, independent director Pablo Isla oversaw the inquiry into Mr Freixe ""with the support of independent outside counsel"". The Financial Times has reported that concerns were raised about Mr Freixe's relationship with an employee earlier this year and, after an internal investigation, the claims were found to be unsubstantiated. After the complaints persisted, the newspaper reports that Nestle conducted another investigation with help from outside counsel after which the claims were upheld.

1n9jpac,2025-09-05,2025-09-05 18:57:15,"Kinsale Capital Group ($KNSL) - Expensive on the surface, a long term high quality growth opportunity underneath","Disclaimer: I currently own a small tracker position <1% of my portfolio. Looking to increase to a 15-20% position over the coming months to year.

Kinsale Capital ($KNSL) is a lesser known name in the property and casualty (P&C) insurance space. Formed in 2009 by founder and CEO Michael Kehoe (see speech from him on YT talking on Baron conference) with others from James River, the company went public in 2016 and has since delivered a ~22X return for investors since IPO. I believe this company has much more room for growth, and the recent multiple compression occurring over the last 2 years due to no significant share price movement offers a good entry point for new long term investors.

Kinsale Capital is the only publicly traded pure play excess and surplus (E&S) insurer of P&C. Basically for those that don't follow the insurance industry, this is a ""niche"" insurance market for risk that the standard market cannot bear, underwrite or price. This market has a total adressable value of >115B. It's for policies that carry too much risk or are so unconventional that no standard insurer (i.e. Progressive, Libery Mutual, GEICO...) in the admitted market will accept it. Think risky buisnesses like a night club in a rough part of town, a weapons manufacturer, a demolitions company, or a business that has already made multiple claims in the past. Where standard insurers turn away from this risk, Kinsale steps in. The E&S market is not limited by regulations and policies as compared to the standard market, and Kinsale is allowed to thereby create its own prices to fully adjust for the risk it bears and add significant exclusions to its policies to limit risk.

Anywho, Kehoe discusses the business quite well in his speech from the Baron conference, so you can get a more detailed idea by watching the video.

Sounds great? What's the catch?

The company has historically traded at a significant premium valuation for an insurance/financial business, which I believe is why the stock has been relatively stagnant since October 2023. It has had two short thesis written on it on VIC and have heard of other shorts explaining their thesis on YouTube. Shorts have thus far not succeeded in their plays. Its 5 year average trailing PE has hovered around 38, and forward PE of 34. It has also carried a significant price to book premium of 7-8x, as compared to most insurance carriers at 1-2x.

Since October 2023 with no significant movement in share price, the multiples have compressed as the buisness continues to grow. The trailing and fwd PE now hovers around 24, and price to book has contracted to a, still frothy, 6x.

My thesis lies in my conviction that this premium is well justified. Following Buffets timeless saying, own wonderful businesses at fair prices, as compared to fair businesses at wonderful prices.

There are several factors that stand out with Kinsale which I believe justify it's high valuation. The company is growing significantly faster than most insurance carriers. Net income and underwriting income y/y continues to grow at rates from 25-45%. The ROE sits comfortably around 30%. The company also has a combined ratio, the primary metric used by insurance carriers to show profitability after accounting for claims payouts and business expenses, of astounding percentages in the mid-70s. As of the most recent quarter, 75.8% - this is practically unheard of in the insurance business. Most insurers average in the low to mid 90s (lower is better, indicating more profitability. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit while combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss).

The company operates a lean, low cost business model and only has about 700 full time employees. Kehoe has stated that they are very disciplined in their underwriting and carry conservative loss reserves. The E&S space continues to also grow annually in the low teens, roughly double that of the standard P&C space in the mid single digits. Kehoe further describes a business quality that other insurers don't have is a contemporary and centralized software to process claims quickly, where other insurers who rely on M&A must compile data across many legacy platforms that decrease efficiency and time to process claims. Kehoe also has a large shareholder incentive as the majority of his wealth is tied to Kinsale, as Chris Mayer says, skin in the game - Kehoe owns about 3.8% of the company. Finally, the company appears to have significant room for growth, as they only hold about 1.4% of the TAM of E&S policies based on their financial presentation.

While I don't think Kinsale is a screaming buy, I believe this is a good entry point for a long term position that will continue to show positive and upward momentum in the next 5-10 years.

Risks:

- Continues to carry a premium valuation despite recent years multiple compression, still holds P/B of 6x, well above industry peers

- Recent decline in growth of their largest line, commercial property, though all other lines continue to grow at ~15%

- Operates in a risky and litigious insurance space, battles with many litigations over claims

Or rather, they think the Fed can’t tell what’s causing the slowdown in jobs and will eventually cut rates mindlessly.

Look at the manufacturing sector, the biggest victim of tariffs. Not only have tariffs failed to help them recover, but high raw material prices have also destroyed their competitiveness. Is this something that cutting interest rates can fix? Sigh.

1n9dojz,2025-09-05,2025-09-05 14:52:50,Elon Musk New Pay Package is the Inverse of what is institutional knowledge,"They just released his new 1 trillon dollar pay package that in order to hit would require certain targets. This is the only time that I've seen so many inverse things happen like this.

* Giving a founder additional shares to do his job just to motivate him when the majority of his wealth is based on Tesla in the first place, Refreshers are normal and option plans are normal, but needing 1T worth of them is not.
* They think that old Elon who used to captivate an audience through being progressive and promoting the future... will somehow return (not only has he lost steam for promising lofty ideas but people are finally tired of broken promises by him, every year its another almost there target for self driving. Also where is the new roadster?)
* Everyone is tired of Elon standing on stage trying to compute how to speak  as he jumps around and does salutes ""as a joke""  vs someone who sits back and builds out the company to its full potential
* The company still caters to a a high end, well educated consumer for their products. As soon as he lost the base for it he did all the damage control he could. He literally tried to have Trump sell his cars on the Whitehouse green, that's how desperate its got for him crying on twitch (a gaming platform) about people hating him.
* The board of directors is  stacked in his favor but also is so fearful of him that they won't standup to him. They at least have enough of a spine to make sure he hits targets to get his package. Although he will never meet those goals so I guess if you are an Elon Supporter this is great news (your lord is staying around) if you are inbetween you know what you are getting and if you hate him, well he has a giant carrot Infront of him to do something.

I think that the pay package is so strange as somehow he will recover the mess he created. If I joined a company (as Elon joined Tesla, he didn't create it) then got it to the position where he risked everything to make it the brand/success it is, then tanked it by his political/ketamine rants, then was offered 1T to act normal and bring it all back.... I'd be the luckiest person on earth. This story is bonkers.

**I'd rather see they pay someone a 1 trillion dollar pay package to wipe Elon's image out of the Tesla picture or** associated with Elon. A rebrand to being progressive, for human rights, and a environmental company .

This is the strangest pay package I've ever seen. The bottom line is, if they hired any reputable CEO that can re-establish the brand of being a modern, progressive company, they would be back on track, not trying to force this monstrosity back into its cage with money.

Tesla in Europe, China, and even North America sales are steadily declining, tax credit offsets are ending, the company needs a new face, and Elon is the worst way to promote what was once the progressive movement.

EDIT:  
To everyone saying that if they don't offer this up he'll leave and either start another competitor or destroy the brand. The issue is the brand is destroyed already by someone who tweets about illegal aliens and governement conspiracies all day and night. How has his ventures gone since he became the DOGE psychopath? XAi is a dumster fire of VC money, Boring Company has.... built a tunnel under vegas convention center that has human drivers for robo taxi's, sales have steadily declined, solar and battery have been taken over by other companies, uhhh what am I missing?

I understand that Trump's tariff court fight right now can impose some threat to these exclusive companies, but I don't see how that would change much, since the US government has already decided to back up those companies. Oh, and the semiconductor sector got hit pretty hard this week too.

Last time top comments suggested other storage providers over STX & WD. But since then, 

STX up 3x

WD up 2x.

If not direct demand for their products, is this an indirect demand ?

Do you believe it will last longer like in 2030s ? Or this will be gone by then ? What is your hypothesis ?

AI depends on data. This data will need to be stored somewhere. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) do most of the storing of world's data currently. SSDs (solid state/flash) carry the rest of the data.

[https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/)

Will AI need more HDD or SSD ? Or both and hence demand for both will go up ?

There are only few (like 3/4 ?) manufacturers of storage. STX, WD, Toshiba being the major ones. While their recent quarter revenues haven't yet shown any large demand related to AI and revenues haven't shown increase like that in NVDA revenue, wouldn't in the future they will have more AI driven demand ? like multiple times of current demand ?

If yes, how come these stocks are down ? recent revenues were down but isn't that like ignoring the potential demand from AI requirements ?

Or will AI become smart enough (learn using existing data) to require not much additional storage and thus there won't be much demand growth due to AI for storage?

Alphabet Inc.’s Google was fined almost €3 billion ($3.5 billion) by the European Union and ordered to stop favoring its own advertising technology services, in a move that risks further inflaming tensions with US President Donald Trump.
The European Commission said Friday that Google had abused its dominance by giving its own ad exchanges a competitive advantage over rivals and that it must bring the practices to an end.

“When markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power,” EU antitrust commissioner Teresa Ribera said in a statement. “True freedom means a level playing field, where everyone competes on equal terms and citizens have a genuine right to choose.”

The company immediately vowed to appeal. Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice president for regulatory affairs at Google, said the move “imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money.”

The EU punishment comes at a tense moment for EU–US trade relations, with Trump repeatedly deriding the bloc’s efforts to rein in Silicon Valley giants. Although Google faces antitrust scrutiny worldwide, it won some relief this week when a US judge ruled that its search business would not need to be broken up to address the harms alleged by the Department of Justice.

Google’s adtech operations, however, also remain under threat in the US. The DOJ is expected to file proposed remedies later on Friday, ahead of a Sept. 22 hearing on those proposals. Previously, the department had floated forcing Google to divest its Ad Manager platform to tackle the alleged anticompetitive risks.

The EU warned Google in 2023 that it had abused its dominance in advertising technology to harm online publishers. At the time, the Brussels-based commission said Google had favored its own ad exchange program over its rivals and bolstered the company’s central role in the ad tech supply chain.
Ribera’s predecessor Margrethe Vestager warned then that only a “mandatory divestment” of part of its business would solve the issues. The Dane had spent a decade in Brussels, where she hit Google with fines of more than €8 billion across three different cases, although one penalty was annulled and another cut by EU judges.",711,216,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n98aaa/google_fined_almost_3_billion_by_eu_for_abusing/,new,Company News,0.95

You may remember me from such classics as “$LULU - the bar is low” where I mentioned that I had a $1 million investment in Lulu stock at $205.

I went through the numbers and listened in on the call, and while I feel there is some turbulence ahead, I feel that it’s not all doom and gloom.

1) Tariffs have hurt, but the de minimis exemption removal was particularly painful. Increasing prices in a softening macro isn’t the way to do it, but price increases will come as rate cuts boost the economy. There is also a wild card out here: the Supreme Court may rule the tariffs illegal and order all tariffs collected to be refunded. Lutnick’s own ex-firm, which is being run by his sons, is reportedly betting on this outcome.

2) Management has had their “come to Jesus” moment. Calvin has done well and presided over massive growth, but I think they got a little too cocky. No doubt he is feeling the pressure over the 67% stock slump, and they will shake things up now and go back to what made them great to begin with. More product innovation, more technical apparel, and more frequent refreshes. They can’t just introduce a slightly different color for a model of leggings and call it a day. 

3) An activist could get involved, which could likely be Chip Wilson, the founder and a major shareholder. Chip built this company from scratch and has an uncanny sense of what the consumer wants. The last time Lulu slipped up (2018) Chip tried to buy it out. He didn’t succeed, but the changes he demanded resulted in a 10x of the stock.

4) The stock has never been this cheap; it’s at a low teens PE. Yes, the E may fall a bit more, but Lulu has $1.2 billion in cash and they’ve been actively buying back shares. If they reduce capex (they should, no need to grow store count during this time) they can direct free cash to buying up cheap shares and increasing EPS metrics.

5) Their main competitor, Alo, is not public yet. They’re spending balls-to-the-wall on influencers in order to goose their revenue so they get a higher multiple for their IPO. However, Alo has much higher CAQ and lower customer retention than Lulu, so it’s not sustainable.

By the way, before anyone declares them dead, they will have $11 BILLION in sales this year and they are very profitable. 

I’m deep in the red, but I’m not selling. I think we are higher in a few months. ",2,40,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n96qiw/lulu_has_it_bottomed/,new,Unknown,0.53

1n92hmm,2025-09-05,2025-09-05 07:18:21,ACHR Discussion: Can eVTOLs Ever Be Profitable?,"Greetings,

Archer Aviation (ACHR) has been on my radar as one of the more ambitious names in the emerging eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) space. With the stock now trading under $10, it’s worth taking a closer look from a value perspective.

**The Bear Case: Heavy Cash Burn and Dilution**

**Massive Cash Burn:** Archer is losing ~$500M in free cash flow annually. Scaling aircraft manufacturing is extremely capital intensive & it may be years before the company can generate positive cash flow

**Dilution Risk:** Shares outstanding are up more than 50% YoY as the company raised $850M last quarter. This shareholder dilution could continue as Archer funds its manufacturing buildout.

**Execution Risk:** To cover its expenses, Archer would need to deliver 300+ Midnight aircraft annually, far above the 50 planned in the near term. Any delays in certification or ramp up could extend losses and erode investor confidence.


**The Bull Case: Strategic Backers and Market Potential**

**Strong Investors:** Boeing, United Airlines, Stellantis, and ARK Invest are all backing Archer. This validation from major aviation players gives credibility to its long-term vision.

**Cash Runway:** With $1.7B on the balance sheet, Archer has several years of runway to prove itself, even at the current burn rate.

**Commercial Opportunities:** Initial deliveries to Abu Dhabi Aviation, plans for taxi routes at the LA 2028 Olympics, and potential defense contracts with Anduril offer multiple paths to revenue.

**Urban Mobility Moat:** If eVTOL becomes mainstream, Archer could benefit from first-mover advantage in building networks in cities where time savings (10min flights vs. hour long drives) have clear value

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/time-to-buy-the-dip-on-archer-aviation-stock-below-10/ar-AA1LR8n0?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds

**My Take:**
At under $10, Archer offers exposure to a potentially transformative technology but comes with serious risks. The high burn rate and reliance on capital raises make it vulnerable, yet the backing of large industry players and its international traction provide a real (though speculative) upside case

For me, this falls into the optionality bucket it could be a multi bagger if execution goes right or a value trap if certification drags and dilution continues

**Questions for the community:**

-Do you believe Archer can realistically ramp from 50 aircraft per year to 300+ within a decade?

-How do you handicap the probability of FAA approval by 2028?

-Would you treat ACHR as a venture style bet/ does the dilution risk outweigh the upside?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Same-store sales in the Americas were down 4%. Overall comparable sales increased just 1% compared to Wall Street estimates of 2.2%.

It projects third-quarter revenues will be between $2.47 billion and $2.50 billion compared to Wall Street estimates of $2.57 billion. The company said it expects earnings per share in the next quarter to be between $2.18 and $2.23 per share, compared to an estimate of $2.93 per share.

It makes me think about solar. Years ago, solar power was too costly and not advanced enough to matter. Now solar stocks are a big part of clean energy investing. Could recycling stocks follow the same path?

If the tech keeps improving, waste might not just be trash anymore. It could become something valuable, like a resource people invest in.

What do you think? Could recycling become the next big area for clean tech stocks? Which companies are worth watching?",38,51,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n8b0k4/if_recycling_tech_keeps_advancing_could_waste/,new,Industry Discussion,0.78
1n8aitu,2025-09-04,2025-09-04 09:44:27,American Eagle’s Earnings Blowout is Bullish for $GAP,"American Eagle stock shot up nearly 30% after their earnings yesterday afternoon citing the Sydney Sweeney ad as a driver for their sales. That’s right, the controversial Sydney Sweeney ad in which the clothes she’s wearing kinda look like shit actually boosted their clothing sales. That ad came out a month ago and has 8 million views on YouTube.

Gap released their denim ad with Katseye 2 weeks ago. The ad already has 15 million views on YouTube, the engagement is crazy across all social media, it is beloved by men and women of all ages, features diversity in an organic way, and the clothes look fucking amazing on those women. There’s a ton of analysis from marketing professionals praising Gap’s ability to capture the momentum from the Sydney Sweeney ad and put out something that appears to be much more successful and effective. 

Gap has been on an uptrend since their last earnings, and I’m confident the virality of the Katseye ad paired with the now proven effectiveness of the Sydney Sweeney ad through AEO’s earnings will keep Gap’s momentum going. I don’t think the market has appropriately priced in the potential effectiveness of the Katseye ad converting into sales, and $AEO’s last earnings provide some confirmation that more positive sentiment is justified. 

P/E is only 9.73, and market cap is about 8 billion. There is room to move. 

Positions: $GAP shares. And 12/19 $25 calls for a potential gap fill from May 2024 between now and their next earnings in November. ",0,38,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n8aitu/american_eagles_earnings_blowout_is_bullish_for/,new,Company Analysis,0.38

Meanwhile, the market is underappreciating the rising quality of Google’s ad leads, which will cause pricing to go up, providing another tailwind for the stock.

Mahaney’s current price target for the stock sits at $240 per share, implying an upside of 13%. But he believes shares could eventually rise to around the $300 level, which is approximately 42% than where shares are currently trading.

Mahaney added that this ruling is also a “big win” for Apple.

“This has clearly been an overhang on Apple stock, and now they’ve got this almost guaranteed $20, $25 billion a year, and super high margin revenue coming their way thanks to Google,” he said. Some stocks like MS, GS, AXP, BGM, RXRX are in my watchlist because I think these Google's move may have impacts on these AI stuff.

1n7q8at,2025-09-03,2025-09-03 16:36:50,Salesforce issues weak revenue guidance even as earnings beat estimates,"Salesforce issued disappointing guidance on Wednesday, even as earnings and revenue topped estimates for the fiscal second quarter. The stock dropped 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.91 adjusted vs. $2.78 expected
* **Revenue:** $10.24 billion vs. $10.14 billion expected

Revenue increased 10% from $9.33 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income rose to $1.89 billion, or $1.96 per share, from $1.43 billion, or $1.47 per share, a year ago.

For the fiscal third quarter, management called for $2.84 to $2.86 in adjusted earnings per share on $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had been looking for $2.85 per share on $10.29 billion in revenue.

Salesforce maintained its full-year revenue outlook but now sees higher earnings. The company is targeting $11.33 to $11.37 in adjusted earnings per share on $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion in revenue. The consensus estimate from LSEG was $11.31 in earnings per share and $41.2 billion in revenue. The forecast in May included $11.27 to  $11.33 in adjusted earnings per share.

Salesforce has fallen out of favor on Wall Street this year due to an extended stretch of meager revenue growth, which has been stuck in the single digits since mid-2024. While the company regularly touts its investments in artificial intelligence and the advancements in its software and systems, it hasn’t been lifted by the AI boom in the same way as many of its tech peers.

Going into Wednesday’s report, Salesforce was down 23% for the year, lagging behind all but one stock in the Dow and trailing all other large-cap tech companies.

The ratio of Salesforce’s enterprise value to its free cash flow has reached a 10-year low because of fears of disruption from AI, according to analysts at Jefferies, who have a buy rating on the stock. Salesforce is trying to counter the pressure by selling its Agentforce AI software that can automate the handling of customer service questions.

During the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce said it was planning to increase the cost of some products and announced its intent to acquire data management software company Informatica for $8 billion.

1n7q103,2025-09-03,2025-09-03 16:29:26,Figma’s stock plunges after company’s first earnings report since IPO,"Figma shares plunged 13% in extended trading on Wednesday after the design software company reported results for the first time since its IPO in July.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** breakeven
* **Revenue:** $249.6 million vs. $248.8 million expected

Revenue increased 41% year over year in the second quarter from a year earlier, Figma said in a statement. The company provided a preliminary estimate of $247 million to $250 million in a July regulatory filing. CNBC isn’t including a profit estimate because it’s Figma’s first earnings report.

Net income totaled $846,000, compared with a loss of $827.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. The company’s adjusted operating income came to $11.5 million, after Figma provided a prior estimate of $9 million to $12 million.

For the third quarter, Figma forecast revenue of between $263 million and $265 million, which would represent about 33% growth at the middle of the range. The LSEG consensus was $256.8 million.

The company sees between $88 million and $98 million in adjusted operating income for the full year and a little over $1.02 billion in revenue. The revenue range implies about 37% growth and is above the $1.01 billion LSEG consensus.

In the second quarter, Figma announced Figma Make, which uses artificial intelligence to compose app and website designs based on a user’s descriptions, and Figma Sites, which turns designs into working websites. The company also acquired vector graphics startup Modyfi and content management system startup Payload.

A number of software vendors have faced pressure this year due to concerns surrounding AI and whether it will displace business. Figma co-founder and CEO Dylan Field said he’s not seeing that play out internally and that, if anything, the role of designers will only become more critical.

“I think that the more that software becomes easier to build with AI, the more that people are going to see that that human touch is needed,” Field said. He acknowledged that Figma has been adopting so-called vibe-coding tools for AI-driven software development.

Figma reported a 129% net retention rate, a reflection of expansion with existing customers. The figure was down from 132% in the first quarter.

Following its IPO, Figma expects a share sale lockup to expire for 25% some employees’ stock after market close on Sept. 4. Investors holding just over half of Figma’s outstanding Class A stock have agreed to an extended lock-up that will expire in August 2026 for about 35% of their shares.

Field said he wanted to provide clarity for investors.

“That’s something that I think is valuable information,” he said.

On Wednesday the company’s stock closed at $68.13. The company priced shares in its IPO at $33, and saw the stock pop to $115.50 in its debut.

The company’s splashy, yet controversial, campaign with the “Euphoria” star led to some criticism and blowback but the launch, coupled with a recent partnership with Taylor Swift’s new fiancé Travis Kelce, has led to new customer acquisition and positive traffic across channels. 

American Eagle stock soared more than 20% in after-hours trading Wednesday.

“The fall season is off to a positive start. Fueled by stronger product offerings and the success of recent marketing campaigns with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce, we have seen an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales,” CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a news release. “We look forward to building on our progress and the continued strength of our iconic brands to drive higher profitability, long-term growth and shareholder value.” 

The company also re-issued its full-year guidance after withdrawing it earlier this year. It now expects comparable sales to be approximately flat, better than the 0.2% decline analysts had anticipated, according to StreetAccount. 

It still expects gross margin to be down for the duration of the year, but it made key changes to its outlook for operating income, which is bearing the brunt of the tariff impact. The company is now expecting its full-year operating income to be between $255 million and $265 million, down from a previous range of between $360 million and $375 million. 

Here’s how American Eagle performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 45 cents vs. 21 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $1.28 billion vs. $1.24 billion expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $77.6 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with $77.3 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales fell to $1.28 billion, down slightly from $1.29 billion a year earlier. 

For the current quarter, American Eagle is expecting comparable sales to be up in the low single digit range, better than the 0.9% uptick analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. It’s expecting the same trend during the fourth quarter.

> WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing contracted for a sixth straight month in August as factories dealt with the fallout from the Trump administration's import tariffs, with some manufacturers describing the current business environment as ""much worse than the Great Recession.""
> 
> The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Tuesday also showed some manufacturers complaining that the sweeping import duties were making it difficult to manufacture goods in the United States. President Donald Trump has defended his protectionist trade policy, which has raised the nation's average tariff rate to the highest in a century, as necessary to revive a long-declining U.S. industrial base.
> 
> That was reinforced by government data showing spending on the construction of factories dropped in July and was down 6.7% from a year ago. A U.S. appeals court ruled last Friday that most of Trump's tariffs were illegal, adding more uncertainty for businesses.
> 
> ""I continue to see the broad economy generally and the manufacturing sector in particular as in a holding pattern until tariff-related uncertainty recedes,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander U.S. Capital Markets.
> 
> The ISM said its manufacturing PMI edged up to 48.7 last month from 48.0 in July. A PMI reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for 10.2% of the economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PMI would rise to 49.0.
> 
> Seven industries, including textile mills, miscellaneous manufacturing and primary metals, reported growth last month. Among the 10 industries reporting contraction were makers of paper products, machinery, electrical equipment, appliances and components as well as computer and electronic products.
> 
> Tariffs continued to dominate commentary from manufacturers. Some makers of transportation equipment said conditions were worse than the 2007-09 recession, adding ""there is absolutely no activity"" and ""this is 100 percent attributable to current tariff policy and the uncertainty it has created."" Some viewed the conditions as consistent with ""stagflation.""
> 
> Some electrical equipment, appliances and components producers complained that ""'made in the USA' has become even more difficult due to tariffs on many components."" They said the ""administration wants manufacturing jobs in the U.S., but we are losing higher-skilled and higher-paying roles."" Others reported that because of the lack of ""stability in trade and economics, capital expenditures spending and hiring are frozen.""

Webull (BULL) is currently trading around 13.2/share. It IPOd on 11Apr right at market lows. There was immediate interest sending the IPO price from $12 to $60, then a sell off to $11. 

Financials: 
Revenue Q1 = $117M
Revenue Q2 = $131.5M
Q3 projection = $150M 

Yes they have competition from other brokerages, but their market edge is lower trading fees and easy to use app. They now also permit other forms of trading which im not allowed to specify on this sub. 

So why webull? 

If you do a simple Revenue vs. Market cap comparison of brokerages, Webull is by far the most undervalued brokerage - likely because they recently had smaller market exposure pre-IPO and the IPO timing was horrible. 

Webull would be trading at $39/share using a revenue vs market cap vs. Share price comparison to other brokerages (aggregate). 

In other words, if Webulls financials were treated the same as other brokerages, it should simply be close to $40/share. 

$13/share is outrageously undervalued for this brokerage. Time and value will realize itself and Webull will be trading at $40/share soon. Just a matter of time.

Waller proceeded to lecture the audience that what people don't understand is ""see through inflation"".  He said people don't understand that this is just temporary and caused by tariffs and you need to see through it and it will soon go away.  I guess by magic,  he didn't say what would cause it to go away.

1n7gn4d,2025-09-03,2025-09-03 10:40:52,"Macy’s shares jump 20% as retailer tops earnings estimates, raises outlook","Macy’s posted fiscal second-quarter earnings Wednesday that easily topped Wall Street’s expectations, as it said revamped stores helped sales trends.

The department store operator also raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance. It now expects adjusted earnings of between $1.70 and $2.05 per share, compared with $1.60 to $2 per share, and revenue between $21.15 billion and $21.45 billion, compared with $21 billion to $21.4 billion.

The stock surged 20% in early trading on Wednesday.

Macy’s had slashed its full-year guidance last quarter and reported uncertainty in sales due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

“We’re just well positioned right now for the environment we’re in to take share, to deliver for our customers and to provide a better experience,” CEO Tony Spring told CNBC in an interview.

Last quarter, the company said it was hiking prices of certain products to offset tariff costs. Spring said Wednesday that the company now has tariff impacts included in its outlook and remains cautiously optimistic about the future.

“Tariffs are real. It’s a component of the business, but we have tail winds that we are trying to mitigate against those headwinds,” Spring said. “That’s a better customer experience, that’s a newer assortment, that’s less redundancy in our assortment, that’s now a business that’s growing across all three nameplates in our portfolio and a healthy inventory position going into the fall season.”

Spring added that the consumer remains resilient and continues to spend on new items and fashion.

Macy’s said it saw its best comparable sales growth in 12 quarters, and Spring said the retailer’s strategy is leaning into business segments that are working to keep its momentum going, including growth in denim, women’s contemporary apparel and watches.

Here’s how the company performed during its fiscal second quarter, compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 41 cents adjusted vs. 18 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $4.81 billion vs. $4.76 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Aug. 2, the company’s net income was $87 million, or 31 cents per share, compared with $150 million, or 53 cents per share, the year prior. Net sales dropped from $4.94 billion in the year-ago period to $4.81 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were 41 cents.

Macy’s said the group of 125 stores that the company has chosen to focus on with higher staffing and renovations, outperformed the broader Macy’s brand, seeing comparable sales growth of 1.1% on an owned basis.

The department store also owns Bloomingdale’s, which reported comparable sales growth of 3.6% on an owned basis, and Bluemercury, which saw comparable sales rise 1.2%. Those two brands have consistently performed better than the Macy’s namesake stores.

The company also reported a $28 million increase in credit card net revenue to $153 million.

“When you think about the strength of a department store or a marketplace, it’s when multiple categories are working,” Spring said Wednesday.

CFO Tom Edwards said on a call with analysts on Wednesday that Macy’s is exploring more price hikes on certain products because of tariffs.

“We’re adjusting prices, but as appropriate, not broad-based and really assessing it with our partners in an effort to remain competitive,” Edwards said. “I believe that we are really well positioned to navigate through this time given our business model.”

Merchants, such as Walmart, Amazon, and many more, love BNPL because people tend to purchase more items, as well as items they don't immediately need.  In fact, they're willing to pay 3% to 8% fee for BNPL operating companies to complete the purchase, which would be substantially more than the credit card fee of 2 to 3%.  On top of the merchants' fees, BNPL has strict late fees and a high interest rate for late payments.

The BNPL market reached $340 billion globally in 2024 and continues to grow year over year. In 2024, 86.5 million Americans used BNPL services across retail categories.

1n7ejyn,2025-09-03,2025-09-03 09:17:10,Markets are at record highs. Which growth stocks still have room in H2 2025? Here are 5 with surprising data,"The S&P and Nasdaq are sitting near record highs…but not every growth stock has run as hard as the mega-caps. Some names are showing double digit sales growth and EPS momentum while still trading below their 2021 peak valuations…

Here are a few that stood out to me (data from Finviz / company filings):

APP (Applovin): +36% YTD; EPS +102% this year; sales growth +34% YoY; forward P/E ~32.8

DASH (DoorDash): +47% YTD; EPS up ~750%; revenue +23.8% YoY; forward P/E ~63

CVNA (Carvana): +76% YTD; EPS growth +170%; sales +39.5% YoY; forward P/E ~117

NET (Cloudflare): +82% YTD; +138% 1-year return; forward P/E ~176.7

PINS (Pinterest): EPS +41%; profit margin ~49%; sales +17% YoY; forward P/E ~16.6

These are all strong movers, but the valuations range wildly…Some look like they still have room to run, while others may already be stretched…

Which of these growth names do you think can still outperform in H2?

Do high forward P/Es make them too risky at these levels, or are fundamentals strong enough to justify it?

Like some other retailers with low or no dividends they trade at very high PE multiples.  Their share prices have been bullet-proof, no doubt bolstered by the increasing average age of cars in the US.   But, take ORLY for example at a PE of 37 and market cap of $88 billion (bigger than either Ford or GM or Cummins).

Net income 2021 - 2024 up from $2.16 to $2.39 billion (only 10% increase).  CPI inflation is more than that (18.5% since Dec-2021).   This even when their store count is up by over 10% over the same period.  They are not growing like a tech company despite their 37 PE.

Long term debt up from $3.8  -  $5.5 billion (50% increase).

Their earnings per share have increased, as they buy back shares rather then pay dividends.  Though it seems like much of those purchases are funded by added debt.   That has worked out for them as their share price has gone from \~$50 then  to >$100 today, but I wonder if share buybacks at $100 will look so wise in the future.

Insider transactions seem to be tilted to selling ($9 million recently by a senior VP).

“We will begin driving manually before validating our technology and operations for fully autonomous services in the future,” a company spokesperson said in an email. Waymo announced the tests in blog posts.

The autonomous vehicle venture aims to expand its driverless, ride-hailing service across the U.S. after already launching commercial operations in Austin, Texas, as well as Atlanta, San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles.

In some markets, including Austin and Atlanta, Waymo’s driverless rides can only be hailed through the Uber app. In others, riders must use the company’s standalone Waymo One app to book a robotaxi.

Safety drivers, who are employees of Waymo, will man the steering and braking behind the test vehicles in Denver and Seattle. The company is also running similar tests with its robotaxis in New York, having recently obtained permits in the biggest U.S. market.

The company’s test fleet in Denver and in Seattle will include a mix of their fully electric Jaguar iPace and Geely Zeekr AVs.

Waymo told CNBC that it will have up to a dozen cars each in Denver and Seattle to start testing.

Waymo’s primary competition on the global stage is Baidu-owned Apollo Go in China, which operates driverless ride-hailing services throughout Asia. Meanwhile, Tesla has obtained a permit to operate a ride-hailing business in Texas, and is testing a manned robotaxi service in Austin and another in San Francisco.

Honestly, it feels like there are too many headwinds piling up at the same time, and no one can agree on which one is the real driver.

September is usually a bad month for stocks anyway, especially for tech. Maybe this is just the classic seasonal slump playing out. But it also feels like the other stuff going on is making it worse. A federal appeals court just ruled most of Trump’s tariffs were illegal, which doesn’t kill tariffs forever but does leave everything messy. Nobody knows what the new rules will look like, which goods are impacted, or if companies might even get refunds for what’s already been collected. That kind of limbo is exactly what markets hate.

Then there’s the government shutdown risk. Congress has until September 30 to figure it out, and the odds of a shutdown are being thrown around at 40 percent. If it happens, you could see cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which would ripple through the economy. Maybe they pass a short-term patch that drags this into December, but even the back-and-forth in DC is enough to make investors nervous.

The Fed adds another layer. Nobody’s sure what their next move is, and stocks entered September priced for perfection, so the bar is high. When valuations are stretched like this, even a little bit of bad news can knock things down. Add in the jobs report coming on Friday, and you’ve got another potential swing factor hanging over the week.

So yeah, between seasonality, tariffs, shutdown talk, and Fed uncertainty, the market just feels heavy right now. I’m curious what everyone thinks is weighing the most.

Option 3, we remain a fiat currency.  According to the Triffin dilemma, we have to continue running trade deficits so the world can accumulate enough dollars to create liquidity.

The bigger question is what this says about the consumer. If people are pulling back on beer, even from a major player like STZ, does that mean discretionary spending is weakening more broadly?

The studio announced Tuesday that it had inked a deal with Microsoft-owned Activision to develop, produce and distribute a live-action feature film based on the first-person shooter game.

“As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty this is truly a dream come true,” David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, said in a statement. “From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love.”

Paramount and Activision said they will honor the brand’s “rich narrative and distinctive style” for fans of the video game franchise. Call of Duty has been the best-selling video game series in the U.S. for 16 consecutive years, with more than 500 million copies sold globally.

“I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand,” Ellison said.

The deal is yet another major announcement from Paramount since it officially merged with Skydance in early August. Weeks later the studio announced it had signed The Duffer Brothers, the creative team of Matt and Ross Duffer who created Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” to a four-year agreement for feature films, television and streaming projects.

Paramount also bought the U.S. rights to UFC in a $7.7 billion, 7-year deal that starts in 2026.

Ellison said in an open letter shortly after the merger that the company would invest in “high-quality storytelling and cutting-edge technology” to help “define the next era of entertainment.”

1n6lf3n,2025-09-02,2025-09-02 10:44:17,Warren Buffett says he is ‘disappointed’ in Kraft Heinz split; shares fall 5%,"Warren Buffett told CNBC on Tuesday that he is disappointed in the Kraft Heinz split that unwinds much of the blockbuster merger he masterminded a decade ago.

With a 27.5% stake in the company, Berkshire Hathaway is Kraft Heinz’s largest shareholder. The firm has not touched its shares since the 2015 merger that formed the food conglomerate.

Shares of the company fell more than 3% following Buffett’s comments.

Buffett told CNBC’s Becky Quick on Tuesday that the merger didn’t turn out to be a brilliant idea, but he does not think that taking the company apart will fix its problems.

Greg Abel, who will take reins at Berkshire Hathaway from Buffett at the end of the year, expressed disappointment to Kraft Heinz, according to Buffett.

Kraft Heinz did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Buffett’s stance on the deal.

The split announced earlier on Tuesday once again separates Kraft Heinz into two companies: one focused on sauces, spreads and shelf-stable meals and a second that includes North American staples like Oscar Mayer, Kraft singles and Lunchables.

Berkshire Hathaway teamed up with private equity firm 3G Capital in 2015 to merge Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. 3G Capital quietly exited its Kraft Heinz investment in 2023, after years of periodically trimming its stake as the company struggled.

Though it holds a roster of iconic brands like Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, Kraft Heinz saw its U.S. sales slip just a few years after the merger. Health-conscious consumers were buying less packaged food and shopping more around the perimeter of the grocery store. Some analysts also blamed the company’s slump on cost-cutting measures that kept Kraft Heinz from investing in its brands at a time when they needed it most.

In an effort to turn around the business, Kraft Heinz sold off some of its portfolio, like Planters nuts and some of its cheese division. The company has also been investing in some of its brands, like Lunchables and Capri Sun. In May, Kraft Heinz executives said that the company was weighing strategic changes and potential transactions.

Even as other investors have lost faith in Kraft Heinz, Buffett has stood by the company.

Regarding Berkshire’s future as a Kraft Heinz investor, Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire will do whatever is in the best interest of the firm. If Berkshire is approached to sell its shares, the firm will not accept a block bid unless other shareholders receive the same offer, according to Buffett.

With Tesla in the midst of a multi-quarter sales slump due to competition from lower-cost Chinese competitors, an aging lineup of electric vehicles and Musk’s incendiary political rhetoric and involvement with the Trump administration, the world’s richest person has been trying to convince Wall Street to look to the future.

For Tesla, that dream revolves around a world filled with robotaxis and humanoid robots, powered by artificial intelligence.

“It is important to note that Tesla is by far the best in the world at real-world AI,” Musk said in the company’s second-quarter conference call with analysts in July.

The problem for Tesla is that it’s behind in those key markets.

In robotaxis, Tesla has only recently started tests in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, while Alphabet’s Waymo is live in numerous markets and reached 10 million paid trips in May. Baidu’s Apollo Go is live in China.

Meanwhile, competition in humanoid robots is coming from the likes of Chinese companies like Unitree, which won multiple medals at the World Humanoid Robot Games. Others in the space include Boston Dynamics, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, 1X and Figure.

Musk said in March that Tesla plans to make 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year. In its first-quarter shareholder deck, Tesla said it was on target for “builds of Optimus on our Fremont pilot production line in 2025, with wider deployment of bots doing useful work across our factories.”

Tesla recently lost the person running the division.

Milan Kovac, Tesla’s vice president of Optimus robotics, announced his departure in June after nine years at the company.

Tesla is developing Optimus with the aim of someday selling it as a bipedal, intelligent robot capable of everything from factory work to babysitting.

Summary by Bloomberg Al

■ President Donald Trump has asked the US Supreme Court to allow him to immediately fire top officials at two independent agencies.

■ The case is testing a 90-year-old Supreme Court ruling that lets Congress shield high-ranking officials from being fired by the president.

The outcome could determine whether Trump has the power to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and could also impact the job security of other agency officials.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said appeasement will only embolden the “bully” at a BRICS meeting, rallying the group of emerging-market nations to fight back against US levies.

China’s top diplomat warned countries against caving into US tariff threats, as the Trump administration hints at the possible use of new trade tools to pressure Beijing.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said appeasement will only embolden the “bully” at a BRICS meeting, rallying the group of emerging-market nations to fight back against US levies. The stern remarks show China intends to resist pressure to enter trade talks even as US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggests Washington could ban certain exports to China to gain leverage.

Wang’s call to the international community underscores China’s attempt to portray itself as the bastion of free trade as US tariffs threaten to reshape commerce globally. Beijing has repeatedly urged allies to defend multilateralism and told other governments not to cut deals with the US president at China’s expense. China has repeatedly denied being engaged in trade talks with the US. Instead, Beijing has demanded mutual respect and a cancellation of all tariffs before any negotiations.

I wonder how Trump is going to respond to this. Maybe another 500% tariffs on China? Including this and GDP data this Wednesday, market is going to get rekt. Get your lubes ready.

This isn’t a dip. It’s not a correction. It’s the slow, brutal unraveling of a debt-soaked fantasy we’ve been pretending was sustainable since 2008. The Fed is cornered—rates are high, inflation refuses to die, and there's no bailout coming this time. The only soft landing is for the billionaires with parachutes made of your 401(k).

Tech is imploding under the weight of hype and weak fundamentals. AI was a sugar high. Now we’re crashing. Banks are getting shaky. Commercial real estate is a time bomb. And consumers? They're maxed out, broke, and paying 29% on credit cards to buy gas and eggs.

And just when we needed stability, we get chaos: Trump’s back in the mix with unhinged tariffs, trade wars 2.0, and economic policies that look like they were scribbled on a napkin in a Denny’s at 3 a.m. Markets hate uncertainty—guess what? That’s all we’ve got now.

This isn’t a crash. It’s controlled demolition with nobody at the controls.

Sell, don’t look back, and maybe plant a garden. We had a good run.

 President Donald Trump said he was watching volatility in the bond market in recent days and appeared to indicate that it was among the factors that led to his decision to institute a 90-day pause on some tariffs.

“I was watching the bond market. The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it’s beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,” he said.

CNN reported prior to the president’s decision that US Treasury yields had risen in recent days as investors sold off bonds. The benchmark 10-year yield Wednesday morning was 4.4% – up from 3.9% before Trump unveiled his tariffs.

Trump also said he watched JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Fox Business Network this morning.

The CEO “made the statement to the effect that something had to be done with the tariffs and trade. … He understood it,” Trump said. “It wasn’t sustainable what was happening. Somebody had to pull the trigger. I was willing to pull the trigger.”

During that appearance, Dimon warned that a recession was a “likely outcome” of the escalating trade war resulting from Trump’s tariff policies.

“No one’s wishing for (a recession) but hopefully if there is one it’ll be short,” he said. “I do think fixing these tariff issues and trade issues would be a good thing to do.”

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries extended heavy losses on Wednesday in a sign investors are selling even their safest assets as a global market rout unleashed by U.S. tariffs takes an unnerving turn towards distress and a dash for the safety of cash.

""This is beyond fundamentals right now. This is about liquidity,"" said Jack Chambers, senior rates strategist at ANZ in Sydney.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, the globe's benchmark safe-haven anchor, was up 20 basis points and rising in Asia - a remarkable move in a time zone where it's usually fairly steady.

At 4.46% the yield is up 59 basis points from Monday's low, with traders saying hedge funds were the heaviest sellers as they started to be forced from leveraged bets that in calmer times profit from small gaps between cash and futures prices.

""This kind of thing becomes problematic if the prime broker starts saying that now ... I want to charge you a higher margin or I basically want more margins from you,"" said Mukesh Dave, chief investment officer at Aravali Asset Management, a global arbitrage fund based in Singapore.

Thirty-year U.S. yields spiked 24 bps to 4.9553% and the three-day move in yield - if sustained - would mark the heaviest selloff in the long end since 1981.

Selling was heavy in Japan and Australia.

So basically we are going back to the stone ages tomorrow. This is much much worse than you think...

1jpgdmv,2025-04-02,2025-04-02 00:32:37,"US tourism officials sound alarm, tourist flights to US sink 70% and could impact up to 140k hospitality jobs and $14B in economic spending","Here is my way of trying to find alpha in an erratic stock market - how I'm trading the US tourism dip.

**1. Canada is the US's largest source of tourism**: In 2024, 20 million Canadian tourists visited the US, spent $20.5 billion, and supported 140,000 US jobs. Canada's population is 40 million, so 50% of the entire country visited, and the US had 77 million tourists so 1 country is contributing 26% of visits.

**2. Recent US policies is leading to a tourism boycott from Canadians, and the rest of the world**: Tourists are boycotting US tourism due to tariffs, annexation threats, new travel barriers, and stories of visitors being unlawfully detained with no due process (in March a Canadian citizen was denied entry due to an expired visa, while this was a worker and not a tourist, instead of being allowed to return to Canada, as is the norm, she was shackled in chains and sent to a private ICE facility for 2 weeks without being able to contact a lawyer or get a bed).

**3. Analysts previously predicted policies would decrease tourism by 5%, new numbers released this week show that it's 14x higher:** For Canada alone (26% of US's entire tourism industry with 20 million visitors) - airline travel is **down** **70%**, land travel is **down** **45%**, and **85%+** of tourists survey say they cancelled their US trips.

**4. Here's how I'm planning on using this information to make stock trades into specific companies both long and short:** I'm shorting airlines that have high exposure to Can-US routes (it's been reported that airlines are slashing these routes due to 0 demand, and they is no clear way they can cover this revenue gap with a lower utilized fleet). I'm shorting select hospitality chains (hotels, restaurants) with high exposure/retail foot print in US states that border Canada like Niagara Falls. The US travel association says that even just a 10% dip in tourists will lead to $2 billion in economic losses and 140,000 jobs at risk (assuming 70% decrease from air travel happens across the board, that's $14b), I expect hospitality to have lower revenues. I'm shorting all non-essential or higher price retailers with a big footprint in hostility states, all these workers being laid off by lack of tourism + the gov worker job cuts won't have as much to spend (not my specific trade, but an example would be short Target, long Dollar General).

I'm long, and buying, non-American/Europe hotel chains and travel booking platforms that get most of their revenue outside the US, as I expect Canadian and international tourists to concentrate their spend to Europe/Asia/Oceania travel this summer.

**Edit 5. How do the European/International figures play?**

It's important to note that the Canadian tourism numbers dipped after the policies that happened in point 2. And we're seeing what those numbers are a few months later now. The US admin is rolling out these policies across the board tomorrow during ""Liberation Day"". The point here is that we won't see the true vector of an internal tourism boycott both in terms of magnitude and direction until the policies that were enacted on Canada are enacted globally, and consumers have time to adjust behaviour. But if the Canadian consumer is any indication, I have more conviction in my trades. **A glimpse into this being a trend is a French travel company reporting to Bloomberg their Europe to US travel bookings are down 25%.**

**Edit 6. Example of the airline play**

Yes I know US airlines are already down a lot. Rode that wave and exited my shorts. Now I'm shorting Air Canada and ONEX (parent company of WestJet), since they have much more exposure to US-Can routes, and are cutting routes dramatically with no increase in capacity elsewhere

Also looking to short airline maitence companies, the food suppliers specific to flight food, and fuel refineries/storage those two airlines use, and retail stores with large exposure to airports that only see US/Canada travel.

But going long on regional air craft hangers since their smaller fleets are used the most for US/Canada travel, while their bigger fleets will still be active for the europe/asia flight routes that havn't seen impact on demand.

Would like to hear what everyone thinks about this trade play. Thanks!

1ibkcex,2025-01-27,2025-01-27 16:16:38,"Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history","Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.

The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. 

Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”

The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”

But after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.

Data center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.

For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.

Nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.

CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.

The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.

“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.

Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

1k5g9yj,2025-04-22,2025-04-22 16:13:09,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.” The company said this “dynamic,” and “changing political sentiment” could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.

Tesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany’s far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company reported a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.

Tesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet’s Waymo. The company has promised to launch its first driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June.

The company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a “pilot launch” in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.

Operating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.

The company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.

Energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is “creating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.”

Tesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said “increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.”

President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would impose 25% tariffs on “all cars that are not made in the United States.”

Trump said in the Oval Office that there is “absolutely no tariff” for cars that are made in the U.S.

Trump on Monday had hinted that the auto tariffs could arrive prior to April 2, the day his sweeping “reciprocal tariff” plan is set to begin.

“We’ll be announcing that fairly soon over the next few days, probably, and then April 2 comes, that’ll be reciprocal tariffs,” he said at a Cabinet meeting.

Trump has long signaled his plans to impose heavy tariffs on foreign trading partners. But his unpredictable and frequently shifting policy rollouts have stirred turmoil in the stock market and left business leaders uncertain about how to plan for the future.

Trump has hyped April 2 as “liberation day” and “the big one.” His plan, as originally described, would slap reciprocal tariffs on all countries that have their own import duties on U.S. goods, while also imposing tariffs in response to other disfavored trade policies, such as the use of value-added taxes.

But Trump and his officials have recently suggested that the tariffs coming April 2 could end up being softer than they first appeared.

Trump said Friday that “there’ll be flexibility” on those tariffs, and on Tuesday night suggested the duties will be more “lenient than reciprocal.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that countries can pre-negotiate with the U.S. to avoid facing new tariffs on April 2.",11298,157,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jkn9bk/trump_announces_25_tariffs_on_all_cars_not_made/,year,Unknown,0.95

It's concerning when fast food and retail businesses start seeing contracting sales from the US consumer. Especially staples that are concerned with affordability like Walmart and McDonalds. If Consumers are pulling back spending on ""cheap"", low cart value items like a McDonalds meal then it signals to me a budget constrained, worried consumer who won't spend on higher price discretionary categories like electronics, home reno, travel, etc.

The flip side of this - other fast food companies like Domino's have been doing fine. So maybe this is also a combination of McDonald's price hikes, lack of promotions, declining affordability, and increased competition. It could be both the macro and the company specific issues that created this result.

Hats off to the administration for this AMAZING accomplishment. It takes coordinated ineptitude to pull this off and the administration delivered it in spades.

To be clear, this is not the end of the world. The world is fine and it is not going to implode. I live in Asia and although people here do expect a recession, they are not running around with their hair on fire.

However, the US exceptionalism and the dominance of the US dollar are very likely to end, as declaring trade war against the entire world, ignoring court orders and attacking the independence of the central bank are all very stupid things to do.

1jwsz9l,2025-04-11,2025-04-11 11:43:29,The US bond market is continuing to crash. Will this make Trump back off of China?,"Bond yields peaked right before Trump paused his tariffs. Trump himself even said he paused because the bond markets were getting “yippy” and lots of sources say the bond market crash was his main reason for the pause. 

Today bond yields have spiked just as high as they were when Trump enacted his 90 day pause. He clearly cares about this measure given the action he took a few days ago. Could this continued sell off on bonds cause Trump to back off of China? 

According the the FT, ten minutes ago, talking about bond yields today: “They point to a complete loss of faith in the strongest bond market in the world.”

I know I’m the one who asked the question, but in my opinion it seems like there’s a decent chance this will cause Trump to back off, because otherwise this will lead to a much larger crisis, with the U.S losing its reserve currency status and the debt becoming more expensive than whatever we may generate from tariffs. He already backed off once for the same reason….

This guy in here is saying how it’s all smart and trump is trying to do a 20% cut on purpose. He was saying we need to bring these manufacturing jobs here, and said yeah we need to make tires here! I’m not an expert but I’m fairly sure the US has almost no rubber plantations or manufacturing. 

On top of the other issues like the fact that who the fuck would want to work at a rubber plantation? Then he was saying that hopefully all this manufacturing will be back in the US before the tariffs affect prices! 

He was saying that almost all brake fluid is made in the USA which idk how true that is but sounds false, not to mention it doesn’t ask the question of where do the plastic containers or aluminum containers it’s stored in come from? Not to mention the many other auto parts that aren’t made here and won’t be made here.

He is a normal mechanic in a swing state, just seeing the opinion of the everyday person shows me how deep people are into this and they will not accept that this isn’t part of a master plan in their favor. 

I also notice he keeps talking about the “trillions” of dollars that are going to be invested in this country like they would see any of that. It’s just proof that trump announcing these investments literally works perfectly to placate many.

#Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants

###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won’t be easy.

> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”

> Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.

> “We have more demand from across Europe,” says Mathias Nöbauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “Some customers were very explicit,” Nöbauer says. “Especially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.”

> “It's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans’ perspective—that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says Joakim Öhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. “Those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.”

> Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, Öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.

> Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company’s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. “First and foremost, it’s about values,” Cottlehuber says. “For me, privacy is a right not a privilege.” Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. “The best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers’ privacy is respected and preserved,” Cottlehuber says.

> Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always “been a must,” but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. “Since the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,” Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to Nöbauer’s Exoscale.

> Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is “not accurate” that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. “Our customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,” Straight says. “AWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.” Staight says the membership of the PCLOB “does not impact” the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has “additional safeguards for cloud content.” Google and Microsoft declined to comment.

> The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. “We can certainly feel that something is going on,” Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has “beaten” the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. “This is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,” he says.

> While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small—at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services—such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing—from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. “What happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,” he says.

> For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon’s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.

> “If you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you’ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,” says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer “safe” for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can’t properly compete. “We sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,” he says. However, that too could change.

> Schaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. “The dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,” Schaake says. “The idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.”

U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday ordering the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments to create a sovereign wealth fund and said it may purchase TikTok.

""We're going to stand this thing up within the next 12 months. We're going to monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters. ""There'll be a combination of liquid assets, assets that we have in this country as we work to bring them out for the American people.""

Trump had previously floated such a government investment vehicle as a presidential candidate, saying it could fund ""great national endeavors"" like infrastructure projects such as highways and airports, manufacturing, and medical research. 

Details on how exactly the fund would operate and be financed were not immediately available, but Trump previously said it could be funded by ""tariffs and other intelligent things."" Typically such funds rely on a country's budget surplus to make investments, but the U.S. operates at a deficit.

There are over 90 such funds across the world managing over $8 trillion in assets, according to the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds.

TikTok, which has about 170 million American users, was briefly taken offline just before a law requiring its Chinese owner ByteDance to either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19.Trump, after taking office on Jan. 20, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law.

(Reuters) - Tesla faces a proposed class action claiming it speeds up odometers on its electric vehicles so they fall out of warranty faster, saving Elon Musk's company from having to pay for repairs.

The plaintiff Nyree Hinton alleged that Tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and ""predictive algorithms"" rather than actual mileage driven.

He said the odometer on the 2020 Model Y he bought in December 2022 with 36,772 miles on the clock ran at least 15% fast, based on his other vehicles and driving history, and for a while said he drove 72 miles a day when at most he drove 20.

Hinton, a Los Angeles resident, said this caused his 50,000-mile basic warranty to expire well ahead of schedule, leaving him with a $10,000 suspension repair bill that he thought Tesla should cover.

""By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely,"" the complaint said.

Tesla and its lawyer did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment, but have denied all material allegations in the lawsuit. The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office.

Hinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show.

Tesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city.

The automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges.

In March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action.

The case is Hinton v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 25-02877.",8742,330,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k1p0mo/tesla_speeds_up_odometers_to_avoid_warranty/,year,Company News,0.98

1ih5a12,2025-02-03,2025-02-03 19:52:24,"Because I work for a big Wall Street firm, I'm limited on what I can write here.  But here's a story you may enjoy.","As mentioned, I've been w/a big Wall Street firm for decades, which means that I have a lot of restrictions on what I can write publicly.  But pretty sure this story is fine, since the company is long gone.

An old, but true, story.  It is represents much of what I went through in the late 1990s, in the midst of the dot com bubble.

eToys was an online toy retailer that did an IPO in January 1999 for $20 per share.  By the end of the day, it closed at $76 per share.

I received a call from a client, who was probably in her late 70s at the time.  She mostly bought blue chip stocks, utility stocks, preferreds, and tax-free bonds.

The conversation went something like this...

Client: SJ, I want to buy a stock.

Me: OK, what are we looking at?

Client: It's called eToys.  They sell toys online.  They are going to be the next Toys R Us, only bigger!

Me: (Looking things over)

Me: You know, they did their IPO at $20 and the stock is now at $80?

Client: I know, they're doing very well!

Me: The stock is doing very well, but I'm not sure that the company is doing too well.  They are new and unproven and they don't have anything resembling a profit or net income.  Why do you want to buy this thing?

Client: My son-in-law recommended it.  He is a very smart young man!

Me: Well, he may be smart, but I also know that son-in-laws can get you in a lot of trouble.  How many shares are you considering?

Client: I want to buy 1,000 shares!

Me: That's $80,000! (A lot of money now, but really a lot back in the late 1990s).

Client: I know.  I have a lot of confidence in eToys and in my son-in-law!

Me: Can I talk you out of buying this stock?

Client: No, I've made up my mind.

Me: Are you open to a compromise?

Client: What do you have in mind?

Me: Instead of buying 1,000 shares of eToys, let's buy 50 shares instead.

Client: 50 shares?  But that's only $4,000!

Me: I know, but I'll feel a lot better watching you lose $4,000 than I would if you lost $80,000.

(Long pause)

Client: Ok, do it.  Buy me 50 shares of eToys!

I bought the shares, the company went bankrupt, and she lost all of her money.  But again, a $4,000 loss beats the heck out of an $80,000 loss!

1kovw6j,2025-05-17,2025-05-17 11:39:13,Trump tells Walmart to 'eat the tariffs' instead of raising prices,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Walmart should ""eat the tariffs"" instead of blaming duties imposed by his administration on imported goods for the retailer's increased prices.

His comments were in response to the world's largest retailer saying this week it would have to start raising prices later this month due to high tariffs.

""Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,"" Trump said in a social media post.

""Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' and not charge valued customers ANYTHING.""

A representative of Walmart could not be immediately reached for comment.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday the retailer could not absorb all the tariff costs because of narrow retail margins. Even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise - which primarily comes from China - would not drive food prices higher.

Many U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of friction between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China, as consumers curtail spending.

As a bellwether of U.S. consumer health, Walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low.

Every week, some 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a Walmart.

Walmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that Amazon planned to disclose how much Trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products. The White House blasted Amazon over the report, which the company promptly denied.

(Bloomberg) — President Donald Trump would put the credibility of the dollar on the line and destabilize the US economy if he fired Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, French Finance Minister Eric Lombard warned.

“Donald Trump has hurt the credibility of the dollar with his aggressive moves on tariffs — for a long time,” Lombard said in an interview published in the La Tribune Dimanche newspaper. If Powell is pushed out “this credibility will be harmed even more, with developments in the bond market.”

The result would be higher costs to service the debt and “a profound disorganization of the country’s economy,” Lombard said, adding that the consequences would bring the US sooner or later to talks to end the tensions.

Lombard’s comments come after Trump, frustrated with Powell’s caution to cut US interest rates, posted on social media Thursday that Powell’s “termination couldn’t come quickly enough.” It wasn’t clear whether he meant he wanted to fire Powell or was eager for the end of his term, which is May 2026. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday Trump was studying whether he could fire him.

President Emmanuel Macron has opposed Trump on a series of issues including Ukraine, trade and even offered refuge in France for US-based scientists whose federal research funding has been cut.

Even so, Lombard’s comments are unusually direct about US domestic matters.

On tariffs, France’s finance minister said the 10% tariffs Trump has imposed on imports from the EU don’t constitute “common ground” and that Europe’s goal is for a free trade zone with the US.

The 10% level is “a huge increase that isn’t sustainable for the US economy and represents major risks for global trade,” Lombard said.

The finance minister also called on European CEOs to show “patriotism” and work with their governments so the region doesn’t lose out.

On Thursday, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, whose group LVMH owns Champagne labels like Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot as well as Hennessy Cognac, seemed to suggest that EU leaders weren’t pushing hard enough for an accord on tariffs.",8260,415,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k36tep/firing_powell_would_hurt_the_dollar_and_us/,year,Broad market news,0.96

The announcement reflects a firm stance from Beijing amid elevated trade tensions.

Chinese officials have also denied that any current negotiations are taking place, despite recent comments from U.S. leadership suggesting progress. In addition to reiterating their demand for tariff removal, China has introduced new export restrictions and initiated cases at the World Trade Organization.

Tariffs between the two countries now reach as high as 145% on U.S. imports from China and 125% on Chinese imports from the U.S.

>President Donald Trump President Donald Trump said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

>“We’ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.

>“Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,” he said.

>West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day’s high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.

>Trump indicated the 25% rate could represent a floor, saying that the tariff levels “may or may not rise with time.”

>But the US president did suggest he was still considering if one significant import — oil — would be exempted. Trump said would be making a determination as soon as Thursday evening, basing his decision upon the price of oil.

>“We don’t need the products that they have. We have all the oil that you need. We have all the trees you need,” Trump added, referring to major imports from Canada.

>Trump’s move was closely anticipated by markets as well as global business and political leaders who have scrutinized his words and actions for any indication on whether the US president would deliver on his levy threats or use them as the starting point for negotiations on trade.

>Trump in recent days threatened and then pulled back on tariffs against Colombia in a dispute over deportations of undocumented migrants, leading some to speculate that he was using trade levies merely as leverage to seek policy concessions.

>Trump also indicated that he would proceed with tariffs on China. He didn’t specify the levy, though he’s previously said it would be 10%. Trump has said Beijing failed to follow through on promises to prevent fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly drugs from flowing into the US.

>“With China, I’m also thinking about something because they’re sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they’re causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,” Trump said Thursday. “So China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we’re in the process of doing that.”

>Trump has ordered his administration to investigate whether China complied with a trade deal struck during his first term, setting the stage for tariffs against the world’s second largest economy.

>Following through on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, who are US neighbors, major trading partners, and export markets, threatens to have dramatic economic consequences, rattle markets and potentially launch a trade war by undermining protections from a three-nation free trade agreement.

>Both countries have pledged to respond to any trade levies, including with retaliatory tariffs, even as their leaders sought to assure the US they were addressing border concerns in a bid to defuse the conflict.

>“If these tariffs go into effect, Canada will respond,” Canadian Ambassador to the US Kirsten Hillman said Thursday. “This is not something that we want to do. We do not want to get into a tariff-back-and-forth with the United States. It’s not good for Canada, Canadians and Canadian workers and it’s not good for the United States, Americans and American workers.”

>Hillman said that Canada has responded to Trump’s concerns about the border by clamping down and announcing new security measures, including added drones and helicopters.

>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort even before the president was inaugurated in a bid to ease tensions between their nations, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke to Trump to try to avert the levies.

>In the first 11 months of 2024, US trade with Canada totaled $699 billion and $776 billion with Mexico. And the magnitude of tariffs Trump will enact could have stark impacts on particular industries, such as the auto industry and the energy sector. Shares of US automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. turned negative on the announcement, erasing earlier gains.

>“President Trump’s tariffs will tax America first,” Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. “From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose.”

>Trump is also promising sectoral tariffs, such as on pharmaceuticals, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum and copper, which could apply widely to many countries, including Canada and Mexico.

>The US president is an avowed believer in tariffs, saying they will force a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, though industry groups warn that it will upend supply chains and endanger existing factories by raising costs of source materials.

>He’s hailed tariffs as a source of revenue as lawmakers move to renew and expand expiring tax cuts and approve other credits and benefits the president promised on the campaign trail.

>On April 9, financial markets were going haywire. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick wanted President Trump to put a pause on his aggressive global tariff plan. But there was a big obstacle: Peter Navarro, Trump’s tariff-loving trade adviser, who was constantly hovering around the Oval Office. 
> 
>Navarro isn’t one to back down during policy debates and had stridently urged Trump to keep tariffs in place, even as corporate chieftains and other advisers urged him to relent. And Navarro had been regularly around the Oval Office since Trump’s “Liberation Day” event. 
>So that morning, when Navarro was scheduled to meet with economic adviser Kevin Hassett in a different part of the White House, Bessent and Lutnick made their move, according to multiple people familiar with the intervention.
>
>They rushed to the Oval Office to see Trump and propose a pause on some of the tariffs—without Navarro there to argue or push back. They knew they had a tight window. The meeting with Bessent and Lutnick wasn’t on Trump’s schedule.

>The two men convinced Trump of the strategy to pause some of the tariffs and to announce it immediately to calm the markets. They stayed until Trump tapped out a Truth Social post, which surprised Navarro, according to one of the people familiar with the episode. Bessent and press secretary Karoline Leavitt almost immediately went to the cameras outside the White House to make a public announcement. 

So the Liberation Day steep tariff percentages were only put on a 90-day pause because Navarro was in a different room on that April 9th morning

In the most completely politically agnostic way, their DEI stance really hurt the brand and store traffic. They had previously faced issues from store thefts, bloated inventories and declining sales as shoppers switched to more cost friendly retailers. And this was all before tariffs took center stage. 


Now Target has cut their 2025 forecast as revenue decreases and in store shopping drops. Adjusted earnings also came in notably lower. Target CEO avoided saying whether prices would increase because of tariff pressures, but the headwinds continue to mount. 


A few brighter spots are growing digital sales and increased same day delivery. Both full year revenue and earnings have been adjusted down and Target has created a new initiative to address the challenges. But overall the macro environment and company specific challenges have beaten down Target badly.

1j437g9,2025-03-05,2025-03-05 08:35:50,Trump Calls for End to $52 Billion Chips Act Subsidy Program,">President Donald Trump called for ending a bipartisan $52 billion semiconductor subsidy program that’s spurred more than $400 billion in investments from companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp.

>“Your Chips Act is a horrible, horrible thing,” the president said in a prime-time address to Congress on Tuesday. Trump implored US House Speaker Mike Johnson to get rid of the legislation and use “whatever is left over” to “reduce debt or any other reason.”

>His remarks were met with applause in a chamber that passed the Chips and Science Act less than three years ago. Vice President JD Vance, whose home state of Ohio won a massive Intel project thanks to the law, stood up to show his support for its revocation.

>The Chips Act is among the most significant US forays into industrial policy in more than a generation. It set aside $39 billion in grants — plus loans and 25% tax breaks — to revitalize American semiconductor manufacturing, as well as $11 billion for chip research and development. The aim was to reduce reliance on Asia for electronic components that power everything from smartphones to massive data centers.

>Trump, however, has consistently derided a program he regards as a waste of government funds, arguing tariffs would achieve the same outcome while filling coffers. Republicans have also indicated that they want to repeal what they see as “social” provisions of the Chips Act. That could involve eliminating labor-friendly regulations or environmental requirements.

>Officials on both sides of the aisle have touted the Chips Act as crucial to US national and economic security, and Trump could have a hard time getting congressional support to repeal it. Dozens of GOP lawmakers voted for the measure, and many red districts have won factories or other projects supported by the law.

>That includes South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., which have committed to multibillion-dollar projects in Texas and Indiana that were contingent on funding and support from the US government. Company representatives declined to comment on the president’s remarks.

>Trump, favoring tariffs over incentives, has signaled that import levies on chips could come as soon as next month. Companies can avoid those duties, he has said, by building factories on American soil. He has not offered additional details.

>On Monday, Trump credited the tariff threats for TSMC’s decision to invest $100 billion in the US, on top of a previous $65 billion commitment. He touted that project in his address Tuesday, referencing the full $165 billion figure. “We’re giving them no money,” Trump said. “All that was important to them was they didn’t want to pay the tariffs.”

>A TSMC spokesperson declined to comment.

>The company originally announced plans for a $12 billion US site during Trump’s first term and expanded that project to three factories under Biden. To support those facilities, TSMC struck an agreement with Biden officials for $6.6 billion in Chips Act grants and $5 billion in loans.

>As is the case for other Chips Act awards, the funding is supposed to be disbursed over time, as TSMC hits negotiated project milestones. The company received $1.5 billion before Biden left office.

>Trump did not specify whether he would attempt to claw back money that’s already been disbursed, renege on remaining incentives to which the government has already committed, or simply not provide additional support for the chipmaker’s latest investment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Monday that the newly announced projects — three additional chip plants, plus R&D and advanced packaging sites — won’t win federal funds.

>“The main uncertainty is the future of TSMC,” said Xin-Yao Ng, an investment director at abrdn plc. “One long-time competitive advantage was their clustering in Taiwan, where labor costs are still reasonable, construction costs are cheaper, government is supportive, and they can find more workers with vocational training. It’s completely different in the US if they are to shift more manufacturing. Subsidies from US were to be crucial to help mitigate some of the higher costs and challenges.”

>TSMC is among 20 companies that reached binding Chips Act agreements with Biden officials. The deals, which represent more than 85% of the manufacturing incentives available under the program, are designed to support leading-edge facilities by companies like TSMC, Intel, Samsung and Micron Technology Inc. — as well as older-generation factories by the likes of GlobalFoundries Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.

>Companies have generally viewed those agreements as ironclad — regardless of who’s in office. But some of them have worried that the Trump administration could seek to modify the terms, Bloomberg has reported. Lutnick has said he cannot commit to honoring existing contracts without reviewing them first.

>That review is ongoing, and Lutnick’s intentions for the initiative remain unclear. So far, his questions to program staff have focused on the rationale behind award decisions and the government’s legal authority to claw money back, Bloomberg has reported. The current Chips Act team, meanwhile, has been preparing a list of potential adjustments to the funding application process and final contracts that would be minimally disruptive.

>A spokesperson for GlobalWafers Co., which won $406 million from the Chips Act for factories in Texas and Missouri, said the Taiwanese company is committed to its expansion strategy and views any changes to the Chips Act as “unlikely.”

>But if the law were to be modified in some way, the spokesperson said, “we would reassess future investments, including evaluating US market demand, pricing, and potential tariffs if production were moved outside the US.”

**My take:** Brutally bad for semiconductor sector if CHIPS is actually repealed, INTC is especially targeted. There'd be less semiconductor manufacturing in the US (INTC/TSM/Samsung) primarily because we subsidize and have tax incentives for current US chip manfacturing projects, and companies that haven't received their funding will likely scale back projects [(remember INTC delayed their Ohio plant to 2028?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0cq51/intel_delays_28_billion_ohio_chip_factory_in_new/). The US would also be far more dependent on semiconductor production overseas. 

This also has spillover into the quantum computing stocks (IONQ/RGTI) and AI sector due to the sectors being so reliant on technological development and supply from the semis sectors.

Overall don't think new tariffs are going to be an adequate replacement for what the US has committed so far (but we don't know much about  the tariffs yet), and the markets hate uncertainty.

Expect impact on airlines, hotels, retail, restaurants","Today the Trump administration announced new visitation barriers for Canadian tourists. Any tourists staying longer than 30 days must register and provide fingerprints to authorities. How many Canadians actually vacation longer for 30 days+ in the US you may ask?

* **1 million snowbirds (Canadian tourists** travelling to the US to avoid Canadian winters) reportedly **contributed $6.5b** to Florida's economy **during just a 6 month period** (typical duration of their stays)
* **Canadians were the largest visitors to the US** comprising of **\~30% of all US tourist visits** in 2023.
* Those tourists with billions in combined disposable income just had it harder to come to the US to spend their money
* While this policy in isolation may not have a material impact, combined with instigating a trade war and threats of annexation seemed to have turned off many Canadians (rightfully so) on spending a single penny in the US.
* Since Canada was the only country previously exempted from this rule, reversing this is policy is leaving many Canadians feeling further alienated by the US, especially given their economic contributions to local US economies

I'm bearish for Q2, Q3, and potentially Q4 for the following industries

* **REITs**: NNN REIT, Drop in tourism will bankrupt many small US businesses with thin margins in the restaurant industry. While you can't make investment moves on small businesses, this will lead to defaulting on their leases and commercial REITs that focus on restaurants will have high vacancy rates.
* **Travel Bookers**: Expedia? Not sure how much of their revenue concentration is based on US bookings vs. global
* **Hotels:** Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Air Bnb, Caesars Entertainment
* **Airlines:** American, Delta, United, Air Canada,
* **QSRs:** Darden Restaurants, Texas Roadhouse, Brinker International (food chains primarily with US locations attract tourists due to the novelty factor of not being able to go in Canada)
* **Amusement Parks**: Disney, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, United Parks & Resorts
* **Car Rentals:** Enterprise, Hertz, Avis
* **Retail**: TJX Companies, Ross, Macys, Kohls, Target (retail stores with no presence in Canada are often attract tourists who are interested in shopping at retail stores they can't back in Canada)
* **Energy**: Shell, Chevron, Exxon (lots of Canadian tourists do road trips and gas up in the US, but since these companies also operate in Canada and Canadians are just going to replace their US road triups with Canadian ones, I do not believe they will be impacted

Other factors to consider before making moves

* Can US consumer spending or tourists from other countries fill the economic void Canadian tourists will leave in the tune of billions of dollars?
* Will other countries follow suite, either as a response to the US administrations polices, or in a sign of solidary with Canadians?
* Even if positive relations are restored between US-Canada by the end of the year, will that change souring Canadian consumer sentiment to US businesses and travel?

Edit: In no way is this post a dig at Canadians for deciding to stop visiting. I am also Canadian. This post is a purely from a finance/stock perspective on which industries will get negatively impacted by this administrations policies the most so that people here can adjust their portfolio allocations accordingly if they have exposure into said industries. Vive la Canada!

""I've heard [Mattel] said: 'Well we're going to go counter, we're going to try going someplace else,' "" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""That's OK, let him go, and we'll put a 100 percent tariff on his toys, and he won't sell one toy in the United States, and that's their biggest market."" Trump's threat to Mattel comes as toys—in particular dolls—have emerged as a flashpoint in the ongoing debates over tariffs and his administration's trade policy.

> Trump and his cabinet have downplayed the issue's significance, with the president himself repeatedly stating that girls will be better off for having fewer dolls, and now threatening tariffs on one of the world's most iconic doll manufacturers.

> During the company's first-quarter earnings call, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said the tariff-driven price hike was one of the three ""mitigating actions"" the company had been forced to take in response to the tariffs, alongside a reduction in its dependence on China-sourced products and a broader diversification of its supply chain. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Kreiz was asked whether it would be cheaper to relocate some manufacturing to the U.S. due to the tariffs, but responded: ""We don't see that happening."" ""We believe that production in other countries—where we can be efficient and more productive—is the best balance between manufacturing outside of the U.S. and [continuing] to develop product in terms of design and creativity in America,"" he said. In response to the price increases, and similar announcements made by car manufacturer Ford this week, Trump said: ""I think they're saying that just to negotiate deals with me.""

> Trump's remark on Mattel ""trying to go somewhere else,"" and the resulting threat of a targeted, 100 percent tariff on its toys was somewhat ambiguous, given the company has only advocated shifting more of its manufacturing outside of China.",6095,612,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kiu8i8/trump_has_threatened_to_place_a_100_tariff_on/,year,Unknown,0.95
1k1anog,2025-04-17,2025-04-17 07:41:11,Global investors are dumping a record amount of American stocks,"Danielle Kaye of the New York Times reports on a recent Bank of America survey that shows global investors have dumped a record amount of U.S. stocks in the past two months. Trump insists that the U.S. has been bringing in $2 billion a day in tariffs, some of which he claims comes from his new levies, but, in fact, Lori Ann LaRocco of CNBC reported today that U.S. Customs and Border Protection says the U.S. is taking in only $250 million a day.

Leila Fadel of NPR reports that China used to buy more than half the U.S. crop of soybeans and now soybean farmers are gravely concerned they’re going to lose that market. At the same time, we are heading in the prime months for the U.S. tourism industry, and Bloomberg reports that a worst-case scenario by the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates that the U.S. could lose almost $90 billion as foreign tourists stay away from the U.S. and boycott American products.

According to Fox Business reporter Edward Lawrence, “White House Press Secretary says 104% additional tariffs went into effect at noon Eastern time because China has not removed its retaliation. The 104% additional tariff will be collected starting tomorrow April 9th.”
The steep new tariffs follow President Trump's threat last week to impose punitive measures if China didn’t roll back its retaliatory 34% tariffs. Beijing refused, prompting a response that significantly raises the stakes in a trade standoff already rattling global markets.

China’s Commerce Ministry called the move “a mistake on top of a mistake” and vowed to “fight to the end.”

Trump's announcement was light on details. It did not say whether the duties will target films on streaming platforms and those shown in theaters, nor did it specify if the tariffs will be calculated based on production costs or box office revenue.

Streaming pioneer Netflix could particularly be at risk, as it relies on its global production network to produce content for international audiences. Its shares slumped 4.9% in premarket trading, leading a slide in media stocks.

> The U.S. dollar ended the first half of 2025 with its biggest loss since 1973. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies of the U.S.’s major trading partners, fell about 11% from January through the end of June.

1j9mlkx,2025-03-12,2025-03-12 11:26:21,Tesla investor survey shows 85% believe Elon Musk’s politics are having ‘negative’ or ‘extremely negative’ impact on company,"More than eight out of every 10 respondents to a Morgan Stanley survey believe Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s controversial political activities are hurting his business.

In total, 85% of the 245 participants polled by the firm believe Musk’s foray into politics has either had a “negative” or “extremely negative” impact on business fundamentals. The majority of respondents also expect Tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey.

While a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he’s become a rising figure in international and American politics. It also comes at a pivotal point for Tesla’s stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year.

When asked about Musk’s efforts with U.S. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a “negative” effect on the company. Another 40% said they were having an “extremely negative” impact.

On the other hand, 3% said they were “positive” for the business. Meanwhile, 12% called them “insignificant.”

To be sure, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. He also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of Tesla stock. The survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on Tuesday afternoon.

Jonas also asked about expectations for the company’s performance. In a separate question, 59% said they anticipated Tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. What’s more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. That comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent reports of vandalism could spook potential customers.

Just 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years.

Musk’s political profile has grown after his public support of President Donald Trump in the runup up to last year’s election and his subsequent role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla executive’s efforts to slash the federal government’s spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly.

Musk acknowledged in an interview with Fox Business on Monday that his high-profile role in Trump’s administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include X and SpaceX, “with great difficulty.” That day, Tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their worst session since 2020.

Despite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate Tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. Around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220.

After a New York Times report last week unearthed criticisms of Musk’s team from members of Trump’s cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on Tuesday. Trump evaluated five Tesla models parked at the White House after the president said on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support.

Trump also said he would declare violence at Tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism.

* Dalio said the fallout from turmoil in bonds could be a more severe shock to the monetary system than the 2008 financial crisis.

Bridgewater founder [Ray Dalio](https://www.cnbc.com/ray-dalio/) said on Sunday that he is worried that the turmoil resulting from [President Donald Trump’s](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) tariff and economic [policies](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/13/trump-commerce-chief-says-not-like-a-permanent-sort-of-exemption-for-phones-computers.html) will threaten the global economy.

“Right now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession,” Dalio said on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” “And I’m worried about something worse than a recession if this isn’t handled well.”

The hedge fund billionaire said he’s more concerned about trade disruptions, mounting U.S. debt and emerging world powers bringing down the international economic and geopolitical structure that has been in place since the end of World War II.

“We are going from multilateralism, which is largely an American world order type of thing, to a unilateral world order in which there’s great conflict,” he said.

Trump controls the SEC and DOJ, so who’s going to investigate or stop him?

Is it possible that Trump, his family, and billionaire buddies are benefiting from Trump’s tariffs?

Trump could be letting them know the date and time that he’s going to make the announcement to impose tariffs. Like many investors, they pull their investments but, they have a head start due to their insider knowledge. 

Then he lets those on the inside know that he’s going to rescind tariffs and the date and time which he will be announcing that.

Mr. Trump has not publicly talked about the effort since. But behind the scenes, officials have quietly put technological building blocks into place to enable his plan. In particular, they have turned to one company: Palantir, the data analysis and technology firm.

The Trump administration has expanded Palantir’s work across the federal government in recent months. The company has received more than $113 million in federal government spending since Mr. Trump took office, according to public records, including additional funds from existing contracts as well as new contracts with the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon.

President says Washington lacks capacity to strike deals with every nation

Donald Trump has held out the prospect that the US will set new tariff rates on many of its trading partners unilaterally, rather than striking deals with all of them.

Speaking at a meeting with business executives in the United Arab Emirates on Friday, the US president said that Washington would impose new tariffs “over the next two to three weeks”.

He added that Treasury secretary Scott Bessent and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick would “be sending letters out essentially telling people” what “they’ll be paying to do business in the United States”.

Trump said that, while “150 countries” wanted to agree deals, “it’s not possible to meet the number of people that want to see us”.

1k2ys45,2025-04-19,2025-04-19 11:25:48,The era of American stock market exceptionalism is over,"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/american-exceptionalism-over/?ICID=continue_without_subscribing_reg_first

Nearly three quarters of fund managers think that US exceptionalism has peaked. The prevailing trend of the last decade – a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions – is over, according to the Bank of America’s latest survey.
Over the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump’s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.

While it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn’t the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.
Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall – a scenario today’s US market is particularly vulnerable to.
One of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.

Since 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc – over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.

Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: “Technology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.”
However, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026.

The upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500’s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025.

All of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past.
In fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform.
Markets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market.
Mr Gimber explains: “One of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running.
“This has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.”

1k5789e,2025-04-22,2025-04-22 10:08:48,Bloomberg: Markets are Discovering that the Real Trump Trade is Sell America,"Two months into Donald Trump’s second term, the pillars of American financial hegemony — erected over the best part of a century — have rarely looked shakier.

Trump’s renewed tirades against the Federal Reserve, including the most explicit threats yet to fire Chair Jerome Powell, only amplified the shockwaves from his declaration of trade war on pretty much everyone. It’s forcing a reappraisal of the assets fundamental to US economic dominance. The dollar and Treasury bonds, traditional havens at times of stress, suddenly look much less appealing. It’s not long since investors were anticipating a so-called Trump trade, essentially turbocharging US exceptionalism, but now it looks more like a sell-America trade.

And that’s just part of an even broader and likely painful shift. The role of US households as goods-buyers of last resort for the global economy, and the American military as linchpin of security and political alliances, are being called into question too.

Compounding the concerns, Trump is now escalating his war of words against the Fed, demanding immediate interest-rate cuts. Lawyers doubt he’s authorized to fire Powell. But the damage to investor confidence in the central bank’s independence — part of the bedrock appeal of US markets, along with a wider faith in the rule of law — may already be done.",4724,295,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k5789e/bloomberg_markets_are_discovering_that_the_real/,year,Broad market news,0.95

The tariffs aim to encourage more chip production in the US, with Trump criticizing the CHIPS and Science Act for providing funds to companies that already have significant resources. The policy may cause price hikes for various computer products, as it takes years to build chip factories. TSMC-made chips are typically not exported directly to the US, but rather sent to other countries for assembly into consumer electronics. The implementation of such tariffs will depend on US trade officials.

1k5bi48,2025-04-22,2025-04-22 13:03:00,Schumer says Democrats will force Senate floor vote on Trump tariffs,"

From: https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/schumer-says-democrats-force-vote-end-trump-20286193.php 


ALBANY — Democrats plan to force a floor vote in the U.S. Senate next week to reverse recent tariffs imposed by President Donald J. Trump on imports from other countries. 

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer told reporters in Albany Monday that he thinks Democrats can secure the four Republican votes necessary for the resolution to pass.

“American families, restaurants and manufacturers will be able to breathe a sigh of relief if we can get that done,” Schumer said.
A similar resolution sponsored this month by U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, wound up passing the Senate after four Republicans crossed party lines to support it. Schumer is trying to repeat that result.
The resolution would reverse the blanket 10% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S. by ending the emergency declaration Trump has issued to impose them. It would also prevent Trump from using the same declaration to impose new tariffs.
“We believe the administration’s claim of an emergency is not justified,” Schumer said.
But the harder fight — and one in which Schumer has no control — is in the House of Representatives, where a majority of lawmakers would have to approve the resolution for it to become binding.
Republican leadership in the house, including Rep. Elise Stefanik from the North Country, has made clear that they don’t plan to stand in the way of Trump’s tariffs. Some lawmakers have offered support for his economic strategy.
The goal of the tariffs is to pressure other countries into trade agreements more favorable to the U.S. while providing a disincentive for consumers to purchase products imported from other countries.
“I strongly support President Trump’s America First economic policies to strengthen American manufacturing and create millions of American jobs,” Stefanik said earlier this month.

Stefanik is one of seven Republicans that represent New York in the House, where Republicans currently hold a seven-member majority.
Schumer employed a strategy on Monday that’s been used by several other Democrats from New York in recent weeks to apply pressure to Republicans, framing them as the final arbiters on whether prices will climb because of tariffs.
He called on the Republicans representing New York in Congress to bring his planned resolution to the floor of their chamber for consideration.
“If those seven went to (House Speaker Mike) Johnson and said to put it on the floor, he’d be under real pressure to do it,” Schumer said.

But at least one Republican is siding with Stefanik on Trump’s tariffs. Rep. Mike Lawler has said that Republicans are focused on other actions to lower costs as well, like removing regulations for businesses and boosting domestic energy production.
“This is about leveling the playing field, bringing tariffs down across the globe,” Lawler said in a televised town hall earlier this month.
That makes Schumer’s request unlikely at this point, leaving the tariffs in place. They’ve already started to have an impact on certain industries, including restaurants, which may have to raise their prices to maintain profits.
“Tariffs on food and beverages will place an additional strain on restaurants, ultimately leading to higher prices that will be passed on to consumers,” said Melissa Fleischut, president of the New York State Restaurant Association.

Other industries also haven’t been immune to the tariffs. That includes Latham Pool, a local business that happens to be the largest manufacturer of in-ground residential pools in North America. 
Tariffs on aluminum and steel have had the most impact on the business, said Scott Rajeski, the company’s CEO.
“We’ve created an ecosystem where we use the Canadian operations and our upstate New York operations to ship goods back and forth between the two countries,” Rajeski said. “It’s a difficult situation.”

Both chambers of Congress are scheduled to return to Washington, D.C., next week after two weeks off from session.

President Donald Trump’s administration exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs, potentially cushioning consumers from sticker shock while benefiting electronics giants including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.

The exclusions, published late Friday by US Customs and Border Protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump’s 125% China tariff and his baseline 10% global tariff on nearly all other countries.

The exclusions would apply to smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips. Those popular consumer electronics items generally aren’t made in the US. Setting up domestic manufacturing would take years.

The products that won’t be subject to Trump’s new tariffs also include machines used to make semiconductors. That would be important for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has announced a major new investment in the US as well as other chipmakers.

The tariff reprieve may prove fleeting. The exclusions stem from the initial order, which prevented extra tariffs on certain sectors from stacking cumulatively on top of the country-wide rates. The exclusion is a sign that the products may soon be subject to a different tariff, albeit almost surely a lower one for China.

One such exclusion was for semiconductors, to which Trump has regularly pledged to apply a specific tariff. He hasn’t yet done so but the latest exclusions appear to correspond with that exemption. Trump’s sectoral tariffs have so far been set at 25%, though it’s not clear what his rate on semiconductors and related products would be.

Gross domestic product, a sum of all the goods and services produced from January through March, fell at a 0.3% annualized pace, according to a Commerce Department report Wednesday adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a gain of 0.4% after GDP rose by 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. However, over the past day or so some Wall Street economists changed their outlook to negative growth, largely fueled by an unexpected rise in imports as companies and consumers sought to get ahead of the Trump tariffs implemented in early April. Imports subtract from GDP.

# The Facts

* Longtime Tesla investor Ross Gerber on Wednesday publicly called for Elon Musk to step down as Chief Executive Officer, citing Musk's divided attention between Tesla and his role in the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as a special adviser in the Trump administration.
* In an interview, Gerber said Tesla is ""absolutely"" in crisis and has been ""neglected for too long."" He added, ""It's time for somebody to run Tesla.""
* Tesla's market value has decreased by more than $800B since December, with shares down over 50% from their peak. The electric vehicle maker is facing declining sales and increasing competition in key markets.
* In addition, the company is experiencing a nationwide boycott in reaction to Musk's actions with the administration. There have been incidents of vandalism at showrooms and charging stations, including Molotov cocktail attacks in Las Vegas and gunshots fired at facilities in Portland.
* Previously, Gerber's wealth management firm, which owned 262,352 Tesla shares as of February, began selling shares in 2023 as concerns mounted over Musk's leadership and Tesla's declining reputation.
* Multiple Tesla executives have sold over $100M worth of shares since early February, including James Murdoch's $13M sale and Kimbal Musk's — Elon Musk's brother — disposal of 75K shares worth approximately $27M.",3821,190,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jgl0wc/top_tesla_investor_demands_musks_exit_amid_stock/,year,Industry News,0.93

Costco Teamsters, the union with 18,000 employees for the retailer nationwide, said 85% of members voted to approve the action. The current contract between the Teamsters and the wholesaler is set to expire Jan. 31.

“Costco’s greedy executives have less than two weeks to do the right thing,” Sean O’Brien, general president of Teamsters, said in a statement. “If they refuse, they’ll have no one to blame but themselves when our members go on strike.”

A strike could hamper day-to-day operations at the well-known retailer. It could also impact public sentiment around Costco, which has become known for its positive treatment of workers and, more recently, as a defender of diversity and inclusion initiatives.

Teamsters will negotiate for a final week with Costco, the union wrote in an X post on Sunday. The union ran practice pickets in preparation for a potential strike last week in locations including San Diego and Long Island, New York.

The union said in a statement earlier this year that Costco rejected a proposal and called Costco’s counterproposal “insulting,” noting that it didn’t reflect the company’s “historic financial success” and offered no enhancement to retirement benefits.

“This strike vote is a direct response to Costco’s greed and blatant disregard for the bargaining process,” Tom Erickson, director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division, said in a press release. “Costco claims to treat workers better than the competition, but right now, it’s failing to live up to that reputation. Management has less than two weeks to fix this — if they don’t, they’ll face the consequences.”

Costco did not respond immediately to CNBC’s request for comment.

1iwft77,2025-02-23,2025-02-23 12:46:53,"Warren Buffett sounds warning to Washington as Berkshire reports record profit, cash","https://www.reuters.com/business/warren-buffett-says-us-should-spend-wisely-plans-increase-investment-japan-2025-02-22/?utm_source=reddit.com

NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""

Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.

The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.

He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly shown his ability"" to deploy capital.

""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.

Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.

Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.

Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.

Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.

""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.

'FISCAL FOLLY'

This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.

""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.

Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.

He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by ""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.

He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""

Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on people's ability to participate.

That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.

""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.
""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" he added.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.

Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.

Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.
The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.

Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.

""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.

Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.

Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""

The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.

""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.""

1jnlbkn,2025-03-30,2025-03-30 16:09:08,Trump aide says tariffs will raise $6 trillion as White House readies plan,"White House aide Peter Navarro claimed Sunday that President Donald Trump’s new tariffs would raise more than $6 trillion in federal revenue over the next decade, a figure that experts said would almost certainly represent the largest peacetime tax hike in modern U.S. history.

Appearing on Fox News, Navarro said the president’s tariffs on auto imports, set to take effect Wednesday, would raise $100 billion per year. Meanwhile, a regime of additional tariffs — details of which have yet to be released — would raise another $600 billion per year, or $6 trillion over the next decade, Navarro said.

Navarro’s remarks suggest Trump is preparing dramatic new measures for Wednesday, which the president has referred to as “Liberation Day.” Navarro is known to be among the most hawkish voices in the president’s inner circle on trade, and it was not immediately clear if he was speaking to official administration policy or for one side of an internal debate over the tariffs. But Navarro’s comments are sure to rattle markets amid intensifying fears about the global trade war that Trump’s tariffs have started.

Also speaking on Fox News on Sunday, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, declined to outline Trump’s plans. Hassett is widely regarded as more skeptical of tariffs than Navarro.

“I can’t give you any forward-looking guidance on what’s going to happen this week,” Hassett said. “The president has got a heck of a lot of analysis before him, and he’s going to make the right choice, I’m sure.”

Tariffs are taxes imposed on foreign goods imported into the United States. A tariff regime that generated $600 billion per year would amount to the biggest increase in federal tax revenue since World War II, according to Jessica Riedl, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a center-right think tank.

By way of comparison, the U.S. is set to spend roughly $900 billion per year on the Pentagon this year. Extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts is projected to cost roughly $4 trillion over the next decade, adding roughly $400 billion a year to the national debt.

Generating $600 billion a year in fresh revenue theoretically would cover the cost of those tax cuts and then some. But economists say new taxes of that magnitude also could deepen instability on Wall Street and further increase the risk of a U.S. recession, and experts are extremely skeptical the tariffs would raise as much as Navarro claimed.

The Trump administration argues that steep tariffs are necessary to bring production and manufacturing jobs back to the United States. “The message is tariffs are tax cuts. Tariffs are jobs. Tariffs are national security,” Navarro said. “Tariffs will make America great again.”

Navarro did not disclose details of the additional tariffs coming Wednesday, but Trump [has in recent days revived the idea](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/29/republicans-trump-tariffs-trade-war/?itid=ap_jeffstein_2) of imposing a single universal rate on all imports to the United States, regardless of the product or the country of origin. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump proposed setting this flat tariff rate as high as 20 percent.

Because the U.S. imports more than $3 trillion worth of goods per year, simple math suggests that a 20 percent import tax on all goods could raise close to $600 billion in annual revenue. However, economists argue that such a tax ultimately would raise far less because the costs would be passed on to American consumers in the form of higher prices and consumers would therefore purchase fewer imported goods. In an interview with NBC on Saturday, Trump nodded to this effect, [saying](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/29/trump-auto-tariffs-prices-rise/) he “couldn’t care less” if his auto tariffs raise prices, because higher prices on imports would encourage people to buy American-made cars instead.

A universal flat tariff has been heavily criticized by economists in both parties, who argue that it would raise prices indiscriminately, striking even some goods — such as food and cheap consumer electronics — that either cannot be produced in America or make little sense to produce domestically.

This month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent outlined a more moderate approach to “Liberation Day” that calls for the United States to determine a new tariff policy for its each of its key trading partners, leaving room for negotiations and dealmaking. But Trump has told advisers in recent days that he is wary of being insufficiently ambitious with his tariff policy, and it remains unclear precisely what Wednesday will bring.",3530,423,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jnlbkn/trump_aide_says_tariffs_will_raise_6_trillion_as/,year,Broad market news,0.92

1mnlj21,2025-08-11,2025-08-11 14:47:48,Trump extends China tariff deadline by 90 days,"President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will prevent high U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from snapping back into effect for another 90 days, a White House official told CNBC on Monday afternoon.

The order was signed just hours before midnight, when the pause on Trump’s tariffs was set to expire.

The delay was the expected outcome from the latest round of talks between U.S. trade negotiators and their Chinese counterparts, which took place in Stockholm, Sweden, late last month.

Here’s the plot so far:

Trump announces tariffs Markets instantly go full anxiety mode. Stocks in that sector? Dumped. Volatility? Exploded. Retail? Shaking. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, rumors swirl that his inner circle is buying the dip like it’s Black Friday at Walmart.

Fast forward to today:

He pauses the tariffs for 90 days.

Like… bruh.

The very thing that nuked the market — he just casually hits the snooze button on it.

And what happens? Shorts get evaporated.

Retail FOMOs back in.

And the cycle begins again.

So the question is — **what the hell happens after the 90 days**?

Do the tariffs come back like a sequel no one asked for?

Is this just a ploy to pump positions and then rug pull again?

Or is it just Trump being Trump, dropping chaos into the economy like it’s his side hustle?

And seriously — **what’s the endgame after 90 days**? Do the tariffs come back harder than ever? Or does this quietly disappear once the cameras shift back to the campaign trail?--> Make (people) losers again",3394,570,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jvcaia/trump_announces_tariffs_stocks_drop_buys_stock/,year,Unknown,0.96

Recently disclosed text messages reveal that Elon Musk tried to sway Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund—commonly known as the Oil Fund—to support his controversial Tesla pay package. The fund, which manages assets of around USD 1.8 trillion and holds a significant stake in Tesla, voted against Musk’s compensation proposal, prompting him to admonish CEO Nicolai Tangen not to request any “favors” until making amends.

In their exchange, Musk also accused Tangen of leaking the texts to the media, after Norwegian outlets reported on his canceled dinner appearance at the Oil Fund’s investment conference. Tangen countered that Norway’s strict transparency laws, akin to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, required partial disclosure, including confirmation that Musk would not attend.

Initially, the Oil Fund classified much of the conversation as private and withheld it. However, in the spirit of transparency, they eventually released all texts. The incident highlights the tension between Musk’s calls for discretion and the Norwegian Oil Fund’s legal obligations to remain open. While emphasizing a positive relationship with Tesla as a critical investment, the fund has reiterated its opposition to Musk’s pay plan.",3387,186,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ic2lgt/elon_musk_tried_to_pressure_norways_wealth_funda/,year,Unknown,0.95

1inb7p0,2025-02-11,2025-02-11 17:20:13,TSLA isn't the NVIDIA of EV's anymore,"

I’m no Tesla expert, and I’m sure plenty of people know way more about the company than I do, but I wanted to throw out some thoughts and see what you all think.



Right now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags:



📉 Shrinking Profit Margins – Tesla’s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.



🏴‍☠️ Musk’s PR Nightmare – Elon literally gave a “Sieg Heil” on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That’s… not exactly great for brand reputation.



🚗 Cybertruck is a Mess – Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it’s basically a meme.



🌍 New Political & Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation.



🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress.



🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.



What do you guys think? Am I being too bearish, or is Tesla in for some rough times ahead?",3354,601,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1inb7p0/tsla_isnt_the_nvidia_of_evs_anymore/,year,Unknown,0.89
1ik4nfq,2025-02-07,2025-02-07 15:21:19,Chinese Markets are Rejecting Tesla,"Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is slipping, and nowhere is that more obvious than in China. According to a new report from CNBC, Tesla’s sales in China dropped 11.5% this January compared to the same time last year. With China setting the pace for the global EV industry, Tesla is rapidly losing ground to local giants like BYD.

It’s not just a sales dip, it’s a wipeout. In January, BYD sold 30% more EVs than Tesla worldwide. The reason? Cost and variety.

While Tesla leans on price cuts to compete, Chinese brands like BYD are already priced lower from the start. Tesla’s profit margins, once its strong suit, are shrinking fast, while BYD keeps scaling production without sacrificing profitability. The Model 3 and Model Y Tesla’s core models are struggling to hold their own against a flood of cheaper, high-tech, government-backed alternatives.

For years, Tesla thrived under China’s policies that welcomed foreign EV makers. That era is over. The Chinese government has made it clear, they want their own brands to lead the global EV race. Companies like BYD, Nio, and XPeng are now the priority, while Tesla is increasingly seen as an outsider.

Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory, once a strategic advantage, is now a vulnerability. The Chinese government could tighten regulations, cut subsidies, or tilt the playing field even further in favor of domestic competitors, any of which would weaken Tesla’s foothold even more.

Elon’s strategy of constant price cuts has helped sustain demand, but the latest 11.5% sales drop suggests the approach is losing its effectiveness. Cutting prices again and again doesn’t build brand loyalty.. It signals that demand is slipping.

And Tesla can’t keep squeezing its margins forever. The competition isn’t slowing down it’s accelerating.",3345,367,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ik4nfq/chinese_markets_are_rejecting_tesla/,year,Company Discussion,0.94

“We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC.

The company reported better-than-expected results and an upbeat quarterly forecast in late April.

Microsoft had 228,000 employees at the end of June, meaning that the move will affect thousands of employees.

It’s likely Microsoft’s largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. In January the company announced a small round of layoffs that were performance-based. These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said.

One objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said.

On Monday, Microsoft shares stopped trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. They closed at a record $467.56 last July.

It is unclear whether Trump will go beyond haranguing Powell to try to fire him. Powell would likely fight such an action in court. Investor faith in the U.S. could also be shaken. Monday’s slump in stocks and the dollar and rise in bond yields might be a foretaste.

That prospect has some Republicans warning Trump against threatening to oust the Fed leader.

“The president has already created tremendous uncertainty concerning international trade policy, forcing every business in America to figure out what his policies are,” said Gramm, who chaired the Senate Banking Committee from 1999 to 2001. “Suggesting that Powell could be removed through presidential action creates a whole new uncertainty.”

Even if Trump doesn’t ultimately oust Powell, his efforts to discredit him could do lasting harm to an institution that has long sought to remain apolitical and technocratic.  

“This is a real disaster” for the Fed, said Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania. “The very integrity and buy-in on a bipartisan basis that the Federal Reserve is going to be a straight shooter is what gives the Fed its authority, its maneuverability.”",3286,240,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k4x0id/trump_is_laying_the_groundwork_to_blame_powell/,year,Broad market news,0.97

scoring 100% on the human right campaign Corporate Equality Index, which has been described
as a woke credit scoring system that promotes transgenderism.""

concerns proponent raises about ESG, DEI, and transgenderism are isolated and merely
perceived by the proponent who happens to be a shareholder. Note, as just one example, the
growing list of companies and brands that have recently done an about face on one or more
of these issues. The fact that Coke can be so dismissive of these concerns is itself indicative of
the need for the committee and report the proposal requests.""

""Nearly all of

1jo91nk,2025-03-31,2025-03-31 13:37:52,Elon Musk says backlash against his DOGE government cuts is hurting Tesla stock,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Sunday that his involvement in the Trump administration could be hurting the automaker’s stock price.

Speaking at a town hall event in Wisconsin, Musk said his role with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency — which is pushing for widespread government job cuts — is creating backlash against his electric car company and hurting the stock.

“What they’re trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to ... stop doing this,” Musk said, according to Bloomberg News. “My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it’s a big deal.”

Shares of Tesla entered Monday already down more than 34% year to date, and the stock has been cut nearly in half from its peak in December. Shares were down an additional 6% in premarket trading Monday.

The drop for the stock could be a “buying opportunity” for the long term, said Musk, who was in Wisconsin ahead of a state supreme court election there. Musk has campaigned for the conservative candidate and spent more than $12 million on the race, in addition to giving $1 million each to two voters at Sunday’s rally for signing a petition against “activist judges.”

The slumping stock isn’t the only sign of public anger with Musk for his political work. Protesters demonstrated at Tesla dealerships over the weekend, and there have been reports of vandalism against vehicles and dealers across the country.

Musk’s role in politics is not limited to DOGE. He publicly campaigned with Trump in 2024 and has been a regular presence at the White House since the new administration took over in January. He also regularly comments on many different political topics on X, the social media company he owns.

The CEO’s rising political profile comes amid signs that Tesla’s core business is slowing. The automaker’s vehicle deliveries declined in 2024, and preliminary data has shown that sales are down again early this year, especially in Europe. In a note to clients Sunday, investment firm Stifel trimmed its price target on the stock and lowered its sales projections for Tesla.

Musk’s political dealings may not be the only reason for Tesla’s struggles. Other U.S. auto stocks have also labored in recent weeks, partly because of threats of higher tariffs on imported goods into the U.S. and retaliation from overseas trading partners, adding uncertainty to an industry whose supply chains are tightly woven among the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

1k8arnn,2025-04-26,2025-04-26 07:27:01,Ken Griffin criticizes Trump tariffs: says those jobs are not coming back,"From Bloomberg. Of course this Billionaire actively supported Trump and donated millions. Somehow he never heard Trump say over and over again that “the US was getting ripped off” and the best way to fight that was high tariffs? Trump has been saying this since the 1980’s when Japan was ascendant. 

“Citadel founder Ken Griffin extended his criticism of the Trump administration’s trade policy, saying that tariffs won’t bring back American manufacturing jobs the way that the president anticipates and the country should play to its strengths instead. 

“He dreams of giving people their dignity back, and I have to applaud him for having that dream,” Griffin, speaking Friday at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, said of President Donald Trump. The dream of creating more manufacturing jobs, however, “is not going to come true.”

“These jobs are not coming back to America,” Griffin said. “And to be clear, with an unemployment rate of 4%, America has moved on.”

The Citadel billionaire, who earlier this week said the trade war has devolved into a “nonsensical” place, has warned that the US is putting its global brand at risk as a result of the tariff policies. On Friday, he said the administration has embraced a transactional mindset that runs contrary to the best interests of the country. 

Speaking as part of Stanford’s “View From the Top” series in Silicon Valley, Griffin argued the US should try to play to its strengths, such as creating intellectual property and content, rather than bringing back jobs in factories that are rapidly automating their production anyway.

**My take:** This news was released at  around 8:51 AM PT. I watched VXX, (VIX ETF),  BABA, FXI, SPY, plus other trade war participants that would be most affected. Interested mainly in triple levered ETFs like UPRO or YINN at the open to see if there's more volatility coming in (which there likely will be). This is somewhat of an incremental headline because we've seen Trump announce tariffs before but we never knew if they were a bluff or not, but today's tweet might be confirmation that this is actually happening (unless yet again, this is a bluff).

The trade for most of these catalysts is mainly just waiting with your hands on the keyboard and waiting for most of these tweets and being quick on the draw. I traded when Trump was president back in 2016-2020 and read close to every tweet he made.

With everyone on one side of the boat does anyone think it’s possible that trump and his asset pumping / gas on the fire of animal spirits mentality will eventually cause a Chernobyl effect?? Could trump actually be the black swan that’s been right in front of our eyes all along? 

His tariff policies maybe, idk. It’s a tough thought to even consider because trump will not tolerate a down market during his presidency. But at the same time we’re probably 15T-20T more in debt than when he started in 2016 and rates/inflation are still very high. It’s a much different back drop from 2016. 

Trump has already made some sneaky comments preemptively blaming Biden for a crash, leads me to think maybe he’s somewhat concerned as well? 

In reality, I know stocks will go up no matter what. Really doesn’t matter who the president is. Just interesting to think about the thought of trump, the savior of the market and the economy, actually being the cause for its implosion. 🤔

1j2khkm,2025-03-03,2025-03-03 09:57:50,"Tesla sales plunges 70% in Norway, what might the future bring","Norway is a special market with almost 90% EV's with a market share of 18% for Tesla, so in other countries sales will most likely not decline as much in the same period since oversaturation is less of an issue. Norway can be a reference for other markets in the future but only if Tesla is able to clean up their reputation.

Since administration only started on the 21st, we will only see the real effect of decline in sales when numbers from March are published. Some other countries share car registrations which are from a time point a view much more reliable than sales, since it's unclear if this is about cars being delivered or ordered.

**Reasons of decline**

* (stronger) competition
* oversaturation of Tesla, people want to have another car as the rest
* customers possibly waiting for new Tesla Y 
* Musk

Although oversaturation is less of a risk in other countries, people still steer away from Tesla in favour of different, fresher designs. Tesla is focusing a lot on new tech gadgets/software, while their cars still almost look the same as many years ago.

**Conclusion and near future**

Although it's unclear if the numbers are deliveries or orders in February, we might see a further decline. People that  already decided to buy a Tesla are unlikely to cancel their order. In Norway we might see almost no sales anymore because until new Tesla Y rolls out. In other countries sales could plunge the same as in Norway.

If the decline of sales becomes a trend this will in the short term become a big logistic and manufactoring problem for Tesla. They'll have to start dealing with overstock, production might need to be halted since more production might just lead to more overstock.",3133,280,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j2khkm/tesla_sales_plunges_70_in_norway_what_might_the/,year,Unknown,0.94

**American Photonics** and **Novotech** to its export control list, banning exports of dual-use items to them.

**Shield AI** and **Sierra Nevada Corporation** were placed on the unreliable entities list, prohibiting all China-related trade and investment.

* **Shield AI** develops AI-powered autonomous systems for military drones. **Sierra Nevada Corporation** specializes in aerospace and defense tech.
* **American Photonics** makes precision CO₂ laser optics, while **Novotech** produces infrared optical materials. Both have dual-use applications in civilian and military sectors.

This could disrupt their supply chains as they rely on Chinese components (e.g., rare earths, specialty optics).

Aviation tracking site Flightradar24 said the plane was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, one of the most modern passenger aircraft in service.

The plane was headed to Gatwick Airport in the U.K., Air India said, while police officers said it crashed in a civilian area near the airport, without specifying whether there were any fatalities.

It was not immediately clear what caused the crash. Boeing said in a statement it was aware of initial reports and was working to gather more information.

The news comes as the planemaker tries to rebuild trust related to safety in its jets and ramp up production under new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Orthberg.

Boeing’s shares were down about 8 per cent at US$196.52 in premarket trading.

“It’s a knee jerk reaction (to the incident) and there’s revised fears of the problems that plagued Boeing aircraft and Boeing itself in recent years,” said Chris Beauchamp, analyst at IG Group.

Even with the Trump administration stating that they’re raising tariff rates on other 12 countries this week, the S&P 500 didn’t even decline a full percentage point. 

The markets current reaction to Trump revamping his tariff talk pales in comparison to the -7% decline after announcing his Canada and Mexico tariffs and the further -12% drop after liberation day. Financial markets have begun to largely ignore Trump and his tariffs, pricing in the expectation that he will ultimately chicken out. 

Here’s the thing: Trump always chickens out *because* of the markets reaction. Whether it was his first term tariffs in 2018 or his walk back of the liberation day tariffs or his eventual decision not to fire JPOW, he always chickens out because of the stock or bond market. 

When the markets stop caring about Trump’s constantly changing tariffs and assume everything will be all right in the end, that’s a **very bad** thing for America. If the market continues to rally based on bullish sentiment while ignoring the possibility that Trump actually keeps the tariffs this time, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. He will move on to destroying something else while the tariffs slowly increase inflation and suppress profits. Then, if earnings start coming in negative and the GDP shrinks, the market could crash again like on April 3rd.

(Quote)

Markets are trying to figure out the implications of upending this system. Here are four:

More expensive stuff, and less choice of stuff. Increasing saving means reducing consumption. The tariffs amount to the largest tax increase in decades, which counts as government “saving”—as well as pushing up the price for almost everything imported.

Higher interest rates. The capital inflows that offset the trade deficit help fund a big chunk of federal government borrowing. Slash the trade deficit and the net inflow of foreign money dries up. Bond yields will need to rise to attract domestic savers to buy Treasurys instead of stocks or corporate bonds, which will hit share prices and raise the cost of borrowing for companies.

Lower stock prices. Only a small chunk of foreign investments goes into building factories. If there were more foreign direct investment, it could finance at least some of the reconstruction of manufacturing. But we’ve assumed Trump succeeds in shrinking the trade and current-account deficits, so there will be less foreign money coming in (remember: balance). So more foreign factory building means less foreign buying of stocks and bonds, so lower stock prices.

A weaker dollar. In economic theory the dollar is the variable that moves when savings and investment don’t balance. If the U.S. saves too little to cover its investment, the dollar should weaken to make U.S. investments more attractive to foreigners.

In practice the dollar has been in demand for foreign reserves and for use in trade, as well as a safe place to stash the world’s savings. All three are now being questioned: reserve holders worry they could be cut off from their reserves the way Russia was, trade is likely to shrink thanks to tariffs, and investors are worried that U.S. law might no longer be the reliable protector of their assets.

He is Trump's new chief economic adviser. Guess what? The word ""tariff"" appears here 215 times. This is the plan. This paper establishes a regime where America is literally a global protection racket - ""pay up the tariffs or we throw you to the wolves.""

This has a tinfoil hat flavor to all this, but just yesterday Ezra Klein's new episode dropped with Gillian Tett, a Financial Times reporter, and it is ALL about the Mar-A-Lago Accord.

You are not crazy - they tried to impose tariffs on our allies, the allies balked, and now the crew is salty and disorganized. They don't know what to do. Hilariously, Miran predicted this himself (this is in the summary, p.37, read it):

>These policies may supercharge efforts of those looking to minimize exposure to the United States. Efforts to find alternatives to the dollar and dollar assets will intensify. There remain significant structural challenges with internationalizing the renminbi or inventing any sort of “BRICS currency,” so any such efforts will likely continue to fail, but alternative reserve assets like gold or cryptocurrencies will likely benefit.

Dionysis Partsinevelos at MSN breaks down the plan in a more terrifying detail, describing scenarios such as repricing Fort Knox gold (THAT'S why you've heard about it) and basically sabotaging the dollar and US bonds:

KEY POINTS:

Port of Los Angeles Sees a 35% Drop in Cargo Traffic: High tariffs on Chinese goods have nearly halted shipments from China, according to Port Executive Director Eugene Seroka. He projected a 35% decrease in cargo arrivals compared to the same time last year.

Ports Handle Over 30% of U.S. Container Trade: The Port of Los Angeles and the neighboring Port of Long Beach together process 31% of all U.S. shipping container imports and exports (17% and 14%, respectively), making their slowdown a critical national issue.

Wider Economic Fallout Includes Job Loss and Supply Chain Slowdown: 1 in 9 jobs in the Los Angeles region is tied to port activity. Experts estimate a 9-12 month long recovery if tariffs are reversed today. As maritime traffic and cargo volume decline, the trucking industry and broader supply chain are also slowing, threatening small businesses and consumer goods availability nationwide.

FULL ARTICLE:

By Juliette Kayyem

A drop in maritime traffic suggests that the worst is yet to come.

Stock markets plunged for days after President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on imports from around the world. The sell-off ebbed only when he suspended most, but not all, of the new measures for 90 days. The ticker tape is just one indicator of an economy, and other signs are growing more and more ominous—including at the Port of Los Angeles, where high tariffs on China are crushing maritime traffic. “Essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,” Eugene Seroka, the executive director of the port, said on April 24.

Trump views tariffs as essential to rebuilding the manufacturing economy that the United States once had. But his erratic tariff announcements have badly disrupted the economy that the country has today, and that pain is already being felt in the world of logistics.

“These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.”

The Port of Los Angeles, the busiest in the Western Hemisphere, processes about 17 percent of everything the United States imports or exports in shipping containers. The adjoining Port of Long Beach accounts for another 14 percent. Over the years, a whole ecosystem has arisen to support the loading and unloading of the cars, clothes, electronic gadgets, and other things that people want. There are workers and warehouses, trucks and loading pads, security structures and rail lines.
Seroka estimated that cargo arrivals would soon be down 35 percent over the same time last year. At the moment, the drop in traffic seems likelier to accelerate than to reverse. 

The number of cargo ships canceling port calls or entire voyages is on the rise. A number of shipments now under way were instigated before Trump’s so-called Liberation Day tariff announcement, on April 2. According to Forto, a cargo-management and -tracking company, reservations for shipping products must normally be placed two weeks before a cargo vessel launches. The trip from China from California typically takes two or more additional weeks. In other words, the full effects of U.S. tariff policies on maritime traffic may not be apparent for some time.

The economy, and the supply chains that allow it to function, can adjust fairly quickly to certain shocks, including weather disasters and even a pandemic. Early in the COVID shutdowns, toilet paper was in short supply as Americans spent more time at home and less at workplaces and schools. The problem eased as manufacturers ramped up production, transportation systems adapted, and consumer anxiety decreased.
But Trump’s trade war is different because it is unpredictable and indefinite. Even if he were to renounce tariffs tomorrow, Trump has already shaken global confidence in American economic-policy making. No one can comfortably make business decisions based on what he does. Unless the Republican-controlled Congress steps in to quickly take away the president’s ability to impose import duties at will, a failed effortso far, even foreign trading partners who believe they have a deal with the United States could be at risk of capricious new taxes on their products.

Tariffs don’t just reduce the flow of goods coming into the country; they also cause an atrophying of the logistics system that moves products into, out of, and around the United States. “Less cargo volume, less jobs. That’s the rule here,” Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach, said recently, describing how one in nine jobs in the greater Los Angeles region arises directly or indirectly from its ports. “Port complexes are like your baby toe on your foot,” Peter Neffenger, the former commander of the Coast Guard sector that includes Los Angeles and Long Beach, told me. “You don’t think about it until you break it one day and realize, ‘I can’t walk.’”

Like the shipping business into and out of Los Angeles, the nationwide trucking industry is slowing down, because drivers have a lot less cargo to move. Without inventory arriving or en route, small businesses will falter; bigger industries will shrink; shelves will be empty.
This week, Trump blamed former President Joe Biden, rather than his own policies, for the recent turmoil on Wall Street. What’s happening in Los Angeles suggests that, if anything, financial markets have yet to fully price in how much Trump’s tariff war is hurting the economy. The stock market goes up and down. Maritime indicators keep on sinking.

1nhnjwm,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 10:35:00,Trump advocates end to quarterly earnings reports,"President Donald Trump floated the idea Monday of companies no longer providing earnings report on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is “subject to SEC approval” and would “save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”

“Did you ever hear the statement that, ‘China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!’” Trump said.

The wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.

“In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” the pair wrote.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.

Supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.

Markets priced in the tarrif news, and then, as nothing truly new came in(no immediate negative effects) it's bouncing a little. Half thr country supports trump, and if they see no bad news they will be buying the dip. Then probably Thursday, if the Tarrifs stay at their current level we will probably dip again, then we will partially stabilize and go up a little again. And then we will start to see the negative effects of tarrifs come in and the negative effect of the American brand being thrown in thr trash

Come summer, higher prices will be seen, places that rely on tourism will be getting hit hard, food prices will be going up like crazy, and companies will start to suffer. And all for this will happen when the American people have less money in their pocket, and less abilty to buy. And this will not be just for the summer, this will be a continous effect for as long as the tarrifs are up. And for probably a good while after

1k2a5oh,2025-04-18,2025-04-18 13:11:38,Jay Powell made it clear Fed is not going to rescue markets,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jay-powell-made-it-clear-fed-is-not-going-to-rescue-markets-080051450.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jay-powell-made-it-clear-fed-is-not-going-to-rescue-markets-080051450.html)

Jerome Powell delivered a clear message to markets this week: I'm not coming to the rescue.

The chair of the Federal Reserve [used an appearance at the Economic Club of Chicago](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/powell-sees-challenging-scenario-for-fed-if-trump-tariffs-stoke-inflation-and-slow-growth-173002914.html) to say in no uncertain terms that investors shouldn't expect changes in interest rates anytime soon or any near-term intervention in the bond market following turmoil triggered by President Trump's tariffs.

The key moment came on Wednesday when professor Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business asked Powell if there was a ""Fed put"" in the stock market.

And Powell couldn't have been more explicit: ""I'm going to say no.""

Markets are ""struggling with a lot of uncertainty and that means volatility."" But his view is that markets are ""are functioning kind of as you would expect them to in a period of high uncertainty.""

That seemed to pour cold water on speculation that the Fed might step in to restore some calm in the bond market if needed.

The speculation ramped up last week as yields on long-term debt [soared](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bond-market-sell-off-severe-as-long-term-yields-notch-biggest-week-since-1982-170057642.html), prompting predictions the central bank would need to provide some liquidity as investors unwound positions.

Powell said those markets remain ""orderly"" and chalked up the recent turmoil to ""markets processing a historically unique development."" What also helped is that the bond market did settle back down this week, easing the pressure for immediate intervention.

This week Powell also disappointed investors — and a US president — hoping to hear signs he was ready to lower rates as a way of preventing a downturn or cushioning the inflationary effects of new tariffs.

The central bank will ""wait for greater clarity"" before considering any interest rate adjustments, he said, as he expects Trump's tariffs to generate higher inflation and slower growth.

Powell predicted a tough decision ahead for the Fed as it weighs both sides of its mandate for stable prices and full employment, saying there is a ""strong likelihood"" that the economy will be moving away from both of the Fed's goals for the ""balance of the year, or at least not making much progress.""

If anything, Powell went out of his way to hint he may give preference to controlling inflation, noting that without price stability, the Fed cannot achieve a strong job market for a long period. And he made it clear he wasn't yet sure whether the inflationary effects from tariffs would be temporary or long-lasting.

""Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,"" he said, but ""the inflationary effects could also be more persistent.""

Powell also underscored the Fed's obligation is to keep long-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent a one-time price increase associated with higher tariffs from becoming an ongoing inflation problem.

All of this seemingly hit a nerve with the president, who spent much of Thursday lashing out at Powell on social media and during a press event in the Oval Office.

""Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!"" the president wrote on Truth Social. Trump said Powell ""is always TOO LATE AND WRONG"" and should be cutting interest rates alongside other central banks.

At the White House later on Thursday, Trump reiterated he was ""not happy"" with Powell and that Powell would leave his position ""if I ask him to.""

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Trump has for months privately discussed firing Powell, but he hasn’t made a final decision about whether to try to oust him before his term ends in May 2026.

Powell has shown no signs of blinking. On Wednesday, he again reiterated the independence of his institution and his own job, saying it’s ""a matter of law,"" and pledged not to act in response to any political pressure.",2780,195,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k2a5oh/jay_powell_made_it_clear_fed_is_not_going_to/,year,Broad market news,0.98

KEY POINTS

The number of canceled sailings of freight vessels out of China is picking up as ocean carriers attempt to manage a pullback in orders due to the trade war and tariffs.

A steep decline in containers being shipped to the U.S. will have a big impact on the supply chain, from port to trucking, rail and warehouse economics.

“We won’t go to zero containers, but we will see a decrease in containers and as a result, in the future we will see a massive raft of blank sailings announced,” one freight expert tells CNBC.

The impact of the diminished freight container traffic to North America will be significant for many links in the economy and supply chain, including the ports and logistics companies moving the freight. If each sailing was carrying 8,000 to 10,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), that would equal a decline in freight traffic of between 640,000-800,000 containers, and lead to decreased crane operations at the ports, lower fees that could be collected, and declines in container pick-ups and transports by trucks, rails, and to warehouses for storage.

Booking volumes from the last week of March to first week of April across global and U.S. trade lanes plummeted. There were sharp decreases in bookings across several categories, including apparel & accessories; and wool, fabrics & textiles, both down over 50%. Major product categories from China that are moved in containers include apparel, toys, furniture, and sports equipment, all of which are subject to steep tariffs.",2762,263,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k3ddfi/cnbc_trade_war_fallout_cancellations_of_chinese/,year,Broad market news,0.97

1ji0n3r,2025-03-23,2025-03-23 10:35:01,"Tariffs, DOGE and Columbia — The market will crash because Trumpism is not capitalism","There is a lot of talk, in this subreddit and just about everywhere, about how the tariffs are going to affect stock prices. I think the bigger factor is that Trumpism is not capitalism. This government has asserted its right to cancel contracts and grants, and the right to use all means at its disposal to impose policy on non-government entities. One example: NIH grants have been canceled because they were interpreted (apparently by someone who probably did not even read them, and certainly doesn’t understand them) as being no longer in line with the priorities of this government. These are multimillion dollar projects on topics like cancer, autism and shingles. They were funded after a careful competitive review by scientists, and they were stopped after much of the money was spent. It’s half-finished bridges. You can no doubt provide many examples yourself. If you can’t, ask in the comments. My point here is that under Trumpism the government will abandon contracts at will, and will use the threat of cancellation to micromanage state and local government, and corporations. 

The cases of Columbia and Maine illustrate that this government has replaced the rule of law with rule by one man. In both cases, Trump asserted the right to dictate policy normally left to the University (regarding the limits of free speech on campus) or to the state (regarding trans-gender athletes), and found ways to enforce that. I don’t yet know of a case where this government directly managed a company, but I’m sure it will come; he has the tools (the threat of cancellation of government contracts, or exemptions from tariffs, to name two). The threat of arbitrary and capricious directives from this government, coupled with the inability to rely on contracts being honored, is going to destroy profits. Milton Friedman, the famed Chicago school economist, argued that democracy, economic freedom and the rule of law are essential for prosperity. We no longer have those things. Let me give you three examples. 

I have significant holdings in MRNA, Moderna. Their mRNA technology allows the rapid development of custom drugs, not only vaccines, but drugs to treat cancer and many other diseases. They demonstrated that they can deliver during the covid-19 pandemic, and many estimates hold that RNA vaccines saved over 10 million lives. This is a great American company, and it should be ascendent, but its stock price is currently beaten down by the reasonable expectation of politically based resistance to mRNA vaccines from the Trump administration. 

TSLA was one of last year’s magnificent seven and rose even higher when Trump was elected because of the expectation that the CEO Elon Musk’s close personal relationship with the president would pay off. Now, it has fallen along with Musk’s popularity. People realize that DOGE found precious little waste and fraud but compromised many valued functions of government. To my point here, the value of TSLA stock is entirely dependent on Trump’s continued favor. If there are many government contracts, it will probably recover. If there is a falling out after Trump finally finds it necessary to blame Musk for the obvious problems with DOGE, then it will not. In either case, this is not a free market. 

Finally, I want to mention Boeing. Trump personally announced on Friday that Boeing had been selected to build the F-47 jet fighter, a contract potentially worth $50 billion. So far so good, but he’s making it clear that he decides. I expect this contract to specify everything from who Boeing can purchase parts from, to DEI policies, to whether someone given the name Charles at birth can go by Chuck. 

Trumpism is government regulation on steroids.   ",2661,167,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ji0n3r/tariffs_doge_and_columbia_the_market_will_crash/,year,Unknown,0.88
1j09c5p,2025-02-28,2025-02-28 09:47:56,Skype to Shut 14 Years After Microsoft’s $8.5 Billion Purchase,">Microsoft Corp. is signaling the end of the line for Skype, the iconic internet calling and chat service it bought almost 14 years ago.

>Once a byword for digital calls that bypassed long-distance charges, Skype was surpassed in recent years by smartphone-native communication apps and Zoom video calls. When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to Slack Technologies Inc.

>Microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.

>“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.

>Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.

>Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.

>It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t. Microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which found itself in the Office division and under orders to build tools geared toward a workplace audience as well as a consumer one.

>By the time Slack arrived on the scene, Skype users were complaining that elements of the core experience had started to break down. They cited missed or phantom calls and failures to sync information on different devices. The company worked to improve the service’s reliability, but some loyal users were put off by frequent redesigns, including a short-lived effort to fashion Skype in the mold of Snapchat.

>Microsoft, which also saw its acquisition of Nokia Oyj’s mobile phone business end in failure, is far from alone in encountering rejection by a fickle consumer market. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has cycled through several iterations and brands for its online communications tools, which are today known as Chat and Meet. And this month, Amazon.com Inc. said it would be winding down Chime, the video and voice calling service it tried with little success to sell to corporate clients.

>The Windows maker is shuttering Skype to focus on developing new features for Teams, including artificial intelligence tools, Teper said. The company is working to infuse AI into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn’t part of that effort. It’s reassigning staff that had worked on Skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, Teper added.

>At one point, Skype played host to one of Microsoft’s biggest AI demonstrations: a real-time translator. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had nudged researchers to bring the product to market as quickly as possible and heralded it as “magical” in a 2014 demonstration early on in his tenure.

>Teams is “going well and this is a step to double down on it,” Teper said, adding that Microsoft wanted to keep Skype running until it was confident that the Teams version for individual users was fully ready. “It’s the most successful product in its category by far,” he said.

**My Take:** Thank god. ZM might stand to be a major benefactor from this. MSFT already has Teams that serves as a workplace call tool, but Skype has tried to expand into the workplace forum space (like Slack) and has failed. MSFT is citing this more as a doubling-down on Teams rather than admitting ZM has eaten their lunch here.",2655,303,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j09c5p/skype_to_shut_14_years_after_microsofts_85/,year,Unknown,0.97

It even passes out the post-Plaza Accord drop, which was intentional and coordinated. Keep in context that this is exactly a four month timeframe, but to be far that’s also because that’s literal present timeframe we have so far. 

Jan–Apr 2025	~10.8% - Trump’s tariffs and political pressure on the Fed, global de-dollarization concerns. 

Jul–Nov 1985	~10.2% - Post-Plaza Accord (U.S. and allies coordinated to weaken the dollar)

Sep 2000–Jan 2001 ~ 9.6% - Start of dot-com crash; capital fleeing U.S. tech bubble

Apr–Aug 2008	 ~ 8.8% - Global financial crisis buildup; Fed rate cuts and recession fears.

Apr–Jul 2020	~ 4.1%	- COVID-19 stimulus surge; fear of inflation and dovish Fed.

When COVID hit,  solution was massive money printing again.  
And it worked. Markets bounced back, the system didn’t collapse.

Now it feels like every crisis just leads to the same response: **Printing more money.**  
it’s become a habit. A learned behavior.

And honestly, the U.S. doesn’t even *pretend* to care about paying down its national debt anymore.  
They just keep rolling it over,, kick the can down the road.

Even this whole push for stablecoins feels like another version of **passing the burden forward** like a digital shell game to absorb more U.S. debt while buying time.

But at the end of the day, who pays for all this?

**Ordinary people who save money.**

  
People who saves consistently through diligently and honestly everyday are getting crushed.  
Just sitting still means your money loses value every year.

In a world of reckless money printing and wild inflation, the only real defense is **owning assets.**

Index funds, Big tech stocks, gold, crypto, real estate  
basically **anything they can’t print into oblivion.**

The gap between fiat currency and real assets is only going to get more extreme.  
And if someone's holding cash, he or she is already falling behind.

It seems that Trump is adamant on sticking it to Xi and waiting for his phone to ring, which we all know is not happening now that they stopped rare metal exports to the US.

He doesn't care he's being hunted down.

Also, to make this even worse, CPI will not come back good. The dollar index will continue to fall, exacerbated by China and other countries dumping US bonds. Currency devalue + tariffs will cause import costs to go up and push the cost onto the consumers, further raising CPI. It's a never-ending cycle.

Jerome will not be able to cut rates this year and I don't predict we see any serious rate cuts until Trump can force one of his WWE goonies into the hot seat at the FED on May 15th 2026.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Volvo Group plans to lay off as many as 800 workers at three U.S. facilities over the next three months due to market uncertainty and demand concerns in the face of President Donald Trump's tariffs, a spokesperson said on Friday.

Volvo Group North America said in a statement it has told employees it plans to lay off 550-800 people at its Mack Trucks site in Macungie, Pennsylvania, and two Volvo Group facilities in Dublin, Virginia, and Hagerstown, Maryland.

The company, part of Sweden's AB Volvo, employs nearly 20,000 people in North America, according to its website.

Trump has upended the global trading system that has been in place for over 75 years with a plan for tariffs on products from across the world. His vacillating trade policy has undermined consumer and business confidence, and caused economists to raise their forecasts for a U.S. recession.

Volvo Group's lay-offs are the latest response from a car and truck industry that is reeling from the Republican president's tariffs on certain parts, which is expected to increase the cost of manufacturing vehicles.

""Heavy-duty truck orders continue to be negatively affected by market uncertainty about freight rates and demand, possible regulatory changes, and the impact of tariffs,"" a spokesperson for Volvo Group North America said in an emailed statement.

""We regret having to take this action, but we need to align production with reduced demand for our vehicles.""",2411,214,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k2cly4/volvo_to_cut_up_to_800_us_jobs_as_trumps_tariffs/,year,Company News,0.98

KEY POINTS

Asset management firm Apollo Global Management (APO) forecasts trucking demand stopping in about a month resulting in empty shelves and a recession this summer as President Donald Trump's trade war policies are bringing about changes in global shipping not seen since the coronavirus pandemic, with ocean carriers readying for significantly reduced demand, according to analysts and observers.

Specifically in focus: U.S. trade with China, amid the back and forth over tariffs and possible deals. The uncertainty has led to a decrease in shipping volumes from China to North America, with cancellations currently at 50%, according to global logistics firm Flexport.

Trump announced his ""liberation day"" tariffs on April 2 and it takes about 20-40 days for container ships to sail to the U.S. from China, according to Apollo. Slok estimates that container ships coming to U.S. ports could come to a stop by mid May.

It then takes about 1-10 days of transit time for trucking/rail to bring goods from the ports to cities. Apollo Global Management predicts that by late May domestic freight demand will ""come to a halt"" and that there will be ""empty shelves"" with companies responding ""to lower sales.""

By early June, Slok forecasts there will be layoffs in the domestic freight and retail industries with a recession hitting the U.S. this summer.",2392,260,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1katckv/trump_trade_war_update_firm_predicts_empty/,year,Industry News,0.98

1. The market was well on its way to entering bear country, and a lot of short positions are sure to follow, particularly with firms that stand to lose the most with tariffs, such as AAPL.
2. Trump posts that ""now is a great time to buy,"" prompting retail investors to flood the markets with purchase orders in advance of an expected announcement, driving up prices and making those with short positions nervous.
3. The announcement actually happens, prompting even more retail investors to buy any large cap stock that sounds reliable (despite having done no prior analysis or thinking).  This drives up prices even higher.
4. Short sellers begin exiting their positions and buying more, driving up prices on everything, including those that would be expected to continue losing amid the China tariffs, such as AAPL.
5. Boom, near-record ""gains"" market-wide, even on stocks that should still be losing, confusing everyone.
6. The next day, those who took long positions exit to capitalize on their gains, resulting in a return to fair market value.

This was a disaster for a lot of people.  Short sellers lost their collective asses yesterday.  It was still a massive loss for investors overall.

My opinion (not financial advice): I'd be selling any position I didn't enter for the long term and exiting this market until calmer seas prevail.  This president has no idea what effects his words have on markets, and is causing havoc that he's not even aware of.

1jalltg,2025-03-13,2025-03-13 16:17:22,Stocks Tumble Into Correction as Investors Sour on Trump,"he world’s most widely followed stock-market benchmark slid into a correction on Thursday, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the Trump administration.

The move stems from investors’ growing pessimism about the whipsawing policy pronouncements from Washington over the past few weeks. On-again, off-again tariffs and mass layoffs of federal workers have fomented unease on Wall Street.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent. After weeks of selling, the index is now down 10.1 percent from a peak that was reached less than one month ago and is in a correction — a Wall Street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its peak, and a line in the sand for investors worried about a sell-off gathering steam.

Other major indexes, including the Russell 2000 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, had already fallen into correction before Thursday.

The deeper worry among investors is that uncertainty around the effects of Mr. Trump’s policies is causing consumers to spend less and discouraging businesses from investing. That reticence could, in turn, drive the economy into a downturn, forcing investors to re-evaluate company valuations.

“I think what markets are telling us is that they are very concerned about the potential for a recession,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “That is certainly not what markets expected going into 2025.”

So far, the administration has brushed off the market turmoil. Scott Bessent, secretary of the U.S. Treasury, said on Thursday that he was focused on the “real economy”, downplaying signals sent by business leaders and investors. “I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” he said.

As stocks have been falling in recent weeks, the Trump Administration has emphasized that its economic policies are designed to promote job growth over the long term, but could cause some market turmoil in the near term.

Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the economy has already begun to be “negatively impacted.”

The pain has been acutely felt among the behemoth tech companies that had driven the market higher in recent years but have since reversed course. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has fallen roughly 14 percent from its peak in December.

The sell-off has also spread to other corners of the market, signaling broader concerns than simply a re-pricing of highly valued technology companies. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are typically more exposed to the ups and downs of the economy, has fallen 18 percent from its peak in November, close to a fully fledged bear market, defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from its peak.

Sectors of the stock market exposed to tariffs, like food producers, have slumped. The effects are being felt on other companies, like airlines, that are worried about a pullback among consumers should the economy enter a downturn.

“So far in 2025, the U.S. economy has only faced headwinds,” Ms. Shah said.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on European wine and champagne, one day after the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. whiskey and several other American products. The president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from China.

The constantly moving goal posts have left investors so rattled that even recent good news about the economy hasn’t had a calming effect. On Thursday, a report on weekly unemployment claims came in lower than expected. On Wednesday, a better-than-expected reading of the Consumer Price Index had briefly helped bolster stocks.

Investors are worried that tariffs, once in full effect, will push prices higher — hurting business and consumers. Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and firings of federal employees through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are also looming in the backdrop, as is the threat of an impending government shutdown.

“The outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said on Thursday.

You still have the same amount of stock, the price just went up. Compounding to me would mean that they’re giving you more amount of stocks that you own? Or am I completely wrong?

Data centers powering AI models are already consuming huge amounts of electricity, and it’s only going to increase in the next few years.

I’ve been thinking about this from an investment point of view. By 2026, energy will probably be one of the most important sectors tied to AI growth. The question iswhich direction should we bet on?

Will you focus on clean energy and nuclear power, assuming governments and tech companies will push for greener solutions? Or will traditional fossil fuels still dominate because they’re easier to scale quickly?

But I also hold some money in Roth, and have some money coming into my traditional Ira soon, like this week. My Roth holds voo, schd, and a tiny amount of Amazon and meta. Don’t ask me why I started that way.

I’ve watched many videos on building a diversified portfolio and using ETFs like voo or schd for growth with moderate risk.

But I don’t feel I understand enough to invest the amount I have coming in and don’t want to lose out.

I understand to place stable and dividend paying stocks into traditional and high growth stocks into Roth. Is it that simple? Does anyone chase speculative stocks? How diverse should I be? When I think about gold, reits, and global stocks, I get scared honestly. It feels overwhelming as I like things simple and straight forward and am not familiar with those assets.

And there seems to be internal reluctancy at making big moves with this cash, even in a period where inter-multinational investments are hot and rampant, even bordering on incestuous. Since the market is generally at ATH, these reciprocal movements make sense as everyone is boosting everyone else's value. But BRK.B is just watching from the sidelines. 

Why?

I suspect even the smartest investors of the firm realize one simple fact: Buffet is about to die, and the news will be on everyone's face, causing a knee jerk reaction along the lines of ""He was irreplacable, the firm will stop making significant gains until true new leadership emerges"".

Which is clearly not true. But humans are spooked easily and many don't know he does not even actively manage the firm anymore.

1nxidln,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 22:34:33,Reddit (RDDT) - Everyone’s Missing What Actually Happened,"
Position: Long 1 contract, Jan 2026 $210 Call (+$362.50)

TL;DR: The 7% drop from “ChatGPT citations declining” is the most misunderstood selloff I’ve seen this year. Google just handed Reddit pricing power on a silver platter.

-----

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED:

Sept 10: Google kills num=100 parameter
→ Search APIs can only pull 10-20 results instead of 100
→ Reddit content (ranked 11-100) disappears from scraped data
→ ChatGPT citations drop from 14% to 2%
→ Stock tanks from $240 to $207

Wall Street sees: “Reddit losing AI relevance”

I see: “Reddit just got monopoly pricing on their content”

-----

THE SETUP EVERYONE’S MISSING:

Before: OpenAI scraped Reddit for free via Google

After: OpenAI must pay Reddit directly for API access

This isn’t Reddit losing value. This is Google eliminating Reddit’s free rider problem.

THE MATH:

Current confirmed deals:

- Google: $60M/year
- OpenAI: ~$60M/year
- Total AI licensing run rate: $200M+

They’re negotiating “dynamic pricing” = pay per use

If usage drives pricing and free access just got killed, what happens to those numbers?

Do the math. It’s not going down.

-----

THE CITATION DROP ACTUALLY PROVES THE THESIS:

Stock moved 14% on an 86% citation drop.

Think about that.

One metric from one AI platform moved a $30B company 14%.

That’s not weakness. That’s dependency.

ChatGPT can’t function without Reddit’s UGC. Neither can Perplexity. Neither can Google’s AI.

They just lost free access.

Now they pay, or their AI gets dumber.

-----

WHY REDDIT WINS THIS:

1. Content moat nobody can replicate

- 100M daily users having real conversations
- Every niche topic covered
- Continuously updated
- 18 years of archived knowledge

1. Q2 fundamentals crushed it

- $501M revenue (+84% YoY)
- Just turned profitable
- 97M DAU (+51% YoY)
- Positive free cash flow

1. AI companies have no alternatives

- Stack Overflow? Smaller, tech-only
- Quora? Dead
- Discord? Private, not indexed
- Twitter? Toxic wasteland
- Where else do you get quality UGC at scale?

1. Google just eliminated their competition

- Can’t scrape Reddit via Google anymore
- Must use Reddit’s direct API
- Reddit sets the price

-----

THE BEAR CASE (because I’m not an idiot):

- Negotiations could fail
- OpenAI might reduce Reddit dependency
- Valuation still rich at 8x sales
- User experience degrading from over-monetization
- Competition could emerge

These are real risks. I’m not ignoring them.

But the risk/reward at $207 after a panic sell on misunderstood news?

That’s the setup I want.

-----

WHAT I’M WATCHING:

Bullish catalysts:

- New OpenAI deal announced (higher rates)
- Q3 earnings showing AI revenue acceleration
- Additional platform partnerships
- Dynamic pricing implementation

Bearish catalysts:

- Failed negotiations
- User growth slowdown
- Continued citation decline without revenue growth
- Management fumbling this opportunity

-----

MY ACTUAL THESIS:

The market saw “citations down” and panic sold.

Smart money should see “free access eliminated, paid access mandatory.”

Google didn’t hurt Reddit. Google just forced every AI company to negotiate directly with Reddit.

And Reddit owns content nobody else has.

That’s pricing power.

The Jan 2026 $210 call gives me:

- 3 months to see Q3 earnings
- Time for new deal announcements
- Exposure to re-rating if market figures this out
- Limited downside (premium paid)

This is 2% of my portfolio. High conviction on thesis, sized appropriately for execution risk.

-----

What am I missing? Where’s the hole in this logic?

Genuinely want to stress test this before adding to the position.

Not financial advice. I own calls. Do your own research.

But if you think I’m wrong, tell me why in the comments.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",708,205,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nxidln/reddit_rddt_everyones_missing_what_actually/,new,Company Discussion,0.89

Insider activity between September 12 and 15 showed seven transactions totaling about $1.52M, with 79% of that value from sales. While that kind of selling can bring short-term pressure, it is often part of normal liquidity behavior for a company scaling at this stage. Against giants like $MSFT and $IBM, $QBTS is differentiating itself by pushing harder on commercialization. With the capital raise complete and adoption trends picking up, 2025 may be the year it proves whether it can hold ground in the broader quantum race.

Commercial traction is becoming clearer too, with bookings in Asia Pacific up 83%. Analysts are pointing to the stronger balance sheet and expanding customer adoption as reasons the outlook looks favorable. I actually made an entry on bitget to test the momentum but decided to exit for now and take more time to study the fundamentals before leaning in further.

Curious to hear how others on this sub are reading the company’s moves. Does the raise, NASA tie-in, and growth in bookings look like the right setup for long-term strength, or do you think the insider selling signals caution?

> The U.S. dollar ended the first half of 2025 with its biggest loss since 1973. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies of the U.S.’s major trading partners, fell about 11% from January through the end of June.

> Elon Musk this week urged his followers to cancel their Netflix  subscriptions over a controversy surrounding an animated show and its creator. Musk on Wednesday posted on his X platform saying, “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids.” The post was in response to an image accusing Netflix of carrying out a “transgender woke agenda.” The controversy seems to stem from conservative backlash over an animated Netflix show, “Dead End: Paranormal Park,” which features a transgender character. The show was canceled in 2023 after two seasons.

> In addition to several anti-trans posts, Musk also responded to a post criticizing alleged statements made by the show’s creator, Hamish Steele, that a prominent conservative X account said “mocked” the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Steele responded to Musk’s callout on rival social media platform Bluesky saying, “It’s probably going to be a very odd day.” Steele also shared a post by TV writer Jack Bernhardt that called “Dead End” a “brilliant show about kind, wonderful characters.” Also this week, vocal conservative activist Robby Starbuck began posting about Netflix, echoing anti-trans sentiments and arguing the company has promoted an ideology that is “hateful to White Americans.” Starbuck, who has repeatedly targeted major corporations in recent months over diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, said in one of his X posts on Netflix, “No one should give this woke company another dime.”

> Analysts say the backlash might not pose as big of a threat to Netflix as Musk may be hoping for. Netflix reported 301.63 million subscribers as of the fourth quarter of 2024, the last time it reported the metric before shifting priority to revenue over user growth. The company has a roughly $490 billion market cap, and its stock is up more than 60% in the past year. Shares lost nearly 5% over the week.

So the alternative is apparently to make a ""contingent stop sell order."" Set the contingent to be ""stock value is greater than X"" then the stop order will be automatically created, and set the stop order to ""sell when stock value falls to X""

I predict that it will hit $1000 then most likely drop shortly after that.

I want to sell my stocks automatically at THAT price, but if I am wrong and it keeps going up, the last thing I want to do is sell right there. I would want to hold on to that stock to see just how high it can climb.

I'm trying to understand the reasons why two tickets of the same company can have differences on their price performance.

During the day, BELFA has gone up about 2%, and BELFB down about 2%.

While I understand than in this case the differences between both tickets are the voting rights and dividend payment, neither of them seem to have changed recently (that I’m aware of),  I don't seem to find a reason why in particular today, those prices are not correlated.

I've searched news about them. I appreciate any hints that help me to understand this.

- “With S&P 500 near record highs, it's time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget it strategy, some experts say

Even amid a federal government shutdown, the S&P 500 climbed to a new all-time high on Thursday.

Yet investors who double down on that index risk overconcentration in big company names.

Here's how experts say to diversify to avoid those risks:

Experts say it may be time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget-it S&P

500-focused strategy, famously touted by legendary investor Warren Buffett.

""The S&P 500 is broken,"" said Michael DeMassa, who is a certified financial planner.

Many investors assume investing in the
S&P 500 index through ETF tickers SPY, VOO or IVV is synonymous with diversification, DeMassa said.

If you can invest in the S&P 500 index for a long time, you will probably do well, said Deva Panambur.

But occasionally the index suffers long periods of underperformance, he said. For example, between 2000 and 2008, the S&P 500 was down by more than 30%.
Wall Street forecasts generally see the index continuing to go up for the foreseeable future.
Still, experts say it's best to choose a broader investment mix in case there is a pullback.

Unlike S&P 500 index funds, total market funds also provide exposure to small- and mid-cap stocks in addition to large-cap companies.
Alternatively, investors may opt to broaden the exposure an S&P 500 index fund already provides in their portfolio. One example may be a fund that tracks a total market index that excludes S&P 500 index stocks.

That’s mostly all of it. I do want to set and forget it, I have about $27.k into the U.S ETF index and Canadian index split evenly. I’m up pretty good. Now sits at 30.8k. With a good amount of money in there now, this article just worried me. What you guys think, is this still the strategy ? Are they just fear mongering?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1. Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Our fundamental needs, at least in richer countries, are met for the most part. However, there is a crisis of purpose for many. Fitness can help fill that void.

2. The proliferation of Social Media. We've become inundated with photos and videos of what ""perfect"" bodies should look like. This has fostered a desire in people to try and achieve that for themselves.

3. GLP-1 drugs. Adoption of these drugs will rise rapidly in the years to come. With it will come a desire to ramp up exercise, in order to justify both the results that people are getting from these drugs and their high cost.

4. Protein centric marketing. Starbucks just added protein infused coffee to their menu. ""Protein"" really is the marketing buzzword of the day.

1nwftai,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 16:56:53,Who actually decides the value of a Stock,"So this is a really beginner question I've never really been able to understand.

You always hear ""supply and demand"". And sure, that kinda makes sense. But I still don't really understand it. Who decides that the right price at this moment right now is X amount of dollars, based on those factors?

For example the real estate market is also driven by supply and demand. Still I can buy or sell a house at any imaginable price, if I find a buyer/seller. And chances are high the house won't go for the exact ""market value"". This is also possible with less unique items like cars, jewelry or electronics (or really anything). There may be an average price for bananas. But still every store won't be the same.

How is the price determined? I'd guess it's some algorithm.
But even then, why can't I sell my stock at half the market price if I feel like it (I can make an order to sell once it reaches that point. But I cannot sell it right now).",0,25,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nwftai/who_actually_decides_the_value_of_a_stock/,new,Advice Request,0.35
1nwecat,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 16:03:20,NVIDIA is climbing again could this be the real long-term bet?,"I’ve been following Tesla and NVIDIA closely, and honestly, the contrast between the two couldn’t be more fascinating.

Tesla just reported a massive milestone: **497,099 vehicles delivered in Q3**. That’s not just growth  it’s a record that shows how strong demand still is. Yet the stock dropped about –4% in the session, which makes me think the market is reacting more to sentiment and macro noise than to the fundamentals. Tesla remains polarizing: some call it the future of EVs, others still see a bubble.

But **NVIDIA** feels different. The stock popped **+3 to 4%** on news it will resume AI chip sales to China after the U.S. eased restrictions. That’s huge. Add to that the steady wave of institutional inflows, and it’s clear that big money is doubling down on AI. The narrative is powerful, the fundamentals are strong, and global demand is only accelerating.

As a trader, I see two clear paths:

* **Play Tesla short term**, with leverage for example through RWA Index Perpetual Futures  which let you trade tokenized stocks. I think platforms like Bitget offer that now.
* Or lean into NVIDIA long term, riding the unstoppable momentum around AI.

Personally, I’m much more aligned with the second scenario. But the real question is for you:

How I lost big by ignoring basic advice.,"I just wanted to share a couple of tough lessons I learned so hopefully, some of the new folks here can avoid making the same mistakes. I got burned twice by ignoring the most basic advice, and I hope this helps someone.

1. Don't put everything into one stock. When I first started in 2022, I put my entire savings into a single stock. It went bankrupt, and I lost everything. Diversifying your portfolio is a cliché for a reason.

2. Don't trade based on emotions. More recently, I sold a position because I knew it was overvalued. When it gained another 15%, I panicked with a serious case of fear of missing out and jumped back in. Two weeks later, the stock dropped by 50%. Trust your analysis, not your feelings.

I hope new investors read this and learn from our collective mistakes instead of making them on their own as I did.

* Total production Q3 2025: **447,450**

The Elon Musk-led company was expected to report around 447,600 deliveries, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. In the same period a year ago, Tesla reported 462,890 deliveries and production of 469,796 vehicles.

William Blair’s Jed Dorsheimer now projects 480,000 vehicles, up from 437,000 and well above Wall Street’s 443,000 consensus. The increase is tied to strong U.S. demand, a rebound in China, and a pull-forward of buyers ahead of expiring EV tax credits.  
  
At the same time, Elon Musk purchased $1 billion worth of Tesla stock and the company announced an expansion of its Robotaxi program. These developments have fueled renewed bullish sentiment around the stock.  
  
That said, not everything points up. Analysts caution that Q4 margins may face pressure as delivery growth slows and revenue from regulatory credits declines. Tesla also trades at a steep valuation, around 118× projected 2026 EBITDA, compared to the 20–25× range of most tech peers. Risks remain in the form of strong Chinese EV competition, Tesla’s reliance on China, and the “key-man risk” linked to Musk.  
  
Across Wall Street, Tesla holds a consensus “Hold” rating, with 15 Buys, 12 Holds, and 8 Sells, and an average target of $346.57 (around 22% downside from current levels).  
  
Position disclosure: I currently hold a TSLA futures position on Bitget. I took the trade after Musk’s share purchase and the Robotaxi expansion news, and it has been profitable so far.  
  
What strikes me is the tension here: on one hand, bullish catalysts like stronger deliveries, Musk’s buy, and the Robotaxi rollout; on the other, valuation risks and Q4 margin concerns.

|2025-09-11|Sale|\-16,120|$47.05|$758,446.00|1,181,186|

Here is how I interpret the situation.

IONQ company:

* Current market cap: 20 billion 
* Has negative net income: -331m in 2024, -176m in Q2 2025
* Miserable gross revenue: 43m in 2024, 20m in Q2 2025
* The dilution is going crazy: Q1 2025 - 25m shares printed. Q2 2025 - 49m (almost $3billion from market cap in one quater) 

What I see in CEO actions:

* Appointed as CEO in 2025
* In Q1-Q2 of 2025 was awarded almost the same amount of $$$ in shares as the whole gross revenue of IONQ in 2024
* The dude goes public and says: “We are the next Nvidia”, “We will make billions in the future”.  
* Stock makes an insane 600%
* The new CEO sells most of his holdings from before 2025, yet in 2025, he gets a massive amount of new shares

What I think:

It is true, he did not sell any of his CEO stock. In fact, in 2025, while being CEO, he got more than a million new shares. I guess that he will get even more in 2025-2026. In this way, his number of shares and stake would remain the same as before 2025, but he managed to print more than 100 million $ in cash on quantum hype. 

This is more than the projected revenue of IONQ for 2025, which is between $82 million and $100 million (and remember, net is still negative) 

Quite a good deal.

1nvw7lt,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 02:23:31,How do you see the whole AI bubble playing out?,"OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. are entrenched in Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, Oracle, Dell, whatever. They are significantly driving up the cloud revenue of these companies, which in turn buy from Nvidia. Investors keep pouring billions into the AI companies, which keep engaging in price wars with each other and spend whatever little they have left on R&D and paying absurdly high salaries in the name of superintelligence.

When, not if,  this bubble bursts and investor funding dries up for the unprofitable companies, what the hell happens? Call me naive but I just don't see a world where chatgpt doesn't exist anymore or one where people use less AI in the future. Even though the LLM companies are not ideal investments, their products are ridiculously good and it is no secret that all the corporations in the world, say in 10 years, will have significantly higher automation than it does today.

My guess is that these big ones (example OpenAI) are almost too big to fail. If there are concerns about liquidity Sundar or Satya or Zuck would probably swoop in to strike a deal with them. Given this assessment and the idea that the world tomorrow would use more AI than it does today, probably a good idea to invest in something like Dell I think, which is currently at a P/OCF of 13 and pouring large amounts into making data centers. In the alternative that some of these big ones fail, I still think there would be someone else to fill the gap and data center companies would stay afloat.

The Cupertino company has moved staff from working on its new, lighter and cheaper Vision Pro to focus on its smart glasses, which would be similar to those offered by Meta Platforms, the report said, citing people close to the issue. Apple engineers are working on at least two types of the smart glasses. One is being crafted to be paired with an iPhone and will lack its own display. This could be revealed as soon as 2026. The other version will contain a display similar to the recently released Meta Ray-Ban Display.

Apple's smart glasses are expected to utilize voice interaction and AI capabilities, the report said. It would also rely on an upgraded Siri, which is projected for a March release at the earliest. They would also feature a much lower price tag than the Vision Pro, which started at $3,499.

Meta released its Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses on Tuesday, Sept. 30. They start at $799 and feature the Meta Neural Band.

1nvo22s,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 19:29:27,IBM : the Nvidia of Quantum computing ?,"Hi everyone,

For a while now, I've been seeing a lot of people betting on quantum computers. I've noticed small companies whose stocks have gone up 10x in just a few months. Some are hoping to find the next gem that will lead this new world, which could be the next technological revolution.

Personally, I don't really understand this sector. I've been hearing about quantum computers for years, but it's true that the Nvidia wave, a simple graphics card company that became the world's largest market capitalization, to the point where a few thousand euros invested seven years ago would make you a millionaire today, has made people eager to bet on the next revolution.

I've done my own research on quantum computing, and when I listen to experts, it feels like it's still very far off, even though there's some ""experimental"" commercialization starting. These computers still make too many errors and don't meet the expected needs.

But in my research, one company keeps coming up when it comes to significant advancements in the sector: IBM. Yet, when I look at IBM's stock price, it's nowhere near the small-cap companies that have seen their stocks multiply by 10.

Today, I'm wondering if IBM, with its experience, technological advancements, and especially its financial resources, isn't the best-positioned company in this space.

However, I never see IBM mentioned in this sector. Worse, IBM is even excluded from sector-specific ETFs.

1nvg1dy,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 14:19:43,"Reminder - Tesla sales trending down, maybe unprofitable 3Q from no emissions credits, and taxi still has safety drivers - stock UP 30% Lol","The absurdity of Tesla knows no bounds. 

* Publicly available China sales data- which is about 35% of Tesla's sales - is still down 9% year over year, and Europe sales are still falling. American sales expect a bump due to loss of tax credits, but with Elon's alignment with Trump in the US generally hurting American sales, and significantly increased EV competition in the US, that bump is likely to be marginable at best. Accordingly, Tesla EV sales are still virtually guaranteed to be down year over year this quarter, stagnant at best. Remember, in 2020 Elon and Tesla bulls were projecting a ramp up to 20 million car sales per year (traditional EV sales, not robotaxi sales) by 2030. They've been stagnant - now decreasing - at under 2 million car sales for over a year now. 



* Worse still, the revenue from automotive regulatory credits will drop to zero starting this quarter, as emissions penalties were eliminated under the Trump administration. Notably, those emissions credits have accounted for, on average, 50% of Tesla's net income over the past 5 quarters; and, 1Q2025 would have actually had a negative net income of -$186 million without the $595 million in income from selling automotive regulatory credits that quarter. 



* And, while robotaxi is interesting and technologically, looks like it's trending towards feasibly working, Tesla still has safety drivers in the markets its operating in -which is mainly Austin at the moment - despite Musk saying it would reach half the U.S. population by the end of the year.  And, recent autonomous driving disclosures to the NHTSA indicate that in the most recent August month Tesla had 3 accidents for having less than 30 cars on the road, a ratio of 0.3/car/month. Waymo, in contrast had 51 incident reports in August for its 1,500 cars on the road across the country, a ratio 0.03/car/month and a factor of 10 less incidents per car per month than Tesla. And, while Musk has touted that Tesla is the leader in robotaxi for something like 8 years now, not only has Waymo factually rendered more autonomous rides with dramatically more mileage and, at this point, had demonstrated to be a working technology; but more and more competitors are popping up, such as Zoox in the U.S.; and pony.ai, BYD, and Baidu in Asia. Which is to say, competition is coming, and some would say has already come and surpassed Tesla, for the robotaxi space as well. 



* Additionally, if one takes a step back and compares the robotaxi market to the current ride-share market - as that's likely what it will displace since most people that own cars will presumably still want to have their own car - even assuming mature, robust market share and profit margins, the valuation is still probably under $300 range. For example, by my back of the envelope math there were approximately 100 billion ride share miles rendered worldwide in 2024. If you assume Tesla had 50% of that market (which is generally an unheard of market share in a market with decent competitions - Apple, for example, has a 25% global market share); and, assuming that, pursuant to Musk's own projections, the cyber cab was able to get cost per mile down to $0.30/mile, and they charged a reasonable $1/mile to riders, and that does not go lower with more competition; that would give 100 billion miles \* 0.5 market share \* $0.70 profit per mile = $35 billion profit off of robotaxis per year. $35 billion/3.4 billion shares = $10.29 per share and giving that a P/E of 30 gives you $308 target price. In other words, in a mature industry where Tesla robotaxi's had global reach and 50% market share, and profit margins of 70% per mile, the high price is still only $300 a share. 

**Tesla is up 30% this month to $450 a share as of today**, and likely trending towards a P/E of over 300 as it's EV sales profits are likely trending towards a range of $1 to $2. **Gotta love the American stock market!**",398,296,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nvg1dy/reminder_tesla_sales_trending_down_maybe/,new,Company Discussion,0.88

The brand is called Amazon Grocery and includes more than 1,000 items, ranging from dairy, fresh produce, meat and seafood to snacks and baking essentials, the company said in a release. Amazon said the new offering unites its Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh brands under one label.

“During a time when consumers are particularly price-conscious, Amazon Grocery delivers more than 1,000 quality grocery items across all categories that don’t compromise on quality or taste – from fresh food items to crave-worthy snacks and pantry essentials – all at low, competitive prices that help customers stretch their grocery budgets further,” Jason Buechel, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide grocery, said in a statement.

It’s not the first time Amazon has experimented with a budget-friendly grocery brand. It launched a similar offering last September, called Amazon Saver, that was “focused on value.”

The move comes as Amazon’s grocery business has been in flux.

The company has continued to streamline its chain of Go cashierless convenience stores and Fresh supermarkets, announcing last week that it will close all of its locations in the U.K.

At the same time, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and other company executives have touted the success of sales of “everyday essentials” within its online grocery business, which refers to items such as canned goods, paper towels, dish soap and snacks.

The company last month expanded same-day delivery of fresh foods to more pockets of the U.S. as it looks to encourage shoppers to add meat and eggs to their order while they’re browsing its sprawling online store.

Here’s why I think CD388 is closer to 75%.

**Disclosure:** I hold shares of $CDTX. This is not investment advice.

In my original valuation post [CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or am I missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)  I modeled CD388 using a **75% probability of success (PoS)**. Some readers pushed back, saying Phase 3 programs are “coin flips” until final results are out.   That’s often true, but I think CD388, Cidara’s long-acting influenza prophylaxis, is further along than that. This post explains why I believe **75% is a realistic and conservative anchor** for estimating what the company should be worth today:

**1)   The dataset is unusually large and robust**  
Many Phase 2 programs enroll a few hundred patients. CD388’s phase 2b NAVIGATE trial had **over 5,000 participants** and took place across multiple geographies during an exceptionally strong flu season.  At the 450 mg dose, efficacy hit **76% vs placebo (95% CI: 49–90%, p<0.0001)**. That kind of result gives far more confidence than you’d get from smaller, underpowered studies that often precede a Phase 3.

**2)   The mechanism isn’t a leap of faith**  
Plenty of Phase 3 failures come from untested biology. CD388 leverages **zanamivir**, the active in Relenza, which already has 20+ years of human safety/efficacy data. The Fc extension used in CD388 changes the half-life, not the core antiviral mechanism, and Fc fragments have been widely used in other approved biologics without introducing new safety liabilities.

**3)   Safety looks clean so far**  
In NAVIGATE, no dose-dependent safety issues appeared across 150, 300, or 450 mg. Adverse events tracked with placebo.

**4)   FDA has signaled confidence**  
The FDA just recently accepted Phase 2b as **pivotal** and allowed a single Phase 3 to serve for BLA filing (see   [$CDTX: FDA Minutes Confirm Expanded + Accelerated Phase 3 for Cidara’s Flu Prophylaxis CD388](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npc6fd/cdtx_fda_minutes_confirm_expanded_accelerated/)). CD388 already has **Fast Track**, and the company has also applied for **Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)**. If granted, BTD would be a further strong validation, speeding review and signaling FDA’s view that CD388 meets a serious unmet need.

**5)   A exceptionally strong flu season stress-tested the drug**  
The 2024–25 flu season was severe, creating abundant endpoints and ensuring the trial was well-powered (better than expected). That adds confidence that efficacy wasn’t a fluke of low case counts.

**While the strong data and FDA support make it tempting to push the probability of success up a notch, I am anchoring it to 75% to stay \*conservative\*.**   The point isn’t that risk has vanished because clearly it hasn’t.  It’s that CD388’s Phase 3 isn’t the typical binary gamble retail investors assume for an asset at this stage of development.  Assuming 75% probability of success in my valuation model reflects the strength of the data and FDA’s stance without overstating the case.

**TL;DR (again):** Many Phase 3s are a coin toss in terms of probability of success. CD388 has strong data, a validated anti-viral mechanism, Fc fragment safety precedent, clean safety over a large phase 2b trial, and FDA confidence,  which is why I am sticking to a 75% probability of success in my valuation model.

> AI is changing fast, and so are its information sources. ChatGPT may be pulling back from Reddit, once a goldmine for conversational training data. If true, this marks a turning point where verified information beats crowdsourced content. A recent observation from Andrea Bosoni caught attention: ChatGPT seems to be ditching Reddit answers. OpenAI apparently figured out that random forum posts aren't always trustworthy. The days of spamming Reddit with fake brand mentions to manipulate AI responses? Pretty much over.

> Reddit was valuable for years because of its massive range of discussions and natural conversational style that helped train AI dialogue. But it came with baggage - misinformation, low-quality threads, and people actively trying to game the system. This move signals something bigger across the AI industry: the push for trusted, verifiable data sources. Better accuracy, less misinformation, and harder to manipulate - that's the goal.

>The tradeoff is real. You'll probably get more consistent, fact-based answers. But that quirky, community-driven personality Reddit brought to responses? That might be fading. For the AI world, it's a clear message: transparency and trust in training data aren't optional anymore. ChatGPT's Reddit pullback shows where AI is headed - credibility over chaos. Fewer wild responses, more reliability. It makes sense as AI moves deeper into professional, academic, and business settings where trust actually matters.",1059,277,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nv7oev/chatgpt_is_moving_away_from_reddit_as_a_source/,new,Unknown,0.96

Companies shed a seasonally adjusted 32,000 jobs during the month, the biggest slide since March 2023, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 45,000.

In addition to the drop in September, the August payrolls number was revised to a loss of 3,000 from an initially reported increase of 54,000.

Due to the government shutdown, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will not be releasing their job report this Friday, unless the shutdown is resolved by then. 

Job losses spread across sectors during September, offset by a 33,000 increase in education and health services as schools reopened and health care continued its long streak of hiring.Elsewhere, leisure and hospitality, a key sector for consumer demand, saw a loss of 19,000 as vacation season wound down. The other services category posted a drop of 16,000, while professional and business services was off 13,000, trade, transportation and utilities declined by 7,000 and construction lost 5,000.

On a broad scale, service providers decreased 28,000 and goods producers shed 3,000.

1nuzqe0,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 01:18:58,PATH to Orchestration,"This morning, ahead of their Fusion conference in Las Vegas, UiPath released some massive press releases. The common theme across all of them - UiPath is partnering with the biggest tech companies to ensure that UiPath's workflow orchestration system, called Maestro, is at the top of its game and able to connect with the best agents and data tools.

They announced partnerships with Snowflake so that Snowflake's Cortex AI agent can integrate into Maestro. This is crucial as many of UiPath's customers have their data stored in Snowflake and will be leveraging their agents for data insights. They also announced huge partnerships with Google Gemini, OpenAI, and NVIDIA. I encourage you to read the press releases for yourself. 

Why is this so important? UiPath is not trying to create every AI agent from scratch - instead, they are building the platform that orchestrates all of the agents and robots at the top...like a Maestro does with a full string orchestra. This will allow UiPath to stay extremely nimble and allow their customers to have access to the best agents in the world - some of which will be built by other companies (CortexAI, NVIDIA) and others that will be in-house (UiPath's PeakAI).

I'm not suprised by these announcements - in my prior post with some detailed DD on PATH, I mentioned that they were already partnered with LangChain and Microsoft Copilot to break down any concerns of developing walled gardens. It's still early days in UiPath's second act; however, the path there is clear. If you are a believer that corporations will be building agentic automation into their workforce at scale, then you are bullish PATH. The company is carving out its spot as the agnostic platform (a.k.a. the Switzerland of automation) that will span across their customers' entire enterprises.",1,0,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuzqe0/path_to_orchestration/,new,Company News,0.56

1nuunc4,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 21:00:45,I am still bullish on CAVA,"I come in here to write up on a nice little stock I like to call CAVA. I just demoralized one of their Mediterranean bowls the other day, and when I was inside, some girl said, ""Why can't they open one up in Parksville?"" I almost said, don't worry shawty, eventually they will.

CAVA has just reached its 52-week low and touched 25 on the RSI yesterday. Its 52-week spread is honestly incredible, 172 high, 58 low, and I feel for those who bought in the triple digits. But I'm not done believing. And I'm CERTAINLY not fading them because of a 50x multiple. Can you guess Chipotle's multiple over the last decade? It is 77x. Over the last seven years, Chipotle grew EPS roughly 40% CAGR (excluding COVID). Chipper was really always trading at a premium.

Now, I'm not sitting here comparing them to Chipotle, just looking at an industry peer. But I want to put into perspective just how small CAVA is, and just how enticing this 2032 1,000-restaurant goal is. They currently only have 400 locations across the U.S. In 2007, one year after Chipper's IPO, they had \~700. Five years later, they doubled their store count, and in those five years, more than doubled their operating margin. In fact, Chipper's operating margin in 2007 was 7.5%, similar to CAVA's 7.38% last quarter. Rapid expansion in the QSR industry pushes margins, and like Ackman said, you can't go wrong owning a growing food chain.

I'm still bullish on CAVA, and yes, I own the shit out of it. I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts.

This company is pre-revenue, publicly traded.*

I'll leave out the stock name to avoid clouding judgement and personal preferences over industry, company, etc. Keen to get your general thoughts on this stock managing question.

Essentially, there is a technology company (with hardware+software products) that's another couple of years away from properly generating revenue. It is a leader in its space, very innovative, very well-connected with traditional industry leaders, has great leadership with great technical background. They play it safe, do not boast. All in all, I feel quite confident in their direction and ability to navigate issues as they hit them. But - They've only hit limited milestones yet (limited compared to final target, but well on-schedule and not technologically limited by any stretch of imagination) and may hit various issues like any startup. Of course, they have good competitors too, though it is not crowded at the moment.

The stock tends to go up and down quite a bit, but I feel there is decent investor confidence.

The big questions are:

\- How much % of your portfolio would you invest in such a stock?  
\- Would you hold it forever? (or at least till it starts generating revenue and profits)  
\- Or would you try to do a bit of swing trading to time the up-downs? This could be even on a part of your holding, but of course there is no guarantee you will time it properly and very like you will get it wrong! But equally, it feels a shame to be holding on to say, 9-10% gain YTD when the stock's gone up and down 30-40%. Of course, like any good startup, as it starts generating revenue and stabilizes as a company, I wouldn't be surprised to see a 3x or more jump in share price...",0,32,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nushl2/how_to_manage_a_good_quality_startup_stock/,new,Unknown,0.22

Edit: if you ever wanted to know when to buy a stock or sell, just look to see if the comments are greedy or fearful.
Sentiment changes fast from my post not too long ago where I was also mocked for saying 230 in an AI bubble is unrealistic 

Recently I made a bold post,I claimed Nvidia would hit 230 by year end….

It’s possible but after today I’m disgusted by the price manipulation.

112,000,000 combined volume before a random thrust up? 

112,000,000/171,000,000 came from two huge bursts of volume. 

This changed my outlook and perception on Nvidia to the downside. If the company is mismanaging and manipulating the stock price to this degree I can’t say I want any part of this.

I looked into the so deal… OpenAI only generates 12B in revenue yet received 100billion? This just seems insane considering OpenAI burned 8billion this year and they’re not profitable but competing against google,tesla,meta that are very profitable especially in free cash flow. At least pets.com didn’t lose insane amounts of money each year.

So Nvidia, why did you invest 100billion in them? Where did these 112,000,000 volumes come from. Now that some random company with 224billion suddenly bought….super interesting 

I’m out of this stock, it’s too risky if it
‘s the case they need outside deals from ‘investors’ to keep a stock moving the way they’d like it to move 

Nvidia is the Enron of today and if you know that history it’s not good. 

One single miss on earnings in this stock that’s priced for perfection is insanely risky 

We usually also get 2 pullbacks in a year, I wonder what the excuse to rug pull will be from wall street

There is already a huge rise in unemployment of college grads compared to past 30 years trend.

I see everyone saying that AI may be a bubble or not a bubble but nobody is talking about what if populist politicians all over the world get in the way and make laws to limit the use of AI when they are reducing headcount.

Having said that, I am scratching my head on how can they even make a law restricting the running of a private company, seems like impossible to do it, isn't it?

Only thing that comes to my mind is: They can make a law to raise taxes on companies if they have increasing profit but reducing headcount. Sounds like a very bad idea since it goes against the very fabric of increasing output via efficiency.

On second thought I think this risk is very low since AI companies will also lobby against it, not to mention it is anti free market capitalism and reeks of a command economy like some communist countries.

The pair, who are also currently copresidents, will transition into their new jobs on Jan. 1 and will report to Ek.

Spotify said in a press release that the move “formalizes” how Spotify has been operating since 2023, with Söderström and Norström largely leading strategic development and operational execution.

1nuhymn,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 12:32:23,Pfizer Gets Three-Year Grace Period From Trump Pharma Tariffs,"Bloomberg) -- Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said the company secured a three-year grace period from President Donald Trump’s promised tariffs on pharmaceuticals in a deal that would lower some of its US drug prices.

The company will sell some products at a 50% average discount on a direct-to-consumer website called TrumpRx, an initiative intended to allow Americans to pay cash for drugs at discounted rates negotiated by the government.

The deal appears to resolve two major threats facing Pfizer, as it would stave off more damaging drug pricing policies while shielding the company from future tariffs imposed by the administration’s Section 232 investigation into whether the cost of medicine represents a national security threat. 

It’s the latest example of the transactional nature of winning tariff exemptions from Trump, who has unilaterally wielded trade policy to exert power over multiple industries. As recently as last week, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on the industry. 

As part of its deal, Pfizer will offer across-the-board reductions on US prices for Americans enrolled in the Medicaid insurance program, giving them “most favored nation” pricing on some of its medicines, Trump said. He has repeatedly pressured companies to bring their US prices in line with what foreign countries pay for medicines.

“The United States is done subsidizing the health care of the rest of the world,” Trump said.

Bourla also announced a $70 billion push on research and development and domestic manufacturing over the next few years. The company was one of the rare exceptions among major drugmakers who rushed to highlight the return of manufacturing facilities to the US amid pressure from Trump.

“We now have the certainty and stability we need on two critical fronts, tariffs and pricing, that have suppressed the industry’s valuations to historic lows,” Bourla said in a statement.",426,144,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuhymn/pfizer_gets_threeyear_grace_period_from_trump/,new,Company News,0.96

One common argument on here is that Google's business model is not threatened by OpenAI, because the highest value searches (shopping related ones) are still done through Google, whereas OpenAI is capturing lower value queries.  So while people turn to LLMs for general questions, they still use Google for online shopping and click on sponsored ads. 

Most importantly, online retailers looking to advertise to people that are directly searching for their type of product really only had Google/Yahoo/Bing as an option, and Google had the majority of market share.

Today OpenAI killed this theory. OpenAI is in the process of integrating shopping directly into ChatGPT. It is still in its early stages, right now only supporting Etsy, and will soon rollout to Shopify. These platforms pay OpenAI for driving sales. 

CPC and CPM for Google ads are notoriously expensive, so if this goes well, expect more online retailers to implement deals with OpenAI, and cut Google ad spend as OpenAI drivers higher return on investment and such announcements boost share price. 

This is a much safer form of performance based advertising. Paying per click on Google ads is risky, because a click doesn't guarantee a sale. If OpenAI is charging a fee based on the final sale rather than per click, this makes marketing ROI much easier to predict.",268,130,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntsp96/openai_launching_instant_checkout_working_with/,new,Company News,0.8

“Think we are headed for or are already in hyper inflationary recession. Gold is priced in already, but oil is massively undervalued. Right now, the U.S. is using its reserves to put pressure on countries like Canada. From my work, I actually have a pulse on how much oil and lumber normally gets sent to the U.S and I can tell you that when the reserves get low oil will serge.

Also let’s say the A.I. Has two big paths either the hype is real and we get Agi or not

In both sides, Commodities will surge, and debt becomes less of an issue. Right now, KOS has a lot of debt, but a weakening currency works in its favor. If A.I. and AGI actually come through, energy will become the new gold like more than actual gold. And yes, eventually renewables like solar will take over, but if you look at what these data centers are and will run on, it’s mostly traditional power.

It’s an actual hedge. Gold’s already priced in the recession panic, but oil? Not even close. Real assets, energy leverage, and upside most people ignore.

The Labor Department is preparing for what would amount to a news and data blackout should the U.S. government suspend operations.

In a contingency plan released Friday, the department said it was looking “to ensure that DOL agencies can perform an orderly suspension of programs and operations should a lapse occur, while continuing those limited activities authorized to continue during a lapse.”


While the department’s scope covers a multitude of areas, the impact on data releases will be pressing for investors. The DOL, in conjunction with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has several key reports upcoming that will provide important clues about the direction of the economy and inform Federal Reserve policymakers ahead of their next meeting in October.

“BLS will suspend all operations,” the 73-page plan stated. “Economic data that are scheduled to be released during the lapse will not be released",1342,194,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm8my/labor_department_wont_be_releasing_data_including/,new,Broad market news,0.98

1ntm28y,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 12:05:17,WeRide (WRD) - Bet on Robotaxis - DD,"If you are looking to invest in a pure-play robotaxi/autonomous driving tech stock with blockbuster revenue growth and major global partnerships, you should seriously consider going all in on WRD. The recent quarter’s results and newsflow have been very positive: 

WRD tripled its Abu Dhabi robotaxi fleet, launched Saudi’s first service, secured permits in Dubai, Singapore, Belgium, and even made Fortune’s Change-the-World list. Some key facts:

# Let's see the recent Analyst sentiments:

* Citigroup (Sep 29, 2025): Initiated WRD coverage with a **Buy** rating and $15.50 price target.
* UBS (Aug 4, 2025): Initiated coverage with a **Buy** and $12.00 target.
* JPM: Initiated coverage orginally at \~$23 earlier this year but move it down to about 13 (still 30% upside from today
* s price)
* Consensus: Average 12-month price target \~$16.32, implying \~88% upside over current levels.

# Recent Earnings & Growth (Q2 2025)

* Revenue: RMB127.2M (US$17.8M) in Q2’25, **+60.8% YoY**.
* Robotaxi revenue: RMB45.9M (US$6.4M), **+837% YoY**, now **36.1% of total revenue**.
* Gross Profit: RMB35.7M (US$5.0M), **+40.6% YoY**, with gross margin **28.1%**.
* R&D/OpEx: Rapidly expanding (Q2 op-exp +42.5% to RMB487.8M) as WeRide scales globally.
* Net loss: RMB406.4M; management views spend as investment in future profitability.
* CEO/CFO: Emphasized robotaxi growth is now *core* to revenues; operations scaling globally is “at an inflection point” toward profitability.

# Robotaxi & AV Partnerships (Tech Exposure)

WeRide’s whole thesis is scaling Level-4 autonomous taxis/shuttles worldwide, with major partnerships and pilots on 4 continents:

* **Middle East (Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Dubai)**: Largest public AV fleets outside the US/China. Tripled Abu Dhabi fleet, first Saudi L4 taxi permit, rides linked with Uber. Middle East fleet aims for 1,000 vehicles by 2030.
* **China (Shanghai)**: Launched L4 robotaxis with Chery Group and Jinjiang taxi firm; co-developed new EV “CER” model.
* **Southeast Asia (Singapore)**: Grab invested in WeRide; first fully driverless robotaxi service planned with thousands of AVs in SEA.
* **Europe (France, Belgium)**: Partnered with Renault for L4 robo-shuttles, pilot programs in Belgium and France.
* **Tech**: HPC 3.0 computing unit cuts AV compute cost \~50%, giving WeRide an edge.
* **Permits**: Holds L4 AV licenses in 7 markets (China, UAE, Singapore, France, Saudi, Belgium, US), more than any peer.

# Key Metrics & Valuation

* Market Cap: \~$2.9B.
* FY2024 Revenue: \~$50.2M; 2Q’25 alone $17.8M.
* Ownership: Founders hold \~4.8% each; corporate backers include SoftBank/Alliance Ventures and Zhengzhou Yutong. Top 25 holders own \~44%.
* Profitability: Unprofitable (2Q’25 net loss \~RMB406M), EPS deeply negative. Cash burn focused on R&D and expansion.
* Guidance: Ambition to scale to “thousands” of robo-vehicles by 2026.
* Analyst Outlook: Average 12-month price target \~$16.3, reflecting strong confidence in growth.

# Recent News & Catalysts

* **Belgium L4 Permit**: First-ever Belgian Level-4 test license for EZ10 Robobus in Leuven.
* **Dubai License**: Robotaxi trial permit; initial 50 GXR robotaxis, scaling to \~1,000 vehicles.
* **Grab Investment**: Strategic equity investment; L4 robotaxis to deploy across Southeast Asia.
* **Index & PR Wins**: Added to Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index; featured on Fortune’s 2025 Change the World list.
* **Saudi Launch**: First public robotaxi pilot in Riyadh with Uber.

**What to watch next:**

* Revenue growth in Robotaxi business.
* New regulatory permits
* Partnerships with the big guys (Uber, NVDA)
* Buybacks

**Bottom line:** While there are valuation concerns due to high multiples, WeRide is unprofitable **but** growing explosively. The Q2 beat, positive analyst coverage, and pipeline of high-profile deployments make a bullish thesis. With a \~$2.9B market cap and small revenue base, the unique global footprint – 30+ cities, dozens of AV permits, and strong industry backing, I see massive growth potential. Catalysts like EU/ME rollouts, index inclusion, and continued robotaxi scaling could drive the stock if execution stays on track.",13,2,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm28y/weride_wrd_bet_on_robotaxis_dd/,new,Unknown,0.76
1ntjtyt,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 10:41:29,Don't be afraid to miss the opportunity. You can't!,"We're in a situation where the stock market is inflated with worthless companies valued in billions - all because people want to buy the next Apple, Nvidia, or Google. Here's my point: you can't miss the next big thing. Successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Their success is a story that lasts for decades. Look:

In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey.

In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with their products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. Think it was late? In 2010, the stock was priced at less than $10.

In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was definitely too late? Ha!

See the pattern? Those stories show that a great business provides a window of buying opportunity measured in years, if not decades. Look at the greatest businesses and see how this pattern holds. FOMO is a lie! You have plenty of time to do your research and enter.

What I'm showing is how great businesses are picked: they change the world with their innovation. No need for empty words and marketing campaigns when you can witness the impact yourself, without a middleman.

A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research, take your time. Even after five years, we'll remain a great opportunity."" A scam business sells you an beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist.

Remember, 99% of start-ups fail even if at some point their stock price rise 10x in short amount of time. That means if you don't do your research and all you read is headlines and biased statements made by insiders, you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Eloquent words != an eloquent business model. Short term gain != long term success.  

Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products (some don't even have products), all because management is big on words, selling ""we are the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action. 

AI, Quantum, Energy, EV... there is always a next big thing screaming from all the corners ""Choose me!"". Before buying, ask this: ""Are you a great businesses? Have you demonstrated your excellence multiple times over the years? Can I witness the impact you make without a middleman's words?"" 

FOMO takes away your ability to analyse and think; it gaslights you with terms such as ""FUD"". A good investment withstands criticism and doubt. Lies needs to be loud because they're lies. Truth is truth no matter what - it doesn't care to shout.",0,17,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntjtyt/dont_be_afraid_to_miss_the_opportunity_you_cant/,new,Unknown,0.27

1ntg57l,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 08:03:28,Auto Parts Manufacturer Bankruptcy:  Impact on the parts retailers?,"First Brands filed for bankruptcy this morning and has major customer concentration in retailers like Autozone, O'Reilly, NAPA and similar.  The company would continue supplying parts, but what happens in the medium to long term with retailers when a major supplier falls down?   I assume that costs can go up as they seek wider sources of supply for their privately branded parts.   Any hiccup in metrics for these high valuation companies could at least be a set-back to their stock prices.

O'Reilly, for example trades at a steep PE multiple (38x last year's earnings) and achieved a $90 billion market cap last week (more than Target and Best Buy combined, and much more than either Ford or GM).   

Over time, these retailers have been borrowing ever larger amounts of money to buy back their shares, boosting their earnings per share figures.   Yet, their operating income (up 18%) is only growing at the rate of CPI inflation (15% since 2021), despite adding many new store outlets.   On average, O'Reilly has grown operating income per store only about 3% over four years which is way below inflation.  

I am betting those PE multiples will come down.   Even going from 38 down to 30 would be near-term hit to stock price.

1nso3q8,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 09:17:00,Wash Sales are Confusing,"Wash sales are a conundrum.
Wash sales are an oxymoron.
Wash sales are a black hole.
Wash sales are damnable. 

Let me explain. I’m considered the pattern day trader by my broker, interactive brokers. I am not one of those day traders that has five screens constantly trading five stocks at a time. I am a day trader that quite often just trade off my cell phone and I usually concentrate on one stock. Most recently it has been NVDA. I can assure you I’m not getting rich, there is no yacht in my future. I have no problem selling the stock for a total of five dollars profit. My goal is not to get rich,  just to give me something to do since I’ve retired. I recently ran across something that I have never seen nor did I know it was occurring. And that is an aspect of wash sales that I did not know was happening. Believe me when I tell you I understand wash sales since Scott trade shut down my trading for three days one time.

I have recently started trading a new stock and in seven days and over 50 trades I only had one loss- that  of a single  dollar. I have made a little  money off this stock. So I was surprised when interactive brokers raised my average price per share on a subsequent purchase  since I have incurred so little losses (a total of -$1 over 50 trades).

For those of you, like me who thought wash sale (or losses) were based on the total trade and not each individual trade you are wrong. It is enlightening. Let’s look at an example. 

The ABC corporation pays a good dividend and the stock price is pretty much range bound at $90 a share. But a rumor has surfaced that the ABC corporation will win a big contract and the share price goes up to $100 a share, you thinking if it’s true it will go higher so you buy one share at $100. Turns out the rumor is false and the share price drops to $80 a share. You knowing it is a $90 share company buy one share at $80. You now hold two shares with an average price of $90 a share. You sell your two shares at $91 per share and pocket two dollars. The price then drops to $70 a share. You realize this is just an over reaction to the loss of a potential contract and you buy one share at $70. But interactive brokers will reflect your average price per that one share at not $70 but at $79.  Because what I didn’t know was when I sold it at $91, I incurred a wash sale from where I purchased it from $100 and sold it at $91. I always thought the wash sale was based on the total sale and not each individual purchase. So when I sell my one share at $90 that I purchased at $70 interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11 ($90-$79). But this is a mirage.  It is an illusion. If you go check your realized gains interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11. YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN WILL ALSO REFLECT A PROFIT OF $11. This is for tax purposes only. If you go look at your cash report, according to interactive brokers, it will reflect a gain of $20. So those of you who are basing their profits off of a realized gain report it is not a true reflection of your actual trading.",0,20,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nso3q8/wash_sales_are_confusing/,new,Industry Discussion,0.45

Trump has championed fossil fuels while attacking the renewable energy industry since taking office in January. His One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress in July, delivered virtually everything the oil lobby wanted.

But Trump's push for lower crude prices, higher tariffs, and the resulting uncertainty caused by his ""stroke of pen"" policies are hurting investment, executives at independent oil and gas producers told the Dallas Fed.

Nearly 80% of executives who participated in the survey said they have delayed investment decisions in response to heightened uncertainty about the future price of oil and the cost of producing crude.

I'm french and watched some economic/financial tv shows. They are talking more and mora about metals and oil.

Yesterday, a financial analyst says 6 millions ton of cooper will miss in the next years. The main reason is typically the industrial sector need more and more, and the reserve are emptier and emptier. So maybe I wonder it's the best time to invest in a good mine company to enjoy the futur strong demand.

About gold, they expected the price will keep on rising strongly because the weakess of dollars and the currency policy of asian country (like the new habits of people) will push the demand. I've just sold Genesis Minerals, that looks a beautiful gold mines, but I needed some cash for another investment. Today, it's tricky to find a good point because too much vol.

Oil : It's tricky. One of them said it's a big time to invest in oil. The reserves look weak, and big oil companies tries to find more and more new reserve. But, the main of analyst said it's not a good move because today, every actor (included investment sector) bet on green energy and are not convinced oil will get a good bet on the next 5 years.

So i would like to get your opinion and if you got some stock to advise, you're welcome :)

Do you think the UNP/NSC merger will be value accretive, or are you worried about the price (as a UNP shareholder) and the additional debt of the combined entity?

Railroads have been by far my worse performing investment. I predicted more industrial integration between US, Canada and Mexico and an increase in trade, but boy was I wrong. In addition, I think the economic landscape is shifting to less higher quality products and software, so the volume of goods transported might increase at a slower pace than it has in the last decade (think cars sales for example). Also Business to consumer has lower margins and higher costs.

Still railroads have their infrastructure in place, are clearly cashflow positive, and pay a small dividend every year and buy back a few shares every quarter, so I don’t think they will lose lots of money long term.

Honestly, I am not a fan of NCS reliance on coal (although this administration doesn’t hate the product), and I am a bit concerned of the additional debt taken over by UNP, as well as the 27% share dilution.

However, the management is unlikely to bankrupt such a profitable company, and I can only see advantages owning such a big chunk of US commercial rail long term, at least for shareholders with a massive time horizon.

Excitement over their rare earth potential is driving high interest in their stock, but mainly class A, $METC. Recent analyst forecasts for METC are $42 and $45. So, there's good potential for return beyond the current price of $31.

But here's the intriguing thing, class B stock is the tracking stock for the rare earth minerals. It will get 20% of the income generated by the rare earths, plus a coal fee per ton and royalty fees. There is currently 
10.84 million shares B extent and 55.18 million shares class A, putting class B at 16.4% of the total. So it certainly seems the better of the two, but class B ($METCB). is currently trading at a 50% discount to class B. 

I own some class B shares and so far, every time I compare dividends with class A, it's been better. Class B should never be worth more than A because the company has the right to convert them back to class A. But class B has the same asset claims as class A. 

This continues to amaze me and I keep coming back to see if there's anything I'm missing, so would really appreciate any insights you might have.

1nr23ui,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 09:59:44,"More Losses, More Liquidity: Who Really Wins Without PDT.","This legislation is just going to be a liquidity injection, more money for the brokers, more money for the Institutions and Market Makers. **Less for Retail.**

It’s a short term illusion of benefit to small players which always benefits institutions; a very common pattern in legislation. It’s never for you.  
Trading influencers will also love it.  
I’m not being cynical, I’m telling you how it is. Lobbyists influence the call.

Undercapitalised new traders will have a more accessible avenue to lose money. All this is, is a smoke screen to further enrich institutions. This post adresses key nuances in the arguement for and against PDT’s removal.

# Here’s my main point:

A lot of new retail traders avoid options because of the perceived complexity; a lot avoid futures because they don’t understand those derivatives either, and a lot have avoided day trading stocks because of the PDT rule. If these same people can’t find a solution to counter it before the legislation, they likely won’t put in the required work to have sustained profitability.

The same type of people who won’t put in the required work will be able to proceed with margin trading stocks when they shouldn’t. The newcomers, tryouts (both old and new) and the social-media influenced.

**The point is this legislation will have a net negative outcome for retail. If you combine (all net trader P&L)/NumberOfTraders it’ll be negative. Influencers and institutions will benefit. Not retail.**

# Addressing Surface-Level Nuances

A trader had said,  
“People, like myself, could do small account challenges with only a few thousand and not be limited to PDT.”

This is very much like gambling with a bankroll in a less complex market.  
Margin trading stocks instead of options (which didn’t have a PDT rule).

This trader had also said,  
“There are tons of people in my circle who trade with both a full time job, family, and school. That has absolutely nothing to do with it. They trade just as successfully as others.”

For those thinking similarly, don’t let survivorship bias cloud your judgement. Profitability is different from sustained profitability. For now they are. **Check Figure 1.**

# Nuance 1: The Main Narrative 

“What you're not seeing, which is obvious is that by removing PDT rule, traders under 25,000 are no longer pressured to get a win on each trade.”

I get your point and understand it fully, but this is a deterrent to not margin trade stocks if a trader is undercapitalised. This stops people from margin trading stocks (trading with leverage). They can do whatever they want on a cash account with or without PDT; it’s a smoke screen so the decision can be justified to sceptics.

# Nuance 2: PDT doesn’t save people from giving their money to the market.

Here’s an example: Cigarettes are harmful but we should allow people to smoke, sure. But should we make it more accessible? Does it benefit the smoker or the tabacco industry more? Tabacco.

It’s like that with removal of PDT people will still trade, it just accelerates the losses and inflates undercapitalised retail participation.

**Margin trading is a choice, and PDT only restricts margin accounts.**

The point is this legislation will have a net negative outcome for retail. If you combine (all net trader P&L)/NumberOfTraders, it’ll be negative. Influencers and institutions will benefit. Not retail.

# Nuance 3: Should people who don’t have 25k to avoid PDT not trade?

That’s not what I said. If anything, I suggested that people who don’t have the time to trade consistently or aren’t rigorous enough with their trading are more likely to lose money.

I do this for a living and know what it takes. It’s not about capital; it’s about knowledge, effort and experience.

A lot of new retail traders avoid options because of the perceived complexity; a lot avoid futures because they don’t understand those derivatives either, and a lot have avoided day trading stocks because of the PDT rule. If these same people can’t find a solution to counter it before the legislation, they likely won’t put in the required work to have sustained profitability.

The same type of people who won’t put in the required work will be able to proceed with margin trading stocks when they shouldn’t. The newcomers, tryouts (both old and new), and the social-media-influenced.

# Nuance 4: most traders lose money so it's better to lose 2000 than lose 25000

If a Retail trader’s balance drops below 25000, the PDT rule kicks in.

**Nuance 4.1: Removal of PDT will be great and remove barriers to entry on the same playing field. PDT Removal will be the best thing to happen in retail stocks**

The points and statistics I’ve cited still apply; it’s financially better for market makers, institutions and brokers but not for retail traders

It’s an overwhelming net negative for the retail investor's pocket. whilst enriching institutions.

**Nuance 4.2: many new traders will have opportunities to grow in ways that wasn’t possible under the old rule**

Few out of many; for most (over 85%), it will be another opportunity to lose money quickly in a more accessible way.

It’s an illusion of freedom because margin trading stocks is an optional thing, and it’s a credit facility that’s offered to the retail trader to increase their risk.

The PDT rule was a limitation on how they could access the credit facility if undercapitalised; it was not about restricting freedoms.

In the 1920s, people were margin trading stocks whether they were average guy or institutional.

People got liquidated, and suddenly you have the Great Depression as a consequence. You need to understand these measures have effects that can cascade into something brutal for everyone.

**Nuance 4.3: It's 2025, not the 1920s, anymore.**

I get your point, but markets have operated in the same way for hundreds of years: supply and demand. Margin has also existed for hundreds of years. It’s nothing new.

# Nuance 5: AI screeners and other tools became more common. It's easier to identify winning stocks now!

This isn’t true and it’s a short term anecdotes don’t hold weight and trend that will be corrected by market algorithms. You need to realise that over the strategies over the medium term can have the illusion of being profitable.

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/w12ck7smlirf1.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fcbcf9a25a68820909b33f246bd1b9ad4e43176)

# Nuance 6: Far more people agree that this change is better than not changing it

This doesn’t mean it’s in your best interest. It’s marketed that way. There should be no appeal to emotion; this should be a redundant factor.

Everything in markets is mathematics and statistics. I’ve read several research papers and over a dozen books. Look at fund managers, practitioners (prop guys), quants, and portfolio managers; they all take it into account, and every profitable trader I’ve communicated with who can present trading statements to prove it takes them into account.

# Nuance 7: You're looking at the negative; it's true you could accelerate losses just as it is as true as you could accelerate winning.

Most traders lose money; that’s a fact, regardless of the exchange. I’m not looking at just the negative; I acknowledge there’ll be winners too. Just very few. Most that win will lose everything they make and/or more due to human psychology, the sunk cost fallacy and other factors.

**Nuance 7.1 It's 2025; we have access to information unlike any other time period in the history of stock trading.**  
That just makes the market more efficient/random this makes market movements harder to predict and profit

**Nuance 7.2 You can look at statistics, but these statistics are based on the 25,000 PDT Rule.**

Most retail traders, over 85%, lose money (according to ESMA, the most generous value), and over long timescales, \~98% lose money. Removal of PDT will increase the number of people margin trading (trading with leverage), which will increase the number of losses and liquidations.

# Ending / Agenda

For transparency: I don’t trade US equities, and I am a UK-based trader; think of me as playing the devil’s advocate.

**If you don’t trade stocks, why bother debating this?**  
I have experience in trading US equities, but I don’t currently trade them; I trade futures and CFDs.

I posted this because I want traders to understand that these legislative changes are rarely in their best interest.  
**Lobbyists make the call.**

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

My understanding is that Hedged indexes protects from currency fluctuations in my case EUR-USD, but with some extra TER cost, in this example 0.03%

Am i wrong in thinking that the extra 0.03% (i know it is compounded over time) is worth the spent to protect from the currency fluctuations? I am not experienced enough to understand Forex and this is why I prefer to play it a little safer. Am I wrong in thinking that?

Also, the NQSE is 10x smaller (hedged - i know it is newer as well), is that because people prefer to get a riskier ETF (SXRV unhedged) that will generate more profit if the EUR will get weaker than USD?

Is the unhedged like investing in both the stocks themselves and forex while hedged is just the stocks?

With construction underway coast-to-coast, Lumen is moving forward a multi-billion-dollar build with plans to add 34 million new intercity fiber miles by the end of 2028, for a total of 47 million intercity fiber miles. The company has already delivered millions of new fiber miles, network capacity upgrades and high-speed connectivity enhancements in 2025, building the network infrastructure enterprises need to power their AI workloads.

“AI is fueling a surge in network demand like we’ve never seen, and Lumen is building the backbone to meet it,” said Kye Prigg, executive vice president, enterprise operations, Lumen Technologies. ""This isn’t incremental – we plan to more than double the size of our U.S. network. We’re positioning Lumen as the trusted network for AI, ensuring our customers have the network scale, speed, and reliability to confidently innovate and grow without constraints.”

**2025 milestones on the road to 47 million intercity fiber miles****^(1)****:**

* **Deployed New Fiber:** Added more than **2.2 million new intercity fiber miles**(2,500+ route miles) and projected to reach 16.6 million total intercity fiber miles by year end. Lumen is utilizing next-generation fiber optic cable from Corning Incorporated to fit two times more fiber into existing conduit.
* **Constructed Signal Boosters:** Construction efforts underway at **176 In-Line Amplifier (ILA) sites**. ILA shelters built on these sites serve as giant signal boosters along the Lumen network with up to triple the power density compared to traditional ILA shelters and are designed to be updated, renewed, and scaled for the future.
* **Expanded Conduit Access:** Completed **IRU conduit deployments across 55 additional routes** expanding Lumen’s ability to add and control fiber on these routes by securing long-term rights to underground pathways.
* **Increased Network Capacity:** Added **5.9+ Pbps of total capacity** to the Lumen network so far this year, preparing to deliver the bandwidth needed to handle large volumes of data processing.
* **Extended Faster Speeds**: Earmarked more than **$100 million to bring high-speed connectivity** up to 400Gbps across clouds, data centers, and metros, creating a more seamless, high-performance pipeline for AI workloads. **The Lumen 400G-enabled network now spans more than 100,000 route miles**.

Lumen Private Connectivity Fabric (PCF) is designed for AI workloads. By using fiber with 25% less optical loss than competitors^(2) and 60% more capacity than traditional designs, PCF helps move data more efficiently and at greater scale. The Lumen network achieves latency less than five milliseconds at the edge, covering up to 97% of U.S. business demand. And with diverse routes connecting more than 50 major cities, Lumen operates the largest ultra-low-loss intercity fiber network in North America.

“Every mile of new fiber and capacity upgrade adds to the strength of our Private Connectivity Fabric. Lumen is doing more than expanding infrastructure, we’re laying the foundation for the AI economy,” added Prigg.",20,15,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nqv9l4/lumen_accelerates_multibilliondollar_network/,new,Company News,0.79

1nqm5g2,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 19:35:41,Tesla’s continuing sales slump in Europe weighs on stock price,"Tesla shares fell more than 4% on Thursday after data out of Europe showed a continuing sales slump for the automaker, despite strong demand for fully electric vehicles in the region. 

Tesla EV registrations in Europe, a proxy for sales, fell by about 23% year-over-year in August, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) on Thursday.

There were 14,831 Tesla EV registrations in Europe last month, down from 19,136 in August 2024. In the first eight months of this year, Tesla EV registrations in Europe declined 32.6%, the ACEA said.

Meanwhile, total EV registrations throughout the region rose by around 26% through August compared to the same period in 2024. By contrast, registrations for petrol and diesel-powered vehicles declined by more than 20% over that stretch.

Still, RBC analysts wrote in a note on Thursday that they expect Tesla’s total deliveries for the third quarter could amount to 456,000, above a FactSet-compiled consensus of 448,000 deliveries and a Visible Alpha consensus of 440,000 deliveries.

The analysts expect a bump for Tesla as consumers rush to buy EVs in the U.S. before a $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of September.

Even with Thursday’s slide, Tesla’s stock has bounced back following a brutal start to the year. It’s now up 5% in 2025 after plunging 36% in the first quarter.

Musk’s political activism in the U.S. and beyond has hurt the Tesla brand and dampened its appeal to many prospective EV buyers.

Earlier this year, Musk endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party, and this month he appeared by video at an anti-immigrant rally in the U.K. that turned violent. The rally was led by activist Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rebuked Musk for “dangerous” comments that he made at the rally, where 26 police officers were injured. Musk told attendees, “violence is coming to you” and “you either fight back or you die.”

To revitalize interest in the brand, Tesla has said an affordable new model is in the works, which could help it fend off increased competition from the likes of Volkswagen, BYD and other EV makers that have been picking up market share.

In 2021 they hit almost **$400** per share and with the lower interest rate environment their fundamentals are drastically improving again!

**Why it’s squeezable**

* **Short interest:** **\~21.1M shares** short = **\~26.3%** of float; **days to cover \~3.2**.
* **Float:** \~**84.1M** shares.
* **Borrow dynamics:** IBKR **CTB \~0.4–0.6%** lately; available shares fluctuating (\~150k–350k seen). If price trends up, borrow can dry up fast.

**Fundamentals massively improving**

* **Q2’25 revenue:** **$257M, +\~102% YoY.**
* **GAAP net income:** **+$5.6M** (vs. loss a year ago).
* **Volume:** loans +\*\*\~159% YoY\*\*, dollar volume **\~$2.8B**.
* Balance sheet and guidance commentary point to continued normalisation of funding.

**Macro tailwind**

* **U.S. Q2 GDP revised to 3.8% annualized**, a solid backdrop for risk assets and consumer credit cyclicals like UPST

**Price targets**

* Street 12 month PTs cluster around **$81 avg** (range **$47–$108**), implying notable upside from here. However, this could go MUCH higher with the interest rate cuts now planned and their improving financials - plus with the squeeze potential.

**Catalysts**

* Next earnings + any funding/partner expansions
* Options OI building into earnings can add fuel too

**Levels I’m watching**

* Break/hold above recent supply zone = go time, invalidation is a decisive close back below the last higher low so watch for this...

**Thesis:** Shorts are crowded into a name that just flipped back to profitable with triple digit revenue growth, right as macro prints strong. If UPST clears resistance with momentum then its going to blow up...

I wasn’t expecting to see these two “old guards” of semiconductors shaking the market at the same time.

For Intel, the rally came from a mix of catalysts lining up. Micron’s strong earnings gave confidence back to the sector, and Intel raised its outlook for 2025. With around 76% market share in x86, they’re better positioned than many thought. Digging deeper, I saw they’re preparing the Panther Lake (18A) launch for late 2025, getting US government and SoftBank support for their AI/foundry ambitions, and placing large orders with ASML for the next-gen High-NA EUV machines. They even announced an AI partnership with Trust Stamp, focusing on biometrics and privacy. No surprise analysts bumped the price target up to $43 with a buy rating.

Marvell, on the other hand, is playing a different card: a massive $5 billion buyback, including a $1B accelerated program with $300M already executed this quarter. Instead of betting on a future product or tech breakthrough, they’re giving back directly to shareholders to boost confidence in the near term.

What struck me is the contrast. Intel is trying to rewrite its future by going all-in on AI and foundry, while Marvell is choosing immediate stability. Two very different visions in the same sector, but both managed to move the market big time at the same moment.

What do you think? Can Intel really reinvent itself for the long run, or is this just a short-term rebound?",146,119,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nq6s8e/intel_jumps_8_while_marvell_spends_5b_on_buybacks/,new,Company Discussion,0.95

Copper prices jumped Wednesday after Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) declared force majeure on contracted supplies from its Grasberg Block Cave mine in Indonesia.

Three-month futures traded above $10,496 per ton ($4.7710 per lb.) on the CME, up 2.74% for the day. In London, copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 2% to $10,172 a ton on the London Metal Exchange, the highest level in more than 15 months.

Freeport’s shares fell as much as 10.4% in New York, while rivals Glencore PLC (+3%), Teck Resources (+5%), and Antofagasta (+7.4%) climbed.

Analysts described it as a “negative near-term development that will likely put Freeport in the penalty box.” However, BMO also highlighted that 60% of Freeport’s copper production comes from North and South America, meaning the company still has strong regional output. At the same time, a potential increase in copper prices stemming from reduced supply could partly offset the impact.",38,2,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nq3oqn/copper_price_spikes_on_freeports_grasberg_force/,new,Unknown,0.94

1nprxr3,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 19:52:44,"Nvidia Stock, poised to surpass 230 by year end","Nvidia stock is very misunderstood. Many have been shorting at 180’s and buying at 170’s. It’s been doing this since July 28th. Consolidating for nearly two months.

Nvidia’s key points 

1. They’re not lying about demand. I haven’t heard anyone comment about China not being relevant to their success…the reason Nvidia isn’t concerned is simply because demand surpasses supply even without China.

2. Nvidia has been talking with intel behind the scenes for about a year confirmed by Jensen. If we read in between the lines it means they’ve likely already sucessfully merged a product with intel. Nvidia should never be underestimated with the resources they have at their disposal. Another market Nvidia will dominate and quickly take shares of.

3. Nvidia is an early investor in many of the upcoming giants of tomorrow like NBIS and CoreWeave. All those gains are net positives for Nvidia and only contribute to continued growth. NBIS for example has the most significant growth rates I’ve ever seen a company produce. 820percent revenue before Microsoft deal? That’s execution.

4. OpenAI isn’t a public company,Nvidia is now getting a slice of the most desired AI  company that’s still operating privately. People don’t understand that now Nvidia will have access to all the data OpenAI has…

I could just go on for paragraphs about all the deals Nvidia is doing, about the acceleration of new products but one thing we forgot to mention is Nvidia Hasn’t Moved in Stock price despite having a forward PE of 31…..while the s@p average is currently 27. Why is that you ask? Because currently the market couldn’t give a sht about value.The needle won’t explode with a stock valued at 4.35trillion like oracle or Crypto. 

Nvidia is an exceptional company that’s constantly preformed,evolved and is without a doubt the centre of AI and even still insane growth potential. 

Stocks spend months in consolidation period Nvidia has definitely been doing that, simply a no brainer buy. 

It’s an Undervalued stock considering it’s crop dusting any other of the mag 7. 

I am an Nvidia Investor and I’ve added more today at 176.20 as I believe we’ll see a big rotation in Nvidia and several other chip stocks, I’ve averaged up from 91 to a current of 120 because I see this as a great opportunity for solid gains.

The moment 185 breaks is the moment I could see this hitting 210.

Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

• **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

• **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

• **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
• AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
• Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
• More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
• New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
• Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
• Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
• Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
• Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
• Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
• Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
• Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
• High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
• Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
• Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
• Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
• Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
• Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
• Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
• Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
• Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",259,114,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/,new,Company Discussion,0.83

> Regulators are moving to dismantle one of the most controversial barriers for active retail traders the $25,000 minimum equity rule for pattern day trading. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority on Tuesday approved amendments that would replace the long-standing threshold, making active day trading more accessible to smaller accounts. The change is pending approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

> The $25,000 minimum equity rule mandates that traders must maintain a minimum account balance of $25,000 in a margin account to execute four or more day trades within a five-business-day period. The rule was put in place in 2001 amid the dot-com bubble and crash as regulators grew worried that small traders were taking excessive risks with volatile internet stocks.

> FINRA is replacing this mandate with an intraday margin rule that applies the existing maintenance margin rules to intraday exposure. In other words, one’s intraday buying power will be based on the margin requirements for the positions they take on during the day, not a fixed equity minimum.

I have been with my advisor for a very long time. More than 20 years. Up until the last few years I was extremely busy, and mentally fully occupied, with a demanding career. I left things to the advisor, although I met with him annually. His approach has been very conservative for an extremely conservative throughout that time, way before retirement was on the horizon, and returns have been muted even though the market has shown a long-term uptrend. In a nutshell, it is his practice not to own any individual stocks in a portfolio, in deference to various bond/money market and mutual fund investments. Think 60/40 scenario. A substantial amount of the portfolio has been devoted to foreign stocks, also held in mutual funds, that for many years were essentially flat or declined to some extent compared to US equities. In the last year or so, those have done much better as we all know. These investments have shifted and been adjusted over the years, but very slowly, and with little responsivity to large changes in market conditions. My question is essentially is this a common approach for financial advisors? Of course, it’s clear that such an approach makes managing client’s accounts much less labor intensive, and if one’s clientele is especially sensitive to volatility, it minimizes that factor and probably calms nerves. So it’s easier for an advisor to approach things this way.

This is an extremely tricky situation. The Fed thinks they can rate-cut their way to lowering unemployment. This is not going to work. Lowering rates simply frees up capital - it doesn't guarantee job creation. There is currently no shortage of capital as evident by the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI infrastructure. Lowering rates will simply free up more cash for these types of long-term AI investments that will end up reducing more human labor than it creates.

Also, as the Fed lowers rates, inflation (compounded by tariffs driving up costs) will go much higher. This puts the Fed in a very uncomfortable economic trend called stagflation. It's the elephant in the room that no one wants to publicly say. We're heading toward stagflation. Risk assets will sell off in the short-term. In the longer-term, there will be winners and losers.

1npf99s,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 11:30:25,"Fermi America IPO, is this Legit?","It seems like this company is well positioned to do what they say they would. They plan to supply the energy for data centers with a nuclear plant in Amarillo, Texas. It was founded by Rick Perry and Toby Neugebauer who both have deep ties to both the Texas government and Texas energy sector; which likely smooth permitting processes/timelines. Work and construction set to begin next year, and first plant operational by 2032.

But there’s three big red flags for me. For one this company is relatively new. The second piece is going back to the fact that this plant would be in Amarillo, Texas. Where are they going to get the water from to cool a nuclear plant, and how the heck would it be affordable if it needs to be piped in from somewhere else? Last piece is cash burn, I’ve read they’ve secured 350M in private funding already; and are hoping to secure another 550M from going public. But I see that nuclear plants can cost anywhere from 6B-9B, so for something that would be completed in 7 years it seems like they would need more cash than they hope to get via IPO to meet that goal. Do they already have contracts lined up that’ll front the construction costs? Or maybe government funding they’re expecting that hasn’t been announced? 

All to say, some numbers aren’t adding up to me here and the company is pretty fresh. If it weren’t for the founders having deep ties to the Texas energy sector I could more definitively say this is an AI hype cash grab than a legitimate push.  

The primary growth prospects before the plant opens is the company hitting construction milestones, potentially receiving government funding, and signing contracts to supply data centers. At that point it seems like you’d sell the news.

Any other thoughts on this? I’d personally need to see answers around where the water comes from and how they expect to get the rest of the cash needed for construction given the aggressive timeline btwn now and the first plant opening.

1npc6fd,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 09:29:35,$CDTX: FDA Minutes Confirm Expanded + Accelerated Phase 3 for Cidara’s Flu Prophylaxis CD388,"In my first post ([CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or am I missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)) I hinted (very strongly!) that FDA minutes for Cidara's ""End of Phase 2"" meeting could be a major turning point for Cidara. That news is now official, and it’s even stronger than expected:

**1. Phase 3 accelerated**

* Start pulled forward by 6 months:  enrollment begins Fall ’25 in the Nothern Hemisphere, not Spring ’26 as previously planned.

**2. Single Phase 3 may be sufficient for approval**

* FDA supporting that CD388 could go straight to a **BLA filing off one registrational study** if phase 3 is successful. That cuts **2–3 years** off the approval timeline.

**3. Expanded patient population**

* Originally: high-risk comorbidities + immunocompromised.
* Now: also includes **all adults ≥65**, significantly expanding U.S. eligibility to **100M+ patients**.

**Why this matters**

* FDA support for BLA filing after this phase 3 trial is a huge signal of confidence.
* The accelerated start reduces time-to-revenue.
* Expansion to ≥65 significantly expands the potential TAM.
* Together, these updates shrink the “binary biotech discount” the market is still applying to CD388.

**What’s next?**

The next milestone is a potential BARDA award, with a decision expected by year-end (unclear if that means government fiscal year-end in September or calendar year-end in December).

Cidara has been clear: they are seeking BARDA’s help to onshore and scale manufacturing capacity. That may not mean an immediate stockpiling contract, but it’s still a strategic step. For CD388 to play a role in pandemic preparedness, the U.S. government will want domestic supply secured.

So the way I see it:

* Best case: BARDA supports manufacturing build-out and future stockpiling.
* Baseline case: BARDA helps de-risk manufacturing scale-up, validating CD388 as a preparedness asset.

Either outcome reinforces CD388’s long-term strategic value.

**Bottom line**

Universal flu prophylaxis used to be fiction. With today’s FDA minutes, CD388 is:

* Accelerated
* Expanded
* Supported by the FDA
* And fully funded through Phase 3

The market is still treating CD388 like a long shot. Today’s FDA news makes it clear: this is less and less about ""if"",  and increasingly about ""when.”

In my next post, I’ll do a deeper dive into why CD388’s probability of success is higher than most Phase 3 assets and update my rNPV valuation to reflect this news.

Micron shares have nearly doubled so far in 2025. The company makes memory and storage, which are important components for computers. Micron has been one of the winners of the artificial intelligence boom. That's because high-end AI chips such as those made by Nvidia require increasing amounts of high-tech memory called high-bandwidth memory, which Micron makes.

1npbyeg,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 09:20:09,$PATH Toward a Multi-bagger,"I have been building my position in PATH for about a year now and am starting to see a recent surge in interest. After noticing a bunch of ""why PATH?"" posts across various subreddits, I decided to provide my thesis:

* UiPath's flagship legacy product is currently the MARKET LEADER in enterprise Robotic Process Automation (RPA) - automating repetitive, generally clerical tasks for enterprises by leveraging PATH's ""software robots"" which can scrape processes and repeat tasks very efficiently (think of robust ""if this, then that"" rules).
* In October 2024, they announced that they were re-building their software suite to be focused on agentic AI with the goal of becoming the primary agnostic software player that would automate entire workflows at the top layer of the enterprise and allow customers to build across third party applications (i.e., not caging enterprises into the walled gardens of Salesforce, Microsoft, etc.). This is a game-changer, as it would go way beyond the rule-based constraints of RPA - it would leverage generative AI to let the software make decisions across platforms.
* In Spring of 2025, UiPath released their Maestro enterprise orchestration software and began putting together proof-of-concepts for their customers. The feedback has been great as Maestro allows customers to build custom end-to-end workflows that combine UiPath's industry-leading RPA technology with the newly released suite of generative AI capabilities. UiPath has a huge advantage over competition as they are already a trusted provider of software automation for over TEN THOUSAND enterprise customers.
* Their go-to-market strategy is super compelling as they have massive partnerships with Deloitte and SAP to help market their products. They also have strong relationship with other software providers like LangChain and Microsoft to ensure UiPath is staying relevant and connected with top companies in the supply chain.
* From a financial perspective, their balance sheet is INSANELY STRONG. Zero debt and $1.5B of cash/marketable securities on-hand.
* They recently made a strategic acquisition of Peak AI to further their product offering by adding a specialized inventory and pricing management AI agent to their software stack.
* Their CEO and founder Daniel Dines is a GENIUS who owns 10% of the company (massive skin in the game). He had the vision, technical prowess, and leadership skills to essentially invent the enterprise RPA market and dominate it before anyone else - he is now going after the enterprise agentic AI space.
* Share price is currently insanely cheap at 4-5x trailing twelve-month sales. Their revenue has been growing at decent clip of \~10% per year, but that doesn't even include the inevitable growth of their agentic AI products that are just now starting to be marketed and gain traction. The market has been sleeping on UiPath and the growth of their new agentic AI automation software is not priced in at all - the industry is projected to grow at a 40% CAGR between now and the end of the decade. Even in a stock market pullback, I think downside risk is pretty limited given the cheap multiple they're already trading at.
* A weakening labor market (which is where we're headed) is bullish for a company that is selling software that allows companies to automate processes and ""do more with less"". So owning PATH is also a natural hedge against the unemployment rate going up.

For all these reasons, PATH has become the second largest position in my portfolio.

Literally any investing related sub will tell you that. The most common advice is “time in the market beats timing the market,” and that if you buy quality companies or broad index funds and just hold for decades, you’ll come out ahead.

But then I see so many people actively trading stocks. Sometimes daily, sometimes weekly, trying to time short term moves. From the outside, it feels like that goes against the idea of long-term compounding, especially when you factor in taxes and trading costs.

So what exactly is the appeal of trading over long-term investing? Do traders believe they can consistently beat the market? Is it more about short-term cash flow rather than long-term wealth building? The excitement that comes with it?

> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday noted that asset prices, a category that typically includes stocks and other risk instruments, are at elevated levels. During a speech in Providence, Rhode Island, the central bank leader was asked how much emphasis he and his colleagues place on market prices and whether they have a higher tolerance for higher values.

> “We do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we’re trying to achieve,” Powell said. “But you’re right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued.” In the run-up to last week’s policy meetings, stocks and other assets rallied strongly as conviction grew that that the Federal Open Market Committee would be lowering its benchmark overnight borrowing rate. Stocks have continued to climb, setting a succession of record highs for major averages, since the decision Wednesday to cut by a quarter percentage point.

> “Markets listen to us and follow and they make an estimation of where they think rates are going. And so they’ll price things in,” Powell said in part of the conversation dealing with mortgage rates.

That combination makes AMSC one of the cleaner mid-cap growth plays I’ve seen recently but there’s very little discussion around this company compared to other energy-adjacent players.

American Superconductor (AMSC) is a ~40 year old systems company for megawatt-scale grid resilience, data centers, wind controls and naval ship protection (high-power electronics, STATCOMs/D-VAR, high-temp superconducting wire which is basically super efficient power transmission, ship protection systems).

AMSC owns useful HTS and power-electronics IP and has won program-level naval and utility work (like a ~$75M Canadian Navy deal). That combination (IP + visible contracts + cash/backlog) is what makes the company interesting to me.

If AMSC consistently convert bookings at decent margins and avoid further dilution, you get margin expansion + multiple re-rating (defense contracts + grid demand are sticky, and their tech is already shipping). If they don’t, downside is fast. Same facts cut both ways. The company has a very relevant set of products as energy grids and fleets demand more power density and stability to integrate wind, solar, rapidly-increasing data center loads and advanced naval systems.

I’m curious to hear from anyone who knows much about AMSC, currently invests in them, or understands their market niche well. Trying to gauge if there’s as much upside left here as it seems.

But outside of Interactive Brokers, I cannot get the market price or information on these ORSTED-T units, for example Google Finance or Financial Times market data. This is problematic for me since I manage all my holdings in a Google Sheet.

Additionally, the IBKR message has popped up a second time about a voluntary CA Election. It says that of my remaining ORSTED-T holdings, I can further subscribe them to another election.

Now the media on that day had about a million explanations for the outsized jump including Ai, backlogs and the projected outlook.

I just cant help but think the TikTok deal was built into that outlook. Oracle said they signed 3 multi billion dollar contracts but didn’t say which ones. They projected rev this year to be 18B, and by 2029 144B annually. This kind of projected growth by a tech dinosaur, in my opinion should not be met with the kind of surge we just saw. Especially when the company has been missing earnings projections on and off for years. That is a wait and see if I ever saw one.

It just feels like blatant insider trading. Everyone knew Oracle was getting the deal. Everyone knew earnings call was going to be the moment to jump.

*Oklo Inc today holds a groundbreaking ceremony at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for its first Aurora powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”*

*“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.*

*The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.*

*“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”*",88,45,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1no03ff/oklo_breaks_ground_on_first_aurora_powerhouse/,new,Company News,0.92

What is a good strategy to capitalize on a still very young industry with new players joining every day? I'm currently seeing three main segments that drive revenue with a TAM that's rapidly expanding across all three segments:

**Infrastructure**
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft and Oracle are building chips and datacenters to generate compute. All of the MAG7 companies are investing heavily in their own facilities to become a big player in the scene without any sign of slowing down.

**Data**
The place the internet comes together is a goldmine for LLM's to be trained on. Places Like X (Twitter) (owned by xAI) GitHub (owned by Microsoft, very valuable for coding), Stack overflow, Wikipedia, Quora, but maybe the biggest and most valuable of them all, yes, Reddit. A very important aspect of why Reddit's conversations are very valuable is because there is no money incentive like on X. The company has gone public in 2024 and has done licensing deals with Google and OpenAI and others worth 200M+ annually. They are reportedly currently in talks with Google for a much bigger deal. The platform is imo mildly monetized and thus growing rapidly. A company worth looking into financially.

**Applications**
Probably the biggest and widest segment that has yet to fully materialize is the way AI has been putting itself on the market as a product. The most obvious applications are LLM's like ChatGPT, but OpenAI is not close to profitability. Self-Driving cars are also slowly being applied, but in low numbers. Public companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and Palantir are among a bigger group of companies well positioned to thrive in this segment.

AI is no longer just a buzzword. The companies that control infrastructure, data, or applications are setting the rules of the game. The next few years are going to separate the leaders from the followers. If you’re looking to understand where value is being created, AI is still a an early opportunity.",2,19,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nny89w/long_term_ai_strategy/,new,Industry Discussion,0.54

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

First, let’s state the obvious: we’re not in a low-rate environment right now. However there are some things happening that are leading to one. Regardless of your views of the current U.S. president, he’s been pushing Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. So far, Powell has remained focused on the economic data and stayed independent in his decision-making. However, Powell’s term ends in about eight months (May 15, 2026). Once that happens, it seems almost inevitable that Trump will try to appoint someone more in line with his agenda, someone who will likely push for rate cuts until his target rate of around 1.5% is reached (this seems to be the consensus, though I’ve seen various estimates).

If/when that happens, I expect markets to take off for the foreseeable future. Why? Because lower rates mean cheaper borrowing. A simple(although flawed as mortgage loans are amortized amongst other things) example:

A $500K home at 2% interest would cost roughly $665K over 30 years (assuming no early payments).

A $500K home at 6% interest would cost $1.1 million over the same period.

This is basic economics, lower interest rates increase borrowing power, which lets companies expand faster and take on more risk.

Does this mean we’re heading for another major recession or depression eventually? Probably. But that timing is much harder to predict than the markets’ current expectation that a low-rate environment is coming.",52,30,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nntg89/in_a_low_rates_environment_nearly_all_equities/,new,Broad market news,0.78

For years, Microsoft has been seen as OpenAI's exclusive partner, providing the Azure cloud infrastructure and integrating OpenAI's models deeply into its ecosystem. They had a deal for a huge chunk of OpenAI's profits and seemed to be in the driver's seat.

Now, Nvidia isn't just a supplier anymore; they're a massive strategic investor.

Does this mean Microsoft's influence is significantly reduced? Is their ""special relationship"" with OpenAI over? Are they now just one of two major partners, or does the Nvidia deal sideline them in the long run? It seems like OpenAI is diversifying its dependencies in a big way.

1. Eli Lilly (LLY) – With its advanced immuno-oncology pipeline and existing blockbusters, it feels almost unavoidable. What stands out is their ability to diversify revenue while staying a leader in such a competitive field.


2. Pfizer (PFE) – Known for vaccines, but their oncology division is getting stronger with targeted acquisitions. Despite the post-COVID slump, I think they remain a solid long-term player in cancer treatment.


3. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) – Probably one of the most robust oncology portfolios. Their CAR-T therapies look very promising, and while the stock price isn’t exploding right now, I believe it’s one to keep on the radar.



The only issue on my side: I’m still pretty new to stocks.  I noticed that some crypto platforms like Bitget are starting to list tokenized US stocks and RWAs, I’m not sure if that is very similar to traditional broker.

Is there anyone here trading oncology stocks? Which ones are you watching, and what broker do you recommend for someone still trying to get past the KYC headaches?

>The partnership highlights how linked OpenAI and Nvidia are as two of the biggest drivers of the recent artificial intelligence boom.

This is quite the circular economy we got going here. By investing in the deeply unprofitable startup that buys their product, they ensure demand for their products remains strong.

Probably the right move for Nvidia, because a lot of this money will come back to them, and they can sell their hardware at high Margins. And with their stock trading at 50x earnings, it makes sense to spend their cash flow on funding/acquiring AI startups rather than buying back shares.

This all but ensures the  AI bubble keeps going a couple more years, but also inflates it even further.

Historically, gold and the markets have been divergent. When people are optimistic, they pile into the markets. When they get worried, they move into gold. It's pretty rare to see them both hitting ATHs at the same time. I am curious to hear your thoughts on this.

From my perspective, it seems all of society is bifurcated right now on just about everything. We have a large group of Chicken Little's, that think this is all going to blow up in our faces any day now. Even Warren/Berkshire is holding a record amount of cash and more T-Bills that the Treasury itself ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/why-warren-buffett-s-berkshire-hathaway-now-owns-more-treasury-bills-than-the-federal-reserve-11807572)). Conversely, we seem to have an equal size group of Pollyanna's that think we are entering into some sort of golden age and manage to find a silver lining in every bit of news (pun intended). I am somewhat agnostic and think both groups are not seeing things too clearly. At the end of the day, it is the optimistic crowd that drives the markets and set the prices. If they keep thinking they are getting a good deal and remain willing buy what the others are selling, and they believe in it enough to hold, then the markets will just keep going up or possibly plateau for a while until some external event drives them in either direction.

There is lots of money going into specific buckets right now, such as AI and crypto, which is also hitting ATHs. I have no idea what people think they will do with the stupid amount of money flowing into crypto and its offshoot financial products (other than trying to make a quick buck). And I think all the AI plays will take much longer to shake out and find the winners and losers than most people think (like the dot-com era). I view AI stocks with mind numbing P/Es, precious metals, and crypto as all something investors would need a high level of conviction and a buy-and-hold mindset to buy into right now at these levels. And I question how much conviction is really there.

With both groups (Chicken Little's and Pollyanna's) buying into both sides of fear and optimism, it seems like every scenario is priced in. It's like a double bubble face-off that just keeps growing, just waiting for something to happen. Even if more geopolitical turmoil erupts and/or inflation starts ticking back up with high unemployment, are people really going to buy in more to precious metals when they are at ATHs already? Without hitting the bottom line in spectacular fashion, is there any development that can get AI more hyped and inflated while we wait for it to generate a real ROI somewhere? And what if nothing happens at all and things more-or-less stay the same economically and geopolitically?",993,343,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnpqxs/markets_and_gold_are_both_hitting_aths_last_time/,new,Unknown,0.93

Now, the company wants a second win.

Starting on Monday, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema will hear arguments in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on how to fix Google’s monopoly over some online advertising technology. The judge ruled this year that Google had broken the law to protect its dominance over the largely invisible system of technology that places ads on pages across the web. The hearing is expected to last for two to three weeks.

The Justice Department has said it wants Google to sell the technology it uses to connect buyers and sellers of ad space, among other potential remedies. Google has instead proposed measures including changing its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers.

Judge Brinkema’s ultimate decision could disrupt the company’s $3.1 trillion business and help rewrite the playbook for tech dominance in the modern internet era.

After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

- Nuclear energy stocks are roaring upwards, sending nuclear energy speculative stocks soaring despite being loss-making, and despite no revenues in some cases (OKLO!), so it’s only a matter of time before attention turns to a high-growth, cash-generative business like Rolls Royce, which keeps announcing new deals.

- Rolls-Royce won a £2,500,000,000 deal in June to build nuclear reactors in the United Kingdom. Last week, they’ve issued a statement on it welcoming in the “Golden Age” of nuclear energy.

Sure I’ve missed so many things there as all the many divisions of Rolls-Royce seems to be on turbo charge at the moment.

With aviation demand rising (and especially from Airbus more than Boeing),  with defence spending rising, and with the growing and desperate need for more sustainable energy solutions from nuclear, etc etc, it is inevitable that Rolls-Royce will be announcing more deals on all fronts in the coming weeks and months.

I understand it’s pretty obvious markets would react negatively but how detrimental really would a large scale war in Europe be financially? 

Russia’s control of oil supply could send gas prices soaring but what about the economic impact from Eastern Europe at war? Russia doesn’t seem to be ready for a full scale war against NATO and seems to be testing the waters but they are preparing to do so. I think if we see congressmen start selling off their stocks like we saw before COVID that would be a great sell signal to GTFO before the market crashes. 

Historically how have markets reacted to large scale wars? We haven’t really had a large scale war since WW2 so we don’t have recent examples to go off of except maybe around 9/11 and the beginning of war in the Middle East but that doesn’t affect global markets like a war in Europe would. I also assume investing in defense contractors would turn out to be very profitable.

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley’s are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley’s. When economic conditions are rough, there’s not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn’t be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been sharply declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is “motorcycles are dangerous”. Anyone who rides motorcycles, knows someone who has been injured or killed on a bike. It is not very uncommon in the community.

6. The overall state of the market makes me nervous. Everything’s great until it isn’t and I want to have a hedge against a potential downturn in the market. I think this company would be more heavily affected than anything else I could choose from.

Those are the main points. I’m sure there are some more that you guys could think of but I thought I would share what I thought about Harley Davidson.",148,91,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nn8wd5/the_reason_im_shorting_harleydavidson_hog/,new,Company Discussion,0.83

1nm567c,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 14:07:12,The Future of RDDT Stock,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.

Even after all the interest you would pay on the margin funds, I would practically be a millionaire.

1nlxych,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 09:17:39,ETFs that benefit from the likely multiple interest rate cuts and a probable strong Q4.,"**SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)**:  It has a clean 10% run from late May that holds into September, which breaks the historical trend that is known for low volume and choppy price action.  This deviation could be a setup for an October treat that leads to a strong fourth quarter.

**iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF** **(TLT)**:  This long-term Treasury bond has gained price appreciation over the past month from the expected and subsequent federal interest rate cut this past Wednesday.  It is moving higher along with stocks from the interest rate cut, with two more likely rate cuts before the end of this year.  It peaked at $172.25 on Aug 6th, 2020, and has never gone below $80 for the past 23 years.  The Treasury Bond ETFs do not have the price action of stocks and other ETFs, but it is also less risky with a limited bottom and a significantly higher monthly dividend yield. Yields from Treasury Bond ETFs are subject to federal tax, but are exempt from state and local taxes. 

**SPDR Gold Shares (GLD):**  Gold has hit an ATH without much hype and is likely to benefit from the upcoming multiple interest rate cuts.

**Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS):**  This ETF has up 20% since June and shows that money continues to flow into dominant cloud, AI, and digital infrastructure.  The price appreciation of Magnificent 7 is pointing to a supercycle that will likely lead to one of the strongest fourth quarters.

1nltilf,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 05:16:54,Indian Market Data Shows ESG Scores Flip Normal Price Discovery Rules,"Market mechanics just got weird. A recent analysis of Indian stocks shows that companies split into two trading patterns purely based on their ESG ratings:

* High ESG companies → spot market leads futures (completely backwards from normal).
* Low ESG companies → futures market leads spot (as expected).

Futures are supposed to lead because they’re cheaper and more efficient. Yet somehow, ESG flips the script.

What’s wilder: the effect isn’t uniform.

* Banking & IT → bidirectional causality, no matter the ESG score.
* Cement, oil & gas, pharma → high ESG firms drove spot-led discovery.
* FMCG & autos → low ESG firms showed futures-led dynamics.

My take: post-COVID inflows into good companies might have made spot trading hypersensitive, leaving futures lagging. For traders, it suggests that ESG leaders vs. laggards, the traditional playbook won't work.

1nlsjr7,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 04:15:18,Investment Strategy,"Hello everyone. 

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I’m doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I’ve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I’ve never had much of a strategy, I’ve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I’ve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in “core” growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in “moonshots” like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. 

The issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max. 

I struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I’m up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there. 

At the same time, it’s becoming almost impossible to manage 33 stocks at once effectively. 

How can I remain cold & calculated? Should I just sell all my smaller positions now, take the money & focus on my new strategy?",1,11,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nlsjr7/investment_strategy/,new,Advice Request,0.55
1nlrvhd,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 03:31:36,Bears only hope remaining to maul the bulls,"I am not a bear or a bull I am bullish but alot more cautious than most and wont fomo into some of the stocks I have been watching as I know its a dangerous time when people think the market is easy.
Anyway bears have been slaughtered recently and perma bulls are making money and most people are in the delusional stage of the rally and see no way down. 
Whilst this is unlikely I can seen one major way in which the market could turn ugly, its a black swan event so unlikely but its always good to account for black swans as they have a disproportionate negative impact.
I think energy prices mainly oil and gas are low right now and thus support the fed when it comes to their expansionary monetary policy, cutting rates to boost the job market and stocks love that. However, if we were to get a supply side shock because of one of a number of reasons such as an escalating war then this would mean inflation would become rampant like in the 70s and the fed would have to raise rates or create a class war or major social unrest. At the minimum they could not cut anymore, this seems unlikely and is not a prediction but any reason for a significant spike in inflation which has already been high since Covid would be the bears last hope.
It would tank the market imo or cause some if the worse violence and social problems since 1929 and the rise if the far right.
Something like this is not likely now but in Europe or the Us I can see something like this being fairly probable in the next 3 or 4 years in an already vulnerable underlining economy.

Just to clarify not a prediction, more something to start debate on potential causes of high inflation and a stock crash or alternatively if you think there is another factor at play more likely to stop fed easing and cause a major slow down.

I know they have that $24.5B ATM shelf open, which means they can issue more shares basically any time. Based on some modeling I did, here’s what another raise might look like:
	•	If they raise $2B at $60/share, that’s roughly 33M new shares → about 15% dilution.
	•	If price tanks to $30 and they raise $2B, that’s 66M shares → closer to 30% dilution (way worse).
	•	If price rips to $100 and they raise $2B, it’s only 7.5% dilution (pretty mild).

Historically, they tend to announce raises when share price + ETH price are strong so I’d expect the next dilution within the next 3–6 months if conditions stay favorable.

My big fear is: if they hit us with a big raise and the market sells off, this could easily drop to $55 or even $49 support levels fast.

Bogleheads are all too familiar with the theory 30-40% international diversification in their portfolios. But what about the rest of investors? Not including ~~degenerate~~ traders, most investors want to protect the gains from the Covid era. Looking at allocations into meaningful domestic and international index portions could be very protective, especially if you are closer to retirement.

Counterpoint: US AI growth could lead to fresh valuations and global market innovation. But I suspect that few winners will carry the lot, still resulting in broad market underperformance compared to internationals.

1nlf722,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 16:54:37,"SPT Sprout Social - Big upside move ahead, AI and Social Media","Hi everyone,

with this post I want to introduce the company Sprout Social (Nasdaq: SPT) and explain why, in my view, buying the stock could pay off over the mid to long term.

**1) About Sprout Social:**  
Sprout Social, Inc. is a U.S.-based provider of cloud software for social media management. From one central platform you can schedule and publish posts, handle comments and messages, run performance analytics, and monitor social conversations. Sprout Social serves roughly 30,000 customers in 100+ countries and is among the leaders in this space. The business model is Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with recurring subscription revenue.

Sprout Social was founded in 2010 and went public in 2019. Headquarters are in Chicago, with offices in Seattle, Dublin, and Kraków, among others. The company currently employs over 1,300 people worldwide and has received multiple awards for its products and customer satisfaction (including #1 Best Software Product 2024 according to G2).

Market cap: 0.84 billion (Prior year: 1.6 billion, -47.5%)  
Revenue: 0.45 billion FY 2025 (Prior year: 0.4 billion, +12.5%)

**2) Risks (just Sprout specific, of course there are more overall)**  
\- Sprout Social still reports GAAP losses of 57 million in 2024. However, it operates profitably on a non-GAAP basis. If Sprout fails to manage costs effectively, particularly in areas like sales, marketing, and research and development, or if it cannot accelerate revenue growth, the path to full profitability may be delayed.

\- The declining market cap is a consequence of the lack of GAAP profitability and the slowdown in revenue growth over the past few months.

\- SBC: The company reports non-GAAP profits despite reporting GAAP losses due to a high amount. At least the SBC rate has remained stable: Q2/2025 reported SBC expenses of $20.2 million, which is almost unchanged from the prior year ($20.6 million). Additionally, SBC’s total expenses for the first half of 2025 were just under $40 million, compared to $38.7 million in the prior year.

**3) Opportunities**  
\- In the era of AI, data scale plays a crucial role. Sprout Social, for instance, connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this data scale.

\- Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance.

\- Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.

**4) Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:**  
\- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

\- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

\- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.

1nl7vt4,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 12:14:02,Jerome Powell on the labor market and why they chose to cut rates,"All direct quotes from the fed meeting:


“In the labor market, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August but remains little changed over the past year at a relatively low level. Payroll job gains have slowed significantly to a pace of just 29 thousand per month over the past three months. A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force, due to lower immigration and lower labor force participation. Even so, labor demand has softened and the recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the “breakeven” rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. In addition, wage growth has continued to moderate while still outpacing inflation. Overall, the marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers is unusual. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. In our SEP, the median projection for the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and edges down thereafter.
Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the Consumer Price Index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent. These readings are higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up. In contrast, disinflation appears to be continuing for services. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about tariffs, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.0 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent in 2026 and to 2.1 percent in 2027.
Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4-1/4 percent and to continue reducing the size of our balance sheet.“

1nl2uoj,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 08:57:26,$CDTX: H5 bird flu results are in,"Yesterday I flagged that the results from a study to evaluate in vivo efficacy of Cidara's CD388 pre-exposure prophylaxis against H5N1 (bird flu) would be presented today at the ISRV conference in Singapore. The results are now out ( [A single prophylactic dose of CD388  provides protection against highly  pathogenic bovine-origin Influenza  A virus in the ferret model](https://www.cidara.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ISRV-2025-Cidara-CD388_H5N1_Andreevl-FINAL.pdf)).  The study results were presented by Konstantin Andreev, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

**Key findings:**

This is the first in-vivo demonstration of CD388 against H5, building on prior in-vitro data.

In the ferret model (the gold standard for flu):

\***A single prophylactic dose protected against lethal H5 challenge.**

\* ≥10 mg/kg = 100% protection, with dose-response observed (3 mg/kg = 75%, 1 mg/kg = 25%).

\*Treated animals showed reduced weight loss, fewer symptoms, and no systemic spread or neuroinvasion.

\*CD388 also reduced viral shedding and cleared virus from the upper respiratory tract by Day 9.

**Why it matters:**

\*Confirms CD388’s potential as a **true pan-influenza prophylaxis**, not just seasonal.

\*Strengthens the **pandemic preparedness** story.  This is the type of data BARDA and other governments look for when deciding on stockpiling/contract awards.

\*Reinforces the idea that CD388 carries **strategic “insurance value”** on top of its seasonal high-risk market.

 

**Next milestones to watch:**

1.      End-of-Phase 2b FDA minutes (expected shortly): Looking for confirmation of an accelerated Fall ’25 Phase 3 start vs. planned spring 2026 base case.  May also confirm if Ph2b counts as pivotal, allowing for shorter phase 3. News on  Breakthrough Therapy Designation could also be included.

2.      BARDA decision on grant application.  CEO has said a decision is expected by year-end (unclear if fiscal or calendar). This is the next potential big non-dilutive funding catalyst.

**Bottom line:** Seasonal flu alone supports my conservative $445 (!) share rNPV. With H5 protection confirmed in vivo, CD388 is positioned not just as a seasonal prophylaxis but as a potential pandemic countermeasure, which  strengthens the case for BARDA funding and stockpiling.

Earlier this week, President Donald Trump proposed the idea that companies should no longer provide earnings reports on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead. The SEC said the agency is actively looking into that plan.

“At President Trump’s request, Chairman \[Paul\] Atkins and the SEC is prioritizing this proposal to further eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies,” an agency spokesperson said earlier.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed by just a majority vote on the SEC, where Republicans currently hold a 3-1 voting majority, with one open seat.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",113,56,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,new,Industry Discussion,0.89

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1nksav5,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 23:00:45,UPS Has A Limited Downside From This Price,"United Parcel Service (UPS) $85

**Industry/Sector/Type –  – – Transportation/Goods/Cyclical** 

Biggest catalyst for the stock – High dividend yield and low valuation, scraping the bottom of the barrel for “value” stocks. Cautious buy, expecting a limited downside.

**Positives**

**Low Valuation:** United Parcel Service trades at a decade-low valuation of 12x earnings, which doesn’t give enough credit to its pivot from low-margin Amazon volumes towards higher-value customers. I believe that in a few years, UPS should improve operating margins significantly from the current 9% to about 12% with better paying customers.

**Healthcare logistics market:** The healthcare logistics market is estimated to grow at 9-10% to $82Bn, and UPS has plans to double revenues from this segment to $20Bn by 2026. This is a significantly higher valued market with a lot of specialized functions - storage, handling, and time-sensitive transportation, essential when you're delivering medicine, biologics, and medical devices. The $87Bn UPS has a competitive advantage over smaller carries, because it has a lot of infrastructure in place - such as temperature-controlled storage in several locations to cater this industry from clinical trials to patient deliveries. The best part of course, premium pricing. 

**Cost cutting and operational improvements:**  Here are the key points of UPS $3.5B cost reduction program:

* Reducing 20,000 jobs in 2025, across operations and management, with voluntary buyouts.
* Closing 73 facilities as part of a broader consolidation.
* Automating 64% of operations.
* 35% of reductions will come from operational roles, and 30% from Capex.
* Consolidating package routes.
* Raising revenue per piece by dropping less-profitable customers and increasing rates on retained volume

**Negatives**

**Under performer** – In the past decade the stock has lost 14%, with a very high percentage of Amazon’s business, which hurt margins. It has fallen significantly off a high of $203 from 2022. 

**Lack of forward guidance** – turnaround efforts have flattered to only deceive, two recent examples, it pulled its 2025 revenue and profit outlook in April and again withheld from providing targets in July. 

**Tariff uncertainty**  – the US-China trade being a key contributor to the lack of clarity. The demise of the de minimis exclusion of merchandise below $800 from tariffs is hurting UPS.

**Valuation**

After 15% and 4% earnings and revenues drops in 2025, I do expect UPS to return to 10-11% earnings growth and 2-4% revenue growth for the next 3 years.

A market cap of just $71Bn against $87Bn in sales is attractive. Add to that a historically low P/E of 12, and a dividend yield of 7.5%,

**High yield** – its dividend yield of 7.5% looks safe for now. **This a cautious buy.** The only caveat is that we still have a lot of trade uncertainty, and if the turnaround takes longer, this could fall even further, but I believe the downside is limited from here.

This makes me doubt the long term prospects for Intel here. It seems like Nvidia is investing this money to help their China export prospects and gain favor with the current admin, and it won't help Intel's foundry struggles.. so that means TSMC will likely continue being the winner regardless

Why it matters:

* **H5 is high-mortality flu** with pandemic potential.
* **CD388 has already shown in-vitro activity against H5**. Tomorrow’s readout is **in-vivo.**   If results are good, that’s additional proof of **broad, pan-influenza prophylaxis** beyond just seasonal strains.
* Governments care about (and pay for!) **pandemic preparedness**. Positive H5 data could bolster the case for BARDA stockpiling, the next potential big non-dilutive funding catalyst for Cidara.

My baseline rNPV ([CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)) only accounts for seasonal high-risk cohorts in High Income Countries (HICs).

Strong H5 data increases the probability of **optional upside** :  
• Pandemic preparedness contracts (BARDA, ex-U.S. stockpiles).  
• A strong pandemic countermeasure story supports the strategic “insurance value” of CD388 and could lead to a reduction in the “skepticism discount” that seems to be currently applied to the asset.

The results won’t change my conservative base case on valuation right away, but it adds meaningful **optionality that isn’t included in my model yet**.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story. 

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.

basically they use AI , analytics and consulting to help ecommerce brands optimize marketing channels and relevant data. 

to be aligned with their partners , they actually purchase inventory from their brand partners and help them sell through on the global marketplace direct to consumer

some key financials pulled from their s-1

revenue climbed 29% from 1.366b to 1.796b from 2023 to 2024

gross margin from 44% to 43.5% from 2023 to 2024

the company is in a rare position these days to have stable profits and operating cash flows before IPO 

19.8m net profit in 2023 to 42.5m in 2024

the IPO at its current range would price the company at 2.7x sales. this seems quite undervalued to me for topline growing close to 30% and with stable cash flows and profits

I've held some stocks (BAC, AMZN, GOOG, SOFI, and a few others), that I have had for years (so I won't be taxed at short gain tax at least).

By now they've gotten at/over, or very close to, 100% returns. Now some of them give dividends even if it's very little (BAC and GOOG), so it's more incentive to hold them even longer term. 

I ASSUME these companies (well most of them) will be around long enough for me to hold another 30ish years before I retire, which is currently where I'm leaning towards.....BUT that's my opinion, and I feel it'd be foolish not to take other views that I might not have thought of into account. How do you all decide to take profit (minus life changing choices events like buying a house, medical or other type of emergency, etc etc)? Or are you all just planning to hold these types of stocks till retirement as well?

1njy059,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 23:42:38,Zillow Will Benefit Strongly From A Housing Rebound,"**Zillow (Z) $90.75,  Planning to add tomorrow morning**

**Industry/Sector/Type - - - Housing Marketplace/Platform/Steady growth tied to housing cyclicality.**

**Biggest catalyst for the stock** \- If interest/mortgage rates keep reducing and housing bottoms out, this could be a better way to play the housing rebound. It’s asset light, a market leader with a lot of scale and has emerged much stronger in the housing sector decline.

The great fight against inflation, which saw the Fed funds rate shoot up from 0.25% to over 5% in a short 16 months from March 22 to July 2023 felled the overbought, overpriced housing industry, which is still struggling to recover two years after its peak. Existing home and new home sales peaked around Q1-2022 at 6.1Mn and 1Mn units respectively. Now, they’re down 33% to 37% from that peak to just 4Mn and 625K units. **However, prices have dropped only 5% to 7% from their respective peaks and at a 6.5% mortgage rate continues to be a severe impediment to any kind of a rebound.**  
But if the housing market rebounds as housing cycles normally do with lower interest rates, I think Zillow would be a great way to take advantage of it.

**What’s positive about Zillow?**  
**Market leadership** \- dominant online buying and rental platform, with over 60% market share.  Zillow's housing app makes it the most visited real estate site in the US, with an estimated 243M Monthly unique users over its various platforms, with its engagement levels several notches above its competitors.

**Rental revenue** \- Rentals are now 25% of revenues, growing at 36%. With housing increasing unaffordable for younger cohorts, Zillow's has focused on rental demand by building a multiple listing service (MLS) on steroids. Its largest supply comes from multi-family landlords, growing at 45%. Its scale, reach and heft give it operating leverage even with lower revenue growth,  growing revenue per user and better conversion rates than smaller competitors. Zillow also gets high margin ancillary revenue from after-market services, such as title, mortgage financing, and escrow services.

**Beating the industry** \- Its For-Sale business is still growing even as new and existing home sales continue to decline.  
**Earnings growth** of over 30% expected with 14% revenue growth in the next three years.  
**Strong earnings momentum** \- beat in the first two quarters of 2025.  
**Lower mortgage rates could goose housing** \- with labor markets weakening, I believe that the 25 basis point cut is the start of declining interest rates, which would give the moribund housing industry a decent boost. I now believe that Zillow is a better long-term option than homebuilders to play housing at much lower risk.

**Zillow had wasted a significant amount of money, time and resources with its first-party home-flipping business, which they exited. Thank God! That was a disaster.**

**Negatives, challenges and risks**

**Housing cycle needs to recover** \- Poor existing, and new home sales, combined with still high prices and mortgage rates suggest that the housing cycle still has a long way to recovery.

**Stock could remain range bound** \- The stock has been on a tear gaining 44% over the last 12 months, much of the first two quarter’s earnings growth could be priced in.

**Stagnant housing market** \- A stagnant housing market has resulted in poor listing volume and even fewer transactions.

**Cyclical industry** \- It cannot escape housing cycles.

**Prices still high** \- Home prices need to drop further, they’re just 5 to 7% below the 2022 peak.

**The dispute with Compass could derail growth** \- The large real estate brokerage platform, Compass’ use of private “pocket listings,” reduces the availability of listings on Zillow’s site, attacking Zillow’s business strategy of aggregating the largest number of listings. Should this practice continue with other brokerages, the business will fragment, diminishing Zillow’s appeal as having the the largest inventory of listings.

To be sure with the 44% rally, the stock is already priced at 39x 2026 earnings, growing at 30%, with a forward PEG of 1.3, Similarly it quotes 7x 2026 sales growing at 14%. Not terrible, but no longer cheap either.

However, if housing recovers, we're still getting in close to the market trough. More importantly, Zillow has used the housing downturn to emerge stronger and gain market share at the expense of weaker rivals.

1njv8wk,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 21:26:21,Mark Zuckerberg unveils $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses,"Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display.

The glasses, which costs $799, contain a small digital display that can be controlled via hand gestures through a wristband powered by neural technology, confirming a CNBC report in August. A promotional video of the new smart glasses appeared on Meta’s YouTube page on Monday but was later removed.

The new smart glasses are a bridge between the company’s audio-only Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and the experimental Orion augmented reality glasses that the company revealed at last year’s Connect event. Orion can overlay 3D visuals over a person’s real-world field of view with the help of a wireless computing puck, but the glasses are expensive to make and not yet available to consumers.

The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses come with the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that allows users to control the device using hand gestures.

“These are glasses with the classic style that you’d expect from Ray-Ban, but they’re the first AI glasses with a high resolution display and a fully weighted Meta neural band,” Zuckerberg said.

With the new glasses, people can do tasks like watch videos through the display or see and respond to text messages, Zuckerberg said. The display doesn’t block a person’s view, and it disappears when not being used, he said.

The glasses go on sale in the U.S. on Sept. 30.

The company on Wednesday also debuted the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses, intended for athletes who participate in high-intensity sports like snowboarding and mountain biking. The Oakley-branded glasses will cost $499 when they launch on Oct. 21, making it $100 more expensive than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses that went on sale in June.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses have a sportier look than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses thanks to a wraparound design that extends its colorful lenses around a person’s temples. Unlike the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, the new model contains a button on the underside of its frames so that athletes who wear helmets can more easily capture photos and videos.

The new sports-centric smart glasses have up to nine hours of battery life, can capture 3K video and contain speakers that are louder than their predecessors. The glasses can connect with Garmin-branded fitness watches to track certain stats like their heart rates using the Meta AI assistant. Preorders start today.

Meta also debuted the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the latest version of the company’s original smart glasses. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) costs $379, up from $299 for the version released in 2023. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) has double the battery life of the previous model, lasting 8 hours on a single charge, and a more powerful camera that can capture 3K Ultra HD video. The new glasses go on sale today.

Zuckerberg also announced Horizon TV, pitching it as a way to watch television shows, sporting events and movies using the company’s Quest VR headsets. Some of Meta’s partners who will be contributing content to the app include Disney and Universal Pictures, Zuckerberg said.

>Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.

>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen.

>In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4‑1/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Austan D. Goolsbee; Philip N. Jefferson; Alberto G. Musalem; Jeffrey R. Schmid; and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action was Stephen I. Miran, who preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting.

1. Uber just invested 300 million dollars to partner with Lucid on a 20,000 unit robotaxi fleet built on the Gravity SUV platform. This is a huge validation of both Gravity and Lucid’s tech, with the first launch planned in the US next year
2. Saudi PIF backing is still solid which means financial support is not going away
3. The Gravity SUV launch on the consumer side adds another growth angle beyond the Air sedan
4. EV names often move together. Any rally in Tesla, Rivian or the sector can give Lucid a sympathy lift
5. Cost cutting has started to show up in the financials and management is working on margins
6. The reverse split has already played out and most weak holders are gone which reduces negative sentiment
7. Lucid is no longer trading like a penny stock which means bigger institutions can step in
8. Central bank policy leaning more dovish supports high growth names like Lucid by lowering funding pressure

Lucid still has risks with burn and execution but Uber’s endorsement adds credibility and institutions may look at the stock differently now.

1njfr5i,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 11:08:48,Uranium/Nuclear Equities irrationally sinking due to China 'ban' on NVIDIA's AI chips. The reality is uranium is in seriously short supply.,"Obviously this ban (actually the Chinese government telling Chinese companies to avoid NVIDIA's AI chips) is bringing down NVIDIA stocks today. But it looks like it is also affecting Uranium and Nuclear. Sprott and VanEck Uranium/Nuclear ETFs are down up to a half percent as I type this, for example. However, this ""instruction"" by the Chinese government *does not affect the building boom of data centres in the western world*. These data centres are still being built at a record pace in America and elsewhere.

Consider first that it is recognized that there is impending uranium shortage because of this data centre building boom and widely predicted energy shortage. There is simply not enough uranium being mined and processed today to keep up with a very real future demand.

And on top of this, there is a growing understanding that a more reliable and 'green' source of stable power is required for the next 50 years or so, until 'renewable' energy can do this. Currently green can definitely supply large amounts of power, but the stability at grid scale is still a work in progress.

Nuclear is in such high demand, that even retired nuclear generating stations are being refurbished and brought back online. And at least 5 countries in Europe are either extending the lives of current reactors, and/or are also building new ones.

Even Canada is upping its nuclear game. A sure sign that nuclear is winning, over purely wind and solar solutions. It is expanding its nuclear capacity. The Bruce Generating Station in Ontario has almost completed adding two new reactors, which will make it once again the largest nuclear generating station in the world. And Ontario's Darlington nuclear generating station (currently with 4 reactors) will be adding 4 new SMRs which was just announced by the PM. And Alberta is looking seriously at building a nuclear generating station. If Canada is doing this, nuclear is mainstream.

It is expected that an announcement can happen at the annual meeting in a couple of weeks on Sep 30 or even announced earlier.

the reason why Warren outperforms the market & loves insurance, is because insurers reinvests their profits. For Warren & Geico, they rolled their profits & reinvest into equity, which allows them to make outsized returns. Bill Ackman wants to replicate this success.

Based on his vision, a P&C insurer is his most likely choice, as reserve requirements are low which allows for reinvestment and it also follows the Geico playbook pretty well.

LMND mcap is too high(4.2B), HIPO mcap is too small & unprofitable, ROOT makes sense(1.5B) but management has always mentioned that they wanted to grow ROOT to be larger than PGR, so that is likely out of the pic, as ROOT takes the solo approach.

I do not see Bill investing in health insurance due to his past criticism of UNH. Nor is he investing in life insurance due to the higher reserve requirements. Speciality insurance is also too niched with less TAM. Also many MGA's have terrible balance sheets with negative tangible equity (GSHD, RYAN, TWFG, etc)

The focus on meeting unified eu standards is also a crucial point. this could be a massive de-risking factor and a significant moat. it's a great example of regulatory arbitrage, and a company's ability to navigate these hurdles could be a huge long-term value driver. weride has global experience, including in strict markets like japan, which suggests they can clear these regulatory obstacles.

Finally, there's the ""nvidia effect"" weride is the only company in the autonomous driving field that nvidia has directly invested in. this partnership with renault provides a fundamental basis for a long-term investment thesis, moving it beyond a purely speculative ai play.

1njdyjs,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 10:00:30,Treasury bonds are gaining popularity as today is likely the start of the first interest rate cut this year.,"***TLT*** *is highly sensitive to the rate cat. It is for the adventurous but not extremely risky*.  TLT has never been less than $80 for over 23 years.

*On the opposite end, there is* ***SGOV*** *for the super conservative who wants to store money like in a bank account.*

**Yields from Treasury bonds** and other U.S. government securities are **subject to Federal tax but exempt from state and local income taxes.**

**Here are some popular Bond ETFs:**

* **SCHO (Schwab Short-Term U.S. Treasury ETF):** Invests in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 1 and 3 years. This provides the most safety and lowest interest rate risk of the group (except SGOV), but with a lower potential yield. 
* **IEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Focuses on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 7 and 10 years. It provides a middle ground between the low risk of short-term bonds and the high volatility of long-term bonds
* **TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Concentrates on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities over 20 years. This gives it a high duration, meaning it is highly sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates.

Lyft stock rocketed 20% higher on the news.

Riders in Nashville will be able to hail a Waymo robotaxi through the Waymo One app, and Lyft will add Waymo robotaxis to its platform over time, the companies said in a joint statement on Wednesday.

Lyft “will provide end-to-end fleet management services including vehicle readiness and maintenance, infrastructure, and depot operations in Nashville,” for the Waymo fleet, the companies said.

Waymo, which is owned by Alphabet, has taken a big lead in the U.S. robotaxi market, launching in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well as Austin and Atlanta. It surpassed 10 million paid trips in May, and has plans to start commercial operations next year in Miami, Washington, D.C., Dallas, Denver, and now Nashville.

1nj9v93,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 06:54:22,China bans tech companies from buying Nvidia’s AI chips,"     China’s internet regulator has banned the country’s biggest technology companies from buying Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips, as Beijing steps up efforts to boost its domestic industry and compete with the US.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) told companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s tailor-made product for the country, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Several companies had indicated they would order tens of thousands of the RTX Pro 6000D, and had started testing and verification work with Nvidia’s server suppliers, the people said.

After receiving the CAC order, the companies told their suppliers to stop the work, the people added.

The ban goes beyond earlier guidance from regulators that focused on the H20, Nvidia’s other China-only chip widely used for AI. It comes after Chinese regulators concluded that domestic chips had attained performance comparable to those of Nvidia’s models used in China.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, told reporters in London on Wednesday that he expected to discuss the chipmaker’s ability to do business in China with Donald Trump that evening during the US president’s state visit to the UK.

“We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,” he said. “I’m disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I’m understanding of that. We are patient about it.” 

Beijing is putting pressure on Chinese tech companies to boost the country’s homegrown semiconductor industry and break their reliance on Nvidia so it can compete in an AI race against the US.

“The message is now loud and clear,” said an executive at one of the tech companies. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it’s all hands on deck to build the domestic system.”

Nvidia started producing chips tailored for the Chinese market after former US President Joe Biden banned the company from exporting its most powerful products to China, in an effort to rein in Beijing’s progress on AI.

Beijing’s regulators have recently summoned domestic chipmakers such as Huawei and Cambricon, as well as Alibaba and search engine giant Baidu, which also make their own semiconductors, to report how their products compare against Nvidia’s China chips, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.

They concluded that China’s AI processors had reached a level comparable to or exceeding that of the Nvidia products allowed under export controls, the person added.

China says Nvidia violated antitrust law when it bought Mellanox

The Financial Times reported last month that China’s chipmakers were seeking to triple the country’s total output of AI processors next year.

“The top-level consensus now is there’s going to be enough domestic supply to meet demand without having to buy Nvidia chips,” said an industry insider.

Nvidia introduced the RTX Pro 6000D in July during Huang’s visit to Beijing, when the US company also said Washington was easing its previous ban on the H20 chip.

China’s regulators, including the CAC, have warned tech companies against buying Nvidia’s H20, asking them to justify having purchased them over domestic products, the FT reported last month.

The RTX Pro 6000D, which the company has said could be used in automated manufacturing, was the last product Nvidia was allowed to sell in China in significant volumes.

Alibaba, ByteDance, the CAC and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1nirgbf,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 15:37:42,Microsoft announces $30 billion investment in AI infrastructure in UK,"Microsoft said on Tuesday that it plans to invest $30 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.K. by 2028.

The investment includes $15 billion in capital expenditures and $15 billion in its U.K. operations, Microsoft said. The company said the investment would enable it to build the U.K.’s “largest supercomputer,” with more than 23,000 advanced graphics processing units, in partnership with Nscale, a British cloud computing firm.

The spending commitment comes as President Donald Trump embarks on a state visit to Britain. Trump arrived in the U.K. Tuesday evening and is set to be greeted at Windsor Castle on Wednesday by King Charles and Queen Camilla.

During his visit, all eyes are on U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is under pressure to bring stability to the country after the exit of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over a house tax scandal and a major cabinet reshuffle.

On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said his stance on the U.K. has warmed over the years. He previously criticized the country over its attempt in 2023 to block the tech giant’s $69 billion acquisition of video game developer Activision-Blizzard. The deal was cleared by the U.K.s competition regulator later that year.

“I haven’t always been optimistic every single day about the business climate in the U.K.,” Smith said. However, he added, “I am very encouraged by the steps that the government has taken over the last few years.”

“Just a few years ago, this kind of investment would have been inconceivable because of the regulatory climate then and because there just wasn’t the need or demand for this kind of large AI investment,” Smith said.

Starmer and Trump are expected to sign a new deal Wednesday “to unlock investment and collaboration in AI, Quantum, and Nuclear technologies,” the government said in a statement late Tuesday.

Yes, if you bought during or before 2021 you likely are still down. However, if you held your nose and bought when it was trading at dirt cheap prices during Feb 2024 you’re probably pretty happy right now.

The best time to buy is when everyone says “this is Uninvestable.” For example, I think stocks like MOH and CNC could have a lot of upside, maybe some REITs like ARE or MPW have value too. 

And yes, I am well aware of the VIE structure of the BABA ADR. It is certainly a risk, but all investing comes with risk, you just need to ensure that you’re well compensated for the risk you’re taking. If it scares you, consider FXI which owns shares on the Hong Kong exchange. Full disclosure I own that too, as well as TCEHY.

The program came out of a June executive order and sets up controlled trial environments under DOT and FAA oversight. Archer will work with airlines (United is already backing them) and cities to show that its Midnight aircraft can fly quietly, safely, and at scale.

CEO Adam Goldstein called it a *“landmark moment,”* while United’s CFO said flying taxis could reshape how people move through congested cities. The trials could start as early as next year, with data feeding into certification and future expansion.

ACHR has already had a wild run this year (up over 150% YoY), but this adds another layer of federal legitimacy. Analysts keep slapping buy ratings with $13 PTs, even after the stock’s volatility.

then the Fed’s credibility is finished everyone might as well just follow Trump’s orders from now on.

Short-term turbulence is nothing compared to the ruin of future credibility; it would be shortsighted to think otherwise.

In short, if there really is a rate cut, even by 25 points, gold will truly become America’s future rather than the dollar

1nhxe5d,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 16:36:29,EchoStar (SATS) seems massively undervalued after the $17B SpaceX deal,"I look at EchoStar (SATS), and I see something very interesting. A big thing happened and I think many people do not see the real story. I think maybe the price is too low now.

So, this company had a very big problem. It had too much debt. Like a huge credit card bill that is hard to pay. But then, they sell something very valuable. They sell their invisible highways for phone signals, what people call spectrum. First, they sell some to AT&T for $23 billion. Then, they sell more to SpaceX, the Elon Musk company, for $17 billion. That is so much money. With this money, they can pay all the debt. The big problem is gone.

The deal with SpaceX is very special. EchoStar did not just get cash. They get $8.5 billion in cash, and also an $8.5 billion piece of the SpaceX company. So now, EchoStar owns a part of SpaceX. This is very exciting, because SpaceX is growing very fast with its Starlink internet from satellites.
So what is EchoStar company now? It is not the same company it was before. Before, they were trying to build a big new 5G phone network all by themselves. This was very risky and was costing so much money. Now, they stopped that plan. The company is now more simple. It is a company that just owns a few other businesses. It is much safer now.

Think of it like a box with different toys inside. What is in the box?

First, there is the TV business, with DISH and Sling. This part is getting smaller, but it still makes a lot of money, like a cash machine.

Second, the phone business, Boost Mobile. It is smaller now and will use towers from other companies. But it will have a special new power: it will use the Starlink satellites from SpaceX so customers can get signal even in the middle of nowhere.

Third, an internet business called Hughes. This part is very stable and sells internet to government and other big companies.

Fourth, the piece of SpaceX. This is the most exciting part. It is like having a ticket for a rocket ship that is already flying to the moon. SpaceX is worth so much money, maybe $400 billion or more.

And fifth, they still have more of those invisible phone highways left to sell! One big bank said this extra part could be worth almost $10 billion. They can sell this later to a company like Verizon and get even more cash.

So, I add up all these pieces. The TV business, the phone business, the internet business, the piece of SpaceX, and the extra highways they still own. When I add it all up, I think the company is worth about $32 billion. But if you look at the stock market, the price for the whole company is only about $22 billion. This is a very big difference. It means one share of the stock could be worth maybe $110, but today it is much cheaper.

The story is simple. The company had a big debt problem. They sold some things and now the problem is gone. Now they have no debt, they have businesses that make money, and they own a piece of one of the world's most exciting companies. But the stock price is still acting like the old company with the big problem. This is why I think it is very interesting.

1nhozun,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 11:28:53,How do I (27M) convince my dad (68M) to stop gambling on individual stocks?,"My dad comfortably retired around 13 years ago from a good business he owned. He was able to build a strong nest egg to coast through retirement easily, even if he just kept it in lower-interest assets yielding 3-4% per annum.

As for me, I've began my investing journey around 3 years ago and adopted a relatively conservative approach. By this I mean I hold around

* 30% cash in high-yield accounts (3-4%)
* 20% in a retirement account (6%)
* roughly 50% in a mixture of ETFs, individual stocks and crypto. Breakdown would be:
   * 35% ETFs tracking S&P500
   * 13% individual stocks
   * 2% crypto

This entire breakdown is derived from my entire net worth, I'm debt-free and projecting retirement in my early 40s.

Now going back to my dad, we've had several conversations about stocks & investments over the years, many of which have raised strong questions from me over his investing style. Let me name a few to paint a better picture:

* He's taken a nearly $2-3 million dollar loan to invest into more stocks (paid back almost half the loan)
* Majority of his investments are individual stocks, many of which consists of penny/speculative stocks that have tanked -80% all the way to delisting.
   * Huge chunk in GoPro in 2015, still holding to today with massive losses and no plans to sell and reallocate
   * Another huge chunk in (actinium pharma), which tanked nearly 90% due to not receiving FDA approval
* Several huge investments in mutual funds with high management fees (1.5-2%) which are either loss-making and barely making meaningful returns.

I was able to get hold of his spreadsheet recently to properly review his financial situation and it's extremely alarming. From my analysis, he's holding:

* 70+ individual stocks, mostly losses
* 10+ mutual funds, mostly losses

Over the last 10 months, I've created and presented two separate presentations explaining the amount of risk he's taking. I've explained the urgency of trimming his portfolio massively and reallocating into a simple index funds / bonds and even blue-chip individual stocks instead of penny stocks.

However, he has massive sunk-cost fallacy and refuses to cut his positions. He wants to wait another 6 months despite having held some of these positions over a decade. This is despite me presenting the mathematical projections that he's almost guaranteed to continue incurring huge losses holding these duds over investing in safer assets.

Does anyone have advice? I'm appaled as to how bad the damage is and whether he'll be able to repay the loan given his age.

TLDR;

1nhof8h,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 11:07:46,"LENZ Therapeutics - A high risk, high reward biotech stock","Hello r/stocks I have a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is possibly easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read?” I was just like you when I first read that. Here is what I learned.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•Target population of the US is 128 million people

	•A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year

	•The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600

⸻

Company Financial Health: Good

	•Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•I am unable to determine if their creation of this drug is protected by some type of IP or patent

	•It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•Financial health could be pressured if they fail to scale in an economical way

	•Short Interest is 30% – it is irrelevant to my thesis on this product but something you should all be aware of

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter.

1nhnjwm,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 10:35:00,Trump advocates end to quarterly earnings reports,"President Donald Trump floated the idea Monday of companies no longer providing earnings report on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is “subject to SEC approval” and would “save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”

“Did you ever hear the statement that, ‘China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!’” Trump said.

The wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.

“In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” the pair wrote.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.

Supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.

Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company into territory occupied only by Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple.

The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust ruling by a judge, whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year a district court ruled that the company held an illegal monopoly in search and related advertising.

But Judge Amit Mehta decided against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President Donald Trump congratulated the company and called it “a very good day.”

Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared to the 15% gain for the Nasdaq.

The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google’s IPO and a little more than 10 years after of the creation of Alphabet as a holding company, with Google its prime subsidiary. .

CEO Sundar Pichai was named CEO of Alphabet in 2019, replacing co-founder Larry Page. Pichai’s latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through while also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up helping Google land the recent favorable antitrust ruling. The company’s hopes of becoming a major AI player largely ride with Gemini, Google’s flagship suite of AI models.

1ngvvff,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 12:33:24,Why Par Technology Corp is a LT Buy.,"Hey Everyone,

I came across this company while reading a partnership letter of an asset management firm that allocates capital in various securities. Naturally, I was curious to learn more about it, and low and behold, it was severely undervalued with great underlying economics and management that has made decisions that have kept the company alive and is positioning itself for the future very well.

For background PAR started as a defense company and made its way into the food industry firstly offering hardware solutions, like POS items, and in the last seven years undergoing a rapid transformation into a more cloud based solutions within the food industry. The security is undervalued due to net losses in the last seven years, this is because of the rapid transformation of the company into a primary software solutions provider, which has included many acqustions to position the company to offer a unified experience from Point of sale, to payements, to commerce. Hence in recent years the company has under gone volitality from the market, yet is is important to not net loss has dramtically reduced from around 70 million in 2023 to just 5 million net loss in 24, this aligns with strong revenue growth, year over year. Management has proved that it can adapt with the moving times something that kills great companies like Kodak as a major example. (Or perhaps severely weaken their market share.) I am acknowledging that saying that profitability in the near future is speculation, but all trends point in that way. (I will attach a summary of financials below.)

The balance sheet is strong as well as assets fully outweigh liablities and the assets include the companies they acquired equating to the goodwill, and 200 million in cash as well.

They also have great business advantages, primarily the fact that companies face high switching costs once they integrate. This is more relevant than ever since PAR is offering unified experiences. This can somewhat be applied with pricing power as well.

The margin of safety is there, although it is rather hard to make predictions for growth, even conservatively, the margin of safety is quite large, i have bought at 44 a share.

1ngvaz4,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 12:11:45,Hennessy funds recommends these top 3 small caps to become GIANTS,"Josh Wein, a VP & key 5 star portfolio manager of Hennessy Funds, who manages 10 of the funds worth collectively 3B in AUM, recently mentioned that these 3 top small caps are his favorite to become giants.

**$ROOT insurance:**

ROOT insurance is an insurance company with a 1.5B market-cap that underwrites risk utilizing AI targeting safe drivers, which allows them to have less risk & better profit margins than their legacy peers. ROOT although small, has been beating legacy insurers on all metrics all around, including pricing, loss ratios, and a forward efficient tech stack. ROOT has recently partnered with the biggest names in auto including Toyota, Hyundai, CVNA, Experian, etc, which now sports 20+ major partners strong, and many more to come. Their partnership channel has been growing at 3x YoY, and you quickly realize why Josh thinks ROOT could end up being a giant one day.

**$COMP**

Compass is a tech forward real estate brokerage. the thesis is that if interest rates drop, that real estate volume will pick back up. Josh also sees similarities to Redfin where another company can come in to acquire compass for synergies. Their profit margins are higher than other brokers, due to the tech support that compass provides to their agents. Compass has 33,000+ agents.

**$WMK Weis Markets Inc**

Weis Markets operates a chain of supermarkets with over 200 stores. Currently has a 1.75B market cap. Currently runs at a 17.64 P/E. has steady growth in assets, revenue, and offers a dividend. The thought behind this, is buying Weis in thoughts of it becoming the next Walmart. Though, growth hasn't been strong enough to support the thesis.

are there any other small caps that you would suggest other than what Wein has recommended?",0,14,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngvaz4/hennessy_funds_recommends_these_top_3_small_caps/,new,Unknown,0.42

A quick question: out of the Mag 7, which do you think have the largest and lowest downside potential in case AI does not turn out to be the goldmine many think/thought it could be?

There are increasing concerns around the current version of AI (LLMs) being limited and not able to reach AGI (see, for instance, Yann Lecun’s take on it), coupled with concerns around monetisation (or, at least, monetisation in a scale compatible with providing good returns on the huge capital being invested), hence my question.

I think Nvidia is the top loser in that scenario, and Tesla the least exposed. Not sure about the other ones.

1ngogkq,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 07:06:03,Stock buybacks--Why are they happening and what do they imply for regular investors?,"I just saw that companies are buying back their own stock at a record pace, and this activity represented 6 times the volume of households buying in the market in 2024.  This is mind-blowing, and I can see a few ways to take it.  Also, I might be missing the point or the info might be misleading.  For example, how did they count my money managed by Vanguard or whoever in my 401k?

1-It could mean that the companies think their own stocks are drastically undervalued, and that might imply that despite measures like P/E ratio sending us the signal that the market is overvalued, the people in the know see it differently.  However, counter-intuitively, the chart I found showed that buybacks were lowest in the 2008 crash and the covid drop.  Those are the times that the companies' management should have seen their stocks as undervalued.  Maybe they were too focused on survival at that point to find the cash for buybacks(?) 

2-It could imply that they are using the buyback strategy as a substitute for investing in the future of their companies.  Perhaps they are trying to get the price up to catch a bonus, to increase the value of their own holdings, or just to give shareholders good feelings about their management as they see the price go up.

3-It could imply that the managers of these companies see few opportunities for investment, and they are just 'circling the airport', waiting for opportunities to come along in the future.  Maybe this could mean that a crash is likely in the near future.

Am I correct to think that today's levels of buybacks are unprecedented?  What is driving them?  What do they imply that rational individual investors should do in response, if anything?",15,98,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngogkq/stock_buybackswhy_are_they_happening_and_what_do/,new,Unknown,0.62

1nfl6jr,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 21:47:41,My thoughts on PAR.,"Hey Everyone,

So i have been looking for undervalued securities, and often you find investement ideas in niche places, from value line, to barrons, to in my case a interview with a founder of a asset management firm. The founder brought up PAR, and naturally my curiosity spiked, i went to check out the company as of now. This is will be pretty unformal so please bare with. The company has been loosing money as of late, which has relativley been the main factor in poor investor sentiment, and the whole reason the company is so undervalued in the first place. They have been loosing money primarily, because they are agressivley trying to acquire market share. PAR is a technology company that offers solutions to food businesses out of while tropical cafe and arbys are customers. I like this business because i know there are naturally high switching costs, and pricing power is strong. They have collectivley acquired different businesses from payments to commerce to really provide a unified expeirience to customers. Management competency is pretty high, Savneet Singh is the CEO and is track record is respectable to say the least. And i since the current price is at the 52 week low, it seems foolish not to put a shitload in the business, i see a long term oppurtunity, conservative dcf calculations seem to predict 10 year share prices of 110 of course this will vary individual to indiviual. So yeah for me PAR is a strong strong buy.

I bought RDDT at IPO and have been holding, because I believed in the company, and still believe that it’s a well run company with a good strategy for growth/monetization.

However, the Trump administration is putting their hands all over corporate America, and almost every large corporation is following the White House’s bidding, because no one wants to be on the wrong side of a fight with the entire federal government. Anyone that goes against the President could be faced with lawsuits, loss of contracts, having mergers/acquisitions blocked, etc. Look at how many concessions Paramount had to give the White House before their merger could be approved!

After the Charlie Kirk assassination, the American right-wing is PISSED, and swearing vengeance against “the violent left.” High ranking officials, including the President himself, are promising to root out left wing ideas. They’ve already organized extremely fast to get people and organizations investigated, suspended, and fired - https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/us/politics/charlie-kirk-shooting-firings-celebration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare

Reddit is the highest profile left-leaning social media. Multiple high profile conservatives are already angry about the highly upvoted posts that are sympathetic to the killing. Just look at the most upvoted posts yesterday on any default sub.

I think it will only be a matter of time before this sentiment about Reddit reaches the White House, and they will force Reddit to adopt changes that are favorable to the administration, such as shutting down certain subreddits, overhauling the moderation strategy, or even demanding sensitive details about certain users. If Reddit abides, it could severely impact Reddit’s growth strategy as left-leaning users find other platforms.

1nfgpnp,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 18:19:53,Finally leaving Robinhood after a decade,"I was part of the original batch of users when Robinhood was first teased online. Back then zero commission trading was unheard of. As a 21 year old trying to buy Tesla, logging into Scotttrade and paying commissions every single time felt like a huge barrier. Robinhood completely changed that and honestly changed the whole industry for the better.

But the app today feels very different. It has turned into a so called “super app” that constantly pushes Gold, nags you to roll over retirement accounts, and adds features that feel more like gambling than investing. The contract trading section especially just seems predatory.

I stuck with Robinhood through everything. I was not even mad during the GameStop Citadel mess when trading was locked. I defended them and even made YouTube videos back in the day recommending Robinhood to beginners.

This morning I finally moved everything to Fidelity with an ACATS transfer. I also signed up for their 2 percent cash back credit card and will funnel the rewards into index funds. At this point it just feels like the smarter move for where I am now.

Not trying to convince anyone, but after nearly a decade it feels like closing a chapter. Maybe I just grew up.


Edit: Wow, I didn’t expect so many Robinhood fans to chime in. To be clear, I was a fan too! The app just doesn’t sit right with me anymore. I’m not doing anything fancy like options these days. I’m a pretty passive investor now, mainly just buying two companies through my brokerage since my other accounts are already handling the index fund side. Really appreciate all the perspectives though. And yeah, I have to admit the Fidelity app and website feel a little old school, but hey… at least it’s better than Vanguard’s lol.",502,289,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfgpnp/finally_leaving_robinhood_after_a_decade/,new,Industry Discussion,0.88

> Shares of Pfizer and Moderna fell on Friday after a report that Trump administration health officials plan to link Covid vaccines to the deaths of 25 children.  The report from the Washington Post said officials plan to include the claim in a presentation next week to a key vaccine panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That committee plays a critical role in determining vaccine access, as it reviews immunization data and makes recommendations on who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other duties. But the presentation to that panel is not final, the Post reported. “FDA and CDC staff routinely analyze VAERS and other safety monitoring data, and those reviews are being shared publicly through the established ACIP process,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement, referring to the panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. “Until that is shared publicly, any this should be considered pure speculation,” the spokesperson added.

> Pfizer’s stock fell more than 3% on Friday, while shares of Moderna dropped more than 7%. Novavax, which creates protein-based Covid shots, slid more than 4%. The report comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moves to change vaccine policy in the U.S. He has dropped Covid shot recommendations for healthy kids and pregnant women and set new limits on the approval of new jabs against the virus. In a statement, Moderna said the safety of its vaccine is “rigorously monitored” by the company, the FDA and regulators in more than 90 countries. Systems across the U.S., Australia, Canada and Europe have not identified “any new or undisclosed safety concerns in children or in pregnant women,” Moderna added.",930,166,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfg181/pfizer_moderna_shares_fall_on_report_that_trump/,new,Unknown,0.97

1nfa1qo,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 13:55:45,Follow-up: Why flu vaccine economics shouldn’t apply to Cidara’s (CDTX) CD388 universal flu prophylaxis,"In response to my earlier post asking if Cidara’s (CDTX) CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” was the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market ([CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), I received a number of comments that begged the question:  Why should CD388 be priced any differently than flu vaccines?

This question is worthy of a deeper dive to explain why I think why vaccine economics should not apply to CD388:

1. CD388 isn’t a vaccine! It **doesn’t depend on the immune system**, so what this means in practical terms is that **it will work** just as **well for people that have weakened immune systems**, like the elderly, cancer patients, or people with other diseases that suppress immune function, as it will for healthy people.
2. CD388 is **flu strain agnostic**, whereas vaccines need to be reformulated yearly in the hopes of matching the most active strains.  For folks with weakened immune systems and at high risk of complications from the flu, the seasonal uncertainty of protection from vaccines translates to risk, and this risk translates to lifestyle changes (like wearing a mask and staying home) that have a serious impact on quality of life.
3. **CD388 works pretty much right away**, whereas it generally takes a couple of weeks for healthy immune systems to build up immunity after exposure to a vaccine.  This means people most at risk will be able to be confident that they’re protected soon after receiving CD388 and will stay protected through the flu season.
4. The effect of **CD388 is additive to vaccines**!  In terms of protecting the most at-risk population, this means that vaccines and CD388 can be used together to maximize protection against disease.

The key point here is that if the effectiveness of CD388 demonstrated in Cidara's 5000+ person-strong phase 2b holds for their phase 3 trial, they will have a drug that, for the population for which the flu disease burden is highest (i.e., where there is higher risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death), is far more effective than available flu vaccines.   Not only more effective, but additive to current vaccines.  Vaccines alone don’t deliver this same benefit to this population and so don't have the same value – economic or otherwise.  That’s why the company believes that a mAb prophylaxis like Beyfortus, not a flu vaccine, is a better reference for CD388 pricing.

Although I only included this high risk population in my original TAM calculation, the fact that CD388 is pan-influenza and applicable to H5 (Bird flu) strains, and that it works near-instantly, makes it an obvious candidate as a medical countermeasure for pandemic preparedness.   There is no doubt that stockpiling at scale for the masses would drive a different pricing regime, consistent with the volumes that can be expected for such stockpiles.  I excluded this “icing on the cake” from my previous analysis, however, simply because the numbers just leave me shaking my head in disbelief! I’ll leave that analysis for when and if BARDA gives us a hint of what that stockpiling might be worth.

Bottom line, I am still looking for the definitive answer to my original question: Is Cidara's CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market?  Some of the feedback I’ve received suggest that its current discount reflects its development stage, but my valuation math already considers a measured probability of success (or failure).   Does a 60%-80% discount on top of my already risk-managed rNPV really make sense?

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1nex7fd,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 03:56:29,Puts on Duolingo,"Been watching this stock for a while.

It had a surge yesterday and is now sitting at $310, still down from its ath of $545. This upward movement came from 2 analysts increasing their price target to $400.

It had a similar spike back on August 18th when it increased to $370, which was then followed by a large sell off down to $270. Same reason, an analyst made an upgrade.

Being that its still in a bearish trend, I view this spike in share price as a good time to buy puts, curious what yall think?

I think it will continue down the rest of this month, but may rally leading up to earnings.

1nev4bo,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 01:42:12,NASDAQ wants to tokenize stocks… are they just late to the party?,"When Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs finally got approved, it felt like TradFi was pulling crypto into its world.
But with Nasdaq now asking the SEC to allow trading tokenized stocks, the roles might be reversing: traditional finance is moving into blockchain territory.

What stands out is that tokenization isn’t new.

Crypto platforms have already been experimenting with RWA products for a while  from tokenized bonds to futures tied to stocks like TSLA or NVDA.

These products weren’t perfect, but they proved the concept and attracted real user demand.


Now, Nasdaq itself wants in, asking regulators to approve rule changes so tokenized stocks can trade alongside traditional ones, under the same conditions. That’s a massive shift in narrative: Wall Street isn’t just watching RWA anymore, it wants to own it.

So here’s the open question:

If Wall Street starts pushing tokenized equities and bonds, will crypto platforms that pioneered these products (like Bitget with its RWA index futures) still have an edge?

Or will the traditional markets simply absorb the idea and leave Web3 players behind?

1nes68a,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 22:57:35,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don’t make money, they burn money, so it’s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it’s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it’s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm’s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it’s going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won’t be pretty. The warning signs are already showing.

WASHINGTON (AP) - In another grim sign for the U.S. labor market, jobless claim applications jumped to their highest level in almost four years last week, virtually assuring the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate next week.

The index for all items less food and energy increased 0.3 percent in August (SA); up 3.1 percent over the year (NSA).""

The expected inflation, combined with an increasingly weak job market, sets the stage for the expected next week's Fed interest rate cut. There was a 92% chance of a 25 bp cut and 8% chance of a 50 bp cut prior to this morning's CPI report.

Wall Street is looking forward to a more aggressive trajectory of rate cuts alongside the slowing jobs market.  A growing number of economists now forecast a quarter-point rate cut at each of this year’s three remaining meetings, instead of just two cuts. 

""The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.4 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in August, after rising 0.2 percent in July, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today.

The index for shelter rose 0.4 percent in August and was the largest factor in the all items monthly increase. The food index increased 0.5 percent over the month as the food at home index rose 0.6 percent and the food away from home index increased 0.3 percent. The index for energy rose 0.7 percent in August as the index for gasoline increased 1.9 percent over the month.

The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.3 percent in August, as it did in July.

I'll prove it.","**TL;DR: I believe $BYRN will pop off on or before their earnings call on October 8th.** Shorts are trying to convince you that a company with 57% revenue growth and frankly explosive profits is a bad bet. They are wrong.


    Standard play: $BYRN shares currently $19-20;
    
    Budget play 1: 10/17 25c currently ~$0.65;
    
    Budget play 2: 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80. 


\---------------------------------------------------

In 2023, I started value investing again. Responsibly. Just a bit. And long story short, I found BYRN. I've been holding it since it was $4. After their 2025 first quarter earnings, they spiked to around $34, where I took profits. But then the stock sank. And sank some more. For no reason. So I bought back. And so should you.

Disclaimer: I couldn't post this in WSB because BYRN is at $475mm market cap and doesn't meet the $500mm minimum requirement. Hopefully tomorrow I can post there too.

---
- *Quick rundown of Byrna.  It's a nonlethal gun (""launcher"") company that gained attention after Google banned them from advertising on their platforms in 2023 for promoting violence. Ironic. Police departments worldwide are using it now, and the Streisand effect is gaining them more and more contracts. Their CMRO is genuinely goated, most recently securing a deal with Sportsman's Warehouse to have in-store Byrna demo rooms. It's been a massive success, as you'll see below. They have*  ***zero debt and positive income***.

---

Seriously though, there's like literally no reason it's being suppressed at $20. I have reason to believe there's some bullshittery happening here. Here I shall present to you my thesis on their October 8th earnings call. Fun fact, I typed this entire thing myself. No AI.

So you're doubtful? Nah bruh. LOOK at the

###Fundamentals:

**Tariff resistance stats:** 100% ammo production in the USA. 92% launcher production in the USA.

**Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $26.2 million (57% increase from $16.7 million)
    Gross Profit: $15.9 million (61% of revenue)
    Net Income: $1.7 million (9900% increase from $17,000)

**Q2 2025 vs. Q2 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $28.5 million (41% increase from $20.3 million)
    Gross Profit: $17.6 million (62% of revenue)
    Net Income: $2.4 million (14% increase from $2.1 million)


**Q3 2025 vs. Q3 2024 (Preliminary)**:

    Net Revenue: $28.2 million (35% increase from $20.9 million)
     - Driven by a 147% increase in chain store and dealer channels (wtf)
    Web sales increased by 8%.
    International sales grew by 33%.

Like please. In one of the most turbulent economic chapters in US history, BYRN is STILL ramping its sales and margins. And yet, the stock is hovering around $20. My best guess is, your average retail investor isn't who is shorting it. It's someone else. Possibly a hedge fund, because 66% of BYRN is owned by institutional investors who don't give enough of a shit to short it.

I've been tracking this stock for 2 years now. People are catching on. Remember, these guys were trading at $4 in 2023. Every single one of their C level execs is amazing. Analyst price targets are between $35 and $46. The company is officially profitable, and income is consistently in the black. But the stock is marooned at $20. I couldn't make sense of it, because I don't like conspiracy theories. But it kept happening. For MONTHS.

###The Short ""Interest""

Yeah, we're a bit allergic to the term ""shorts"" these days. I get it. But... I have to call it out. Because as of August 15th, the short interest on BYRN was 4.08 million shares, or 23.1% of the total float. ***Nearly a quarter of the company’s publicly traded shares are being shorted.***

##***23.1% short interest on a profitable, zero debt company.*** WHAT.

> **They use AI in their marketing...**

- The target market for the AI ads are boomers who shop at Sportsman’s Warehouse. They can’t tell the difference between AI and a real video, and they don’t care. I literally sent my parents the video and asked them what was wrong with it. My mom said ""it was a wonderful ad, very clever"". Bullish.

> **The economy is uncertain...**

- BYRN is nearly immune to tariffs. See Tariff Resist Stats above. The fact that the stock moves on tariff news is honestly dumb as heck, but we live in the world of algos now. Bullish, but also I'm a bit pissed about this.

> **They're burning cash...**

- Yep. New product release (Byrna CL), they're burning cash to stockpile and advertise it. And they're still in the black. AND it’s working. Gotta spend money to make money. Bullish.


The preliminary earnings for Q3 are already out, and they are fantastic. The only thing left to be revealed in October is the EPS, and I’m betting 30k shares that it’s going to be another profitable quarter.

Why am I writing this all out? Because I want someone else other than me to be interested in this. BYRN is an obviously overlooked company. I rode the wave from $4 without saying a word and waiting for talking heads from Yahoo.com to spread the news. But lately I've been thinking, there's a big value play here, and it's happening because somebody with a lot of money somewhere made a mistake and needs time to unload. I'm expecting it to run up to somewhere from $35-$45. Am I crazy? Can someone stop me because I want to throw 100% of my portfolio into this baddie. I'm actually simping for this company so hard its crazy.

###Plays to take advantage of this (I did all 3):

1. 10/17 25c currently ~$0.60-$0.90

2. Buy the stock. Currently hovering between $19-$21

**$SOUN** provides voice enabled platforms for cars, restaurants, and customer support. They sell voice solutions to businesses. It’s still early stage and not fully profitable, but the growth potential is there.

**$OPEN** is a tech driven home buying and selling company. They give homeowners instant cash offers, flip houses, and offer extra services like title and escrow. Their revenue swings a lot with housing market cycles and management moves.

**$RR** makes service robots for hospitality, restaurants, warehouses, and cleaning. Some robots handle drinks, deliveries, or cleaning, basically taking over repetitive human tasks. Deployment is growing, but profitability is still in the early stages.

All three companies are using technology or systems to replace or streamline traditional processes. None of them are rock solid profitable yet, so stock swings can be wild. News, market sentiment, or sector trends can make big moves in either direction. Their solutions have large potential markets. Voice platforms can be scaled across industries, Opendoor targets the massive US housing market, and RR’s robots can be applied wherever service humans are needed.

Of course, there are risks, costs are high (development, deployment, maintenance), market adoption isn’t guaranteed, competition is fierce, and management/operational risks exist (e.g., OPEN had CEO changes recently).

So, yeah, they're not the same companies, but they are all future, AI + automation or robotics. Could be fun to watch if you'd like speculative trades,  but don't be fooled, they are not low risk.

In Robinhood, I’d probably just hold VTI because they do not have VTSAX, and I feel like one huge advantage to this is being able to buy IPOs when they release, as they seem to be constantly doubling these days. Also, Robinhood makes it significantly easier to sell and buy shares of stock.

1ndt2go,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 19:04:16,"CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?","New to reddit and looking for a second set of eyes on one of my investments.

I’ve been digging into Cidara ($CDTX), which is developing CD388, a once-per-season prophylaxis for influenza. Essentially a “universal flu med” for high-risk groups (elderly, immunocompromised, diabetics) where vaccines don't work well. It recently came out of a large phase 2b trial with ""game-changer"" efficacy results and will soon be moving on to phase 3.

Share price today: ~$63/share × ~42M FD shares (fully diluted) = ~$2.7B valuation.

Note: It perked up a bit today (and promptly settled back down), I suspect because the company mentioned yesterday to investors at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference that they were very happy with how their end of phase 2b meeting with the FDA in August went. Also, their phase 3, which was supposed to start in the spring 2026, is now posted on clinicaltrials.gov as starting this fall. No official PR from Cidara yet, but it seems some good news is coming.

Anyway, here's my math on valuation (conservative inputs):

TAM for CD388: ~285M high-risk in WHO high-income countries (CDC/WHO data, overlap-adjusted). I am extrapolating from the company's US-only data because it seems silly to think a universal flu drug that works well and is safe will only sell in the US.

Pricing: Anchored to long-acting prophylactics (like Beyfortus RSV mAb), not cheap antivirals. U.S. ~$495/dose, ex-U.S. ~$225 → ~$280 weighted avg. (company has done market research and projects confidence that payers will cover at these price points. The ex. US assumption is my own, but follows typical patters of 50% reduction outside US).

COGS: ~$70/dose (figure mentioned by CFO in recent presentation, better as they scale production) → ~75% gross margin. Net margin assumed at 25% (in line with biologics).

Uptake: 25% peak (~71M treated). For context: flu vaccine coverage = ~45% of U.S. adults, ~70% of seniors. So 25% feels skeptical, not aggressive. I more realistic number would be to match vaccine uptake in this high-risk population, but I'm trying to keep this conservative.

Valuation (rNPV): Launch 2028 (potential timing for approval also mentioned by CEO in above conference), patent to 2039, biosimilar erosion by 2042. Discount 10%, PoS 75%. Outcome = ~$22B NPV → $445–530/share!

That's a big number for a clinical stage biotech, but this is a universal flu play! And Cidara is also a platform play with an oncology med based on the same DFC platform waiting in the wings, so maybe it should at least get some optionality out of that.

So my question: why the disconnect?

Is it just “clinical-stage biotech = high risk” until Phase 3 reads out?

Are institutions deliberately keeping this quiet until they’re positioned? (huge institutional interest vs. small free retail float)

Is the market over-discounting dilution, competition, or BARDA uncertainty?

From where I sit, the numbers look like 7–8× upside, but the stock sits flat at $62-$64.

Curious to hear from this community: what am I missing? Why does the market price CD388 so conservatively when even cautious rNPV with risk levers turned up points so much higher?

**For discussion only. This is a question, and not investment advice! I hold shares of $CDTX.**

1ndkcue,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 13:18:00,WeRide – Quietly Crushing the Autonomous Driving Game,"Alright, let’s talk about a ticker nobody’s giving enough love: WeRide ($WRD).

Yeah, their earnings were 2 months ago, but sometimes you gotta let the hype die down and actually look at the numbers. And holy hell, these guys are quietly building one of the strongest plays in autonomous driving.

Q2 ‘25 Recap:

* Total revenue hit $17.8M, up 60% YoY.
* Robotaxi revenue exploded +836% YoY to $6.4M. That’s now over a third of their total business – it’s not a “pilot program” anymore, it’s a legit revenue driver.
* Gross profit climbed 40% YoY, with gross margin sitting pretty at 28%. Scaling AND getting more efficient. Most of their competitors can’t say that.
* They dropped HPC 3.0, running on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor. This isn’t just marketing fluff – it cuts system cost in half while keeping it fully automotive-grade. Lower costs + better scalability = every fleet rollout becomes more profitable.
* Market Cap still only 2.7 Billion - potential 10x in coming years

Global footprint (bigger than most people realize):

* Abu Dhabi: robotaxi fleet tripled since Dec ‘24. Over 2,200 days of safe ops – regulators love that.
* Saudi Arabia: first company to run robotaxis in Riyadh. Major flex in the Middle East.
* Singapur: First operating autonomous vehicle without a safety driver in South-East Asia
* Permits in 6 countries.
* Uber and Grab partnership: the real kicker. WeRide’s tech is getting plugged into Uber’s and Grab's ecosystems, with plans for 15 cities outside US/China in the next 5 years. Uber also tossed in a $100M investment.

People sleep on this – WeRide isn’t just pushing one product. They’ve got:

* Robotaxis (obviously)
* Robobusses
* Robovans (autonomous logistics/delivery)
* Robosweepers (city sanitation, already deployed)
* Other mobility/transport solutions, all running on the WeRide One Platform.

That means multiple revenue streams across mobility + logistics + smart city services. They’re building an ecosystem.

Look, the stock isn’t mooning *yet*. They’re still in growth mode, and yes, net income is red. But think about it: massive YoY growth, global ops scaling, partnerships with Uber, Grab, Lenovo and NVIDIA, and a diversified portfolio. Compare that to the other AV players stuck in testing loops or bleeding cash without a clear roadmap.

This is how a long game looks – grab market share, get permits, build trust with regulators, diversify products, line up big-name partners, and then ride the revenue curve.

TL;DR  
2 months after earnings and I’m still hyped:

* Revenue up 60%, robotaxi rev up 836%.
* NVIDIA-powered HPC 3.0 = cheaper, faster scaling.
* Global expansion (Abu Dhabi, Saudi, Singapur, 6 permits worldwide).
* Uber deal with $100M backing.
* Broad product lineup beyond taxis.

I’m not saying it’s going 10x overnight, but this smells like a sleeper growth stock that’ll sneak up on everyone. While the herd chases Tesla and Waymo FSD headlines, WeRide is quietly racking up cities, fleets, and partnerships.",26,15,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndkcue/weride_quietly_crushing_the_autonomous_driving/,new,Company Analysis,0.74

The company said it has $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 359% from a year earlier.

1ndeclp,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 09:33:52,Broadcom Cements Its AI Credentials,"**Broadcom (AVGO) $342**

I first bought Broadcom more than a year ago for $150, and added more yesterday around $340, deciding to take the plunge after holding on and realizing that the price wouldn’t come down.

Broadcom (AVGO) the second largest AI chipmaker, and the leader by far in custom GPUs, and datacenter networking gear declared July quarter results that just passed estimates by a whisker.

The stock, however, rallied massively the next day as the ebullient CEO, Hock Tan talked up a massive $110Bn backlog , a new $10Bn customer and an expanding TAM for custom silicon and datacenter networking.

**The quarterly results and guidance at a glance**

* Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.69 beat by $0.03.
* Revenue of $15.95Bn (+22.0% YoY) beat by $130Mn. Broadcom’s revenue growth rest on two pillars, AI 32% and VMware 36% of sales, so an overall 22% growth is  excellent for the company.
* Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7Bn, with a 67% margin.
* A massive cash haul of 7.2Bn less Capex of just $142Mn, gave it an FCF of $7 Bn or 44% of revenue – **Very impressive.**

**Guidance was also close to estimates on supply constraints.**

The good stuff came during the earnings call, which was much more illuminating; CEO Hock Tan was very enthused about AI prospects, and talked about sufficiently faster growth and a massive backlog of $110Bn, plus he confirmed adding a new customer, rumored to be OpenAI.

This is one company and CEO, I respect tremendously. Hock Tan whose tenure was extended to 2030 by the board always talks up a big game; more importantly he delivers like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Arista Networks', Jayshree Ullal. 

**From Broadcom’s Q3 Earnings call:**

>

**Broadcom’s strengths and positive catalysts**

**AI revenue share keeps rising:** The share of AI revenue has gone up to an estimated 32-33% of FY2025 sales from 24% last year and based on management’s confidence in Ethernet and custom silicon scale ups and scale outs it should grow to $34Bn in FY2026, or 43% of sales and $56Bn in FY2027 or 61% of total sales. Broadcom’s sales and earnings multiples expand with each percentage increase of AI in the total mix.

**Ethernet can increase market share:** Management believes that hyperscalers prefer Ethernet “as one single fabric for both scale-out and scale-up,” and Broadcom’s Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers, and NICs can continue to grow and gain datacenter connectivity share over competitors like Nvidia, Arista Networks and Marvell.

**High margin SaaS continues to grow:** VMware continues to be a pillar of strength, with 17% high margin revenue growth. Besides, Broadcom is positioning VMware as an integrated AI solution with custom silicon.

**Strong margins:** Broadcom has strong 37% adjusted operating and 44% operating cash flow margins.

**Increasing TAM:** Previously, management had indicated that FY2026 AI revenue growth might be similar to FY2025 (roughly +50–60% YoY). But now, with the addition of a fourth hyperscaler, Broadcom’s 2026’s AI growth to “accelerate” beyond that rate, likely between 60 and 70%. The new $10Bn+ XPU customer has moved to production for AI server racks with shipments scheduled to begin in Q3 FY2026. This deal suggests several million custom AI chips could be delivered, aimed at AI inference workloads, which is the next big frontier as it takes over from training, and cements Broadcom as one of the biggest and preferred inference players.  Inference requires significantly more tokenization than training, which means hyperscalers will have to continue investing, to continue getting higher throughput at lower costs, which is key to Broadcom’s success. The $110Bn backlog that Tan spoke of confirms that this demand is much higher than anticipated.

**Broadcom’s biggest challenge is valuation, 20x FY2026 sales growing at 22%, leaves it with little room for error. It is priced to perfection.**",27,8,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndeclp/broadcom_cements_its_ai_credentials/,new,Company Discussion,0.81

I was still exploring into industries like BNPL which are really popular in poorer SEA countries (in Thailand where I live, the government warns that people are using BNPL to pay for food and groceries), and traveling (one redditor raised traveling as another thing to look out for, and from my observation it seems most Gen Z's seem to travel a lot, I see people taking a trip to Japan. I even plan one myself later this year). I ruled out Gaming and Alcoholism. (There was RBLX mentioned too, and it's been doing well this year)  
  
While I was thinking about Escapism, It hit me that I, too, am one of the target demographic. There is a raising trend about Gen Z who take their finances much more seriously than previous generations. Crypto, trading, stocks are becoming common words. I started investing back when I was 22-23, now I'm 28 and it's changed my life trajectory massively. There are probably many who are also doing this. a gen Z investor/customer will mean a lifetime of commission/fees if a service can make them stick long term.

I'm not familiar with all the financial service or other non-stock space. My initial thought is obviously my broker: IBKR. I've been using their service since 2021 and I'm very happy with them. They have lower fees and global reach for both markets and clients. The financial knowledge in the US is likely the highest of the world, all the cheapest index funds and competitive brokerages are over there. I think the rest of the world will slowly catch up, which could mean positive outlook for IBKR who's positioned to benefit the most from the rise of retail investing (outside of maybe S&P 500 itself due to all the money flowing over there). Coinbase is another that comes to my mind but I haven't looked into it.

I want to hear your thoughts. Which stocks or industries do you think will directly or indirectly benefit the most from the rise of retail investing? 

Thank you again for reading!

NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices settled higher on Tuesday after the Israeli military said it carried out an attack on Hamas leadership in the Qatari capital Doha, an expansion of its military actions in the Middle East.

Brent crude futures settled 37 cents, or 0.6%, higher at $66.39 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures also climbed 37 cents, or 0.6%, to close at $62.63 a barrel.

Both benchmarks had gained almost 2% shortly after the Israeli attack on Qatar, but gave up the majority of those gains later as the United States assured Doha that such a thing would not happen again on its soil.

""Both the U.S. and Qatar have made it clear they are not seeking further escalation, while the muted reaction from other (Gulf Cooperation Council) members reinforces the view that the risk of a wider regional flare-up remains contained,"" said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.""

For now, geopolitical risk premiums are easing rather than building,"" Leon said.

Oil prices also pared some gains because the attack did not create any immediate supply disruption, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.

The oil benchmarks were trading higher prior to the attack on Qatar, supported by the latest oil output increase from OPEC+ being smaller than anticipated, expectations that China will continue stockpiling oil and concerns over potential new sanctions against Russia.",27,1,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nd7rzv/oil_settles_higher_after_israeli_attack_on_qatar/,new,Industry News,0.84

1nd1djr,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 21:37:26,Nebius Moves To The Big Leagues,"**The $17.4Bn to $19.4Bn Nebius - Microsoft Deal**

NBIS ($96)

**This is a tremendous deal for Nebius.**

My investment thesis for Nebius was based on its technical/engineering strengths as a medium sized Neocloud provider democratizing AI infrastructure for medium sized businesses who did not want or need to pay exorbitant fees to AWS or the other hyperscalers. Prior to this deal, its biggest customer was Shopify and it was well on its way to expanding its reach to companies at, or below Shopify’s size.

**Nebius' competitive advantages:** Its biggest strengths lie in its full software stack, honed by decades of engineering talent from the ex Yandex team, instead of being a brute provider of GPU‘s in scale like Coreweave, which meant that it had the competitive advantage of not being sucked into lower pricing from just renting out GPUs. It could command a higher price and margin than other Neocloud providers, by focusing more on providing a platform and a superior stack of solutions, plus its customers were supposed to be smaller, giving it more bargaining power. Its second competitive advantage is its strategic relationship with Nvidia, which allows it to commit and guarantee computing power, the way it did with Microsoft. It has the GPUs and the datacenter infrastructure to ensure that there are no supply constraints or bottlenecks.

**Excellent Return On Investment**: Prior to this deal, its estimated sales growth was $0.6Bn in 2025, growing to $9Bn by 2030, and my target was 8X sales or a market cap of $72Bn, which was about 5x the market cap of $15Bn it was selling at till yesterday - so an almost 5x return over 5 years or 37% per year. **Pretty hefty.**

**Even better ROI:** A deal of $18Bn at mid-point clearly changes these estimates and I’m conservatively forecasting the six year deal adds at least $2Bn to revenue each year. And of course, they will get growth from other clients, a massive deal like this gives them even more cachet - my revised sales target for 2030 is $13.5Bn, valuing Nebius at 10x sales = $135Bn. CEO, Arkady Volozh calls this just the beginning, and so far he has walked the talk. At $135Bn we could be looking at almost 7x the current market cap of $22.6Bn (at a price of$95), or a return of 42% per year.

**Need to raise capital:** They will need to raise at least $3-5Bn in the next 2-3 years from both debt and equity, to play in the majors, but what’s also amazing is that they are financing this with Microsoft’s cash and credit, which means the dilution/interest payments will not be that high. Nebius still comes out way ahead with another 30% increase in share count, if needed at this price. Coreweave has $7.5 billion in long-term debt with about $7 billion in sales in 2025 with around $30 billion worth of contracts, and their growth trajectory confirms that capital raises are absolutely necessary for Neoclouds to thrive. 

**Adding more shares:** I was very content to hold and even sold off some in the mid-sixties after getting 2.6x my purchase price of $23, but now I think the stock is still worth buying even though it has shot up 45% in a day, considering where this company could go in the next five years. This deal actually validates my original thesis and I have no qualms about pyramiding (adding smaller quantities) to my holding.  
**To be sure, this increases the risks and challenges, namely execution, reduction in AI demand, enhanced competition, and dilution, but I think the risks are worth it.**",58,27,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nd1djr/nebius_moves_to_the_big_leagues/,new,Company Discussion,0.86

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.47 adjusted vs. $1.48 expected
* **Revenue:** $14.93 billion vs. $15.04 billion expected

Revenue increased 12% from a year earlier during the quarter, which ended on Aug. 31, according to a statement. Net income was about flat at $2.93 billion, or $1.01 per share, compared to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Oracle said its remaining performance obligation, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been contracted, now stands at $455 billion, up some 359% from a year earlier. During the quarter OpenAI said it signed an agreement with Oracle to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity.

Alongside larger cloud providers such as Microsoft, Oracle has been one of the big winners of the AI boom, due to its cloud infrastructure business and its access to Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) needed for large workloads. CEO Safra Catz said in the statement that the company signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the quarter.

Also in the quarter, Oracle said cloud rival Google’s Gemini artificial intelligence models would become available on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure.

Oracle shares hit a record last month and are up 45% in 2025 as of Tuesday’s close, while the S&P 500 index has gained 11%.

They got in a pissing match with an FDA official, and long story short, it’s still ongoing but in a detente. They have huge political support, as well as support from families of the kids suffering from this. The FDA pulled their therapy, yet shortly after, put it back on the market. 

There is no other solution for kids suffering from DMD, and nothing in the near or medium term either. If they can continue to keep their drug on the market and if they’re allowed to sell it to non-ambulatory patients again (perhaps in conjunction with some liver-protecting drugs) the stock could potentially go back to triple digits.

**1. First to Market, first to revenue**

While Joby and Archer are still in the FAA certification process, EHang has already achieved its equivalent in China. They hold the Type Certificate, Production Certificate, and a standard Airworthiness Certificate from the CAAC for their EH216-S model. It has allowed them to be the first in the world to launch commercial, passenger-carrying eVTOL operations. EHang has a full year of revenue-generating flights under its belt and what appears to be a growing order book. Joby and Archer, for all their progress, are still effectively pre-revenue companies on the passenger side. To me, this is a considerable edge over them, as they actually have something on the market now. 

**2. A much more favourable environment**

EHang operates in a region that is actively championing the growth of the ""low-altitude economy."" The Chinese government and various local municipalities are partnering with EHang, providing financial support and, most importantly, a clear and streamlined regulatory pathway. This contrasts sharply with the challenges in the United States and Europe, where there are way more regulatory roadblock, NIMBY sentiments, and a general mindset that is more cautious towards new technologies. 

In my opinion, this is crucial, as if you really think about it, the current certifications hurdles are just the start for Western companies, as building the infrastructure for EVTOLs will definitely be met with a lot of resistance, flight routes will be considered a disturbance for the locals and will struggle to receive approvals, and the development might be extremely slowed down because of it, independently of the actual viability of the vehicles.

**3. A more pragmatic approach**

Personally, I think EHang’s strategy of starting with a simpler, two-seater, autonomous vehicle has paid off quite well. It allowed them to achieve certification and commercialization far earlier. A key point for me is that their platform was designed to be autonomous from day one, which I believe is the ultimate endgame for this industry in terms of operational efficiency and scalability. It also gives credibility to their ambitions when it comes to longer range vehicles. 

Their VT-35 will be able to fly 300km, and is already well into its certification process with the CAAC. They have a partnership with the city of Hefei to establish a comprehensive product hub for the VT-35, involving a joint investment of approximately 1 billion RMB, covering R&D, testing, manufacturing, and the entire certification process, significantly accelerating the model's industrialization.

They're also making variants of their EH216 model for other applications such as logistics and firefighting. 

**4. Tangible growth and expansion**

It's also clear that EHang's ambitions are not confined to its domestic market. Over the past year, they've solidified partnerships in the UAE, Southeast Asia, and parts of Europe, moving from demonstration flights to laying the groundwork for international sales and operations. This suggests a clear and aggressive growth strategy.

**5. The massive valuation disconnect**

EHang's market cap is hovering around $1 billion. Compare that to Archer at ~$5.5 billion and Joby at ~$11.5 billion.

To me, there is a massive valuation gap. It looks to me like the market is pricing Joby and Archer for near-perfect future execution, while seemingly discounting EHang's very real, present-day achievements. It makes the risk/reward much more attractive ofr EH.

**Conclusion: A safer bet on a very speculative sector**

As I see it, investing in Joby and Archer rely on a lot of uncertain event to go rights, starting from the certification, to the viability of the mass production, whether the piloted model can be viable or not (it's not an uber, you won't get away with paying pilots peanuts, so this makes the commercial viability more challenging as costs will be higher), the need to manage the roadblocks to the required infrastructure development, NIMBY blocking flight routes, safety concerns of the customers, etc. EVTOLs might succeed, but it's definitely a tough road ahead.

With EHang, I feel like you're investing in a company that has already proven its model. They have a certified product, established manufacturing, growing revenue, and a supportive domestic market. When factoring in that you're getting all this for a fraction of its competitors market caps, I find it hard to justify picking them over EH at the moment.

To be honest, I'm sure a lot of people will react with the usual ""China is uninvestable"" discourse, but I feel like it makes very little sense in this case, as the usual risks associated with Chinese stocks are very minor compared to the huge risk that such speculative investments represent in the first place. Even if you want to discount the stock a bit for it, it should at least be in the conversation when discussing EVTOLs companies.

1ncin8g,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 09:16:15,(09/9) Interesting Stocks Today - The Real Winner of Succession is...,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Murdoch’s $3.3 Billion Succession Deal Hands Lachlan Control](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-08/murdoch-family-settles-suit-over-trust-puts-lachlan-in-charge?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**NBIS (Nebius)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NBIS&p=d)\- Nebius said it signed a multibillion‑dollar agreement to provide Microsoft with artificial intelligence infrastructure. Ultimately spiked up to $110 yesterday and made a MASSIVE move afterhours, I'm primarily interested in seeing if we can continue that today. Watching $100 level. The Neocloud providers like Nebius (and CoreWeave) are benefiting from AI compute demand, and big tech is signaling that the AI party is continuing for now, overall a bullish sign for compute companies.

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d) **/** [**FIGR (Figure)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FIGR&p=d)\- FIGR IPO has been upsized, so CRCL has reacted positively to the news, I'm currently watching both leading up to the IPO of FIGR. Does this have as much potential as CRCL? I'd say no, but I think that it is an interesting watch. The surge of crypto‑industry IPOs sparked by Circle’s $1.05 B listing has been part of the IPO market coming back. FIGR is aiming for an IPO that is half its size, and is decently profitable. Planning to write a DD on this. Main risk in this is that we get absolutely euphoric (we're already very euphoric in the IPO market lol).

[**FOX (Fox Corp)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FOX&p=d)\- Lachlan Murdoch has won the game of Succession and the stock has drifted somewhat lower on this news-but it was done on such little volume we’ll have to wait until the market opens to see if FOX will stay down 5%.

[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)\- Day 2 of being added (or at least, notifying everyone it will be added) to the S&P 500! primarily interested in if it can continue the momentum and break ATH (\~$117/\~117.70).

1ncf2fd,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 06:19:34,"Share that one stock that everybody seems to hate, but you like","To me, it is $SNAP

Everybody is saying the same things about it. The CEO sucks, they have flopped many products, they can't monetize in the way that other social media giants can. But the reason I believe it's a good purchase: It’s survived wave after wave of “this app is dead” & still the userbase is growing year after year.

Snapchat is growing year-over-year, with a 7% increase in global monthly active users (MAU) to 932 million and a 9% increase in daily active users (DAU) to 469 million in Q2 2025.

This makes it very interesting for acquisitions by e.g. Meta or Google - or simply a complete overhaul of the monetization done by money hungry consultancy firms such as Mckinsey or Deloitte.

Besides, they currently already have increased profit quarter after quarter. They could even keep improving with the current set-up.

And the cherry on top: it's currently trading at an all time low.

It has the potential to grow slowly in the current states, but it could also increase exponentially with exciting developments in the future.

Should you allocate 50% of your portfolio? No. But a small position can't hurt, in my opinion.

1ncdql0,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 04:54:59,Thoughts on SpaceX's acquisition of Echostar,"In the realm of satellite communications, the most critical and scarce resource is frequency; orbital resources, by contrast, are abundant.

Among the foreign D2C satellite constellations, the only one that can truly compete with Starlink is ASTS, which is backed by numerous telecommunications operators. The others are merely dabbling.

ASTS has three relative advantages.

First, it has a large number of partner operators. Once its satellite network is complete, its services can be rolled out faster and more broadly.

Second, it has more frequency resources. Currently, most mobile communication frequencies are held by operators. With more partners, ASTS clearly has an advantage in this area. On a lighter note, ASTS once tested on a frequency band partially allocated to amateur radio enthusiasts, which drew protests from the amateur community. ASTS claimed their tests proved there would be no negative impact on others, but the FCC didn't buy their story and swiftly issued a clear order prohibiting ASTS from using that band.

Third, its satellites are more advanced, boasting the world's largest satellite communications array (223 square meters).

However, Starlink has now aggressively secured the AWS-4 and PCS H-Block frequency bands with its financial power, significantly diminishing ASTS's frequency advantage.

On the other hand, ASTS is facing delays in its network deployment. Only five BlueBird-1 satellites (the first generation, with a 64-square-meter array) are currently in operation. The manufacturing and launch progress of BlueBird-2 is far behind schedule. In contrast, Starlink has already deployed over 600 of its first-generation D2C satellites and has launched D2C data services via an app on select phones. Its next-generation D2C satellites are rumored to have thousands of directional beams, increasing communication capacity by 20-fold. ASTS's technological lead is shrinking, and the manufacturing and launch costs of BlueBird-2 are far higher than Starlink's. Even with a technical edge, it cannot compete with Starlink on a cost-performance basis.

Starlink's dominance in the D2C constellation market is becoming more solidified, and there is a possibility that operators who once backed ASTS could switch sides.

However, Starlink's D2C service still faces potential challenges.

Most existing mobile phones do not support the AWS-4 and PCS H-Block bands. To use these frequencies in the future, cooperation from handset manufacturers is required. Among these, Apple's stance is the most critical, and Apple has always had a poor relationship with SpaceX. Apple has been planning for D2C service for a long time, with its main satellite partner being Globalstar. It launched ""Emergency SOS via Satellite"" in 2022. However, Globalstar is still a traditional, old-school aerospace company, where delays and high costs are commonplace, and its network deployment is slow (a classic case of ""starting early but finishing late,"" which has become a traditional skill for Apple). When Starlink and T-Mobile launched their D2C service, Apple's response was not very enthusiastic. Although the iPhone series eventually enabled the service, its rollout was slower than that of Samsung and other phone manufacturers.

The future will depend on whether SpaceX and Apple can reconcile. If Apple remains stubborn and opposes SpaceX at the risk of losing money and alienating operators (a small but existing possibility), there isn't much SpaceX can do. As for the idea that SpaceX or Tesla would manufacture their own phones, it's best to take that with a grain of salt.

There is also speculation that SpaceX might enter the market directly and become a mobile communications operator itself. This scenario is also unlikely. SpaceX still holds too few frequency licenses. Becoming an operator involves a very cumbersome process of approvals and qualifications. Partnering with existing operators remains the best option.

Finally, while the D2C market is a ""blue ocean,"" how large is it really?

Starlink's terminal service has already been a great success because there is a huge market for broadband services in remote areas abroad. Capturing this market segment is enough to be profitable. At the same time, Starlink is also planning to compete in the fiber-to-the-home market. At the same technological level, satellite communication cannot compete with fiber optics in densely populated areas. But the reality is that competition is never based on an equivalent level of technology. The quality of home fiber service providers in Europe and America varies greatly, whereas Starlink is the leader among satellite service providers. It's like the saying: ""My average horse is weaker than yours, but my best horse is stronger than your mid-tier horse."" Therefore, SpaceX is actively preparing for Starlink V3 and the next-generation gigabit home terminal to compete with home fiber.

However, the D2C market may not be as large. The standard Starlink terminal service in the US costs about $100 per month. The monthly fee for D2C is only $10. Revenue from Starlink terminal users is expected to exceed $10 billion this year. If D2C service is priced at $10 per month, with operators taking half, reaching a similar revenue scale of $10 billion would require 160 million users. Achieving such a user base is very difficult.

The situation for mobile phones is different from that of fiber optics. No matter how poor the cell towers are, in densely populated areas, D2C can never compete with terrestrial base stations. Starlink terminals can compete with fiber by using large phased-array antennas and high-frequency, wide-bandwidth satellite communication bands. If the speed isn't enough, they can increase the terminal's array size and add more frequency bands. Mobile phones are limited by their size; the antenna's size and power cannot be increased significantly, and acquiring new frequency bands is an arduous battle for every 10 MHz due to operator monopolies.

D2C is a supplementary solution, meant to cover areas without cell tower signals. Elon Musk has also emphasized this in his speeches. If you disagree, you can argue with him on X. Some might say that technology will evolve and D2C will one day surpass base stations. But terrestrial base stations and ground networks are not standing still; they are also advancing. Furthermore, building a D2C satellite network is not cheap. Because phone antennas are small and their performance is limited, the satellites themselves must have higher performance (which is why ASTS is developing a 223-square-meter array), naturally leading to higher costs.

Therefore, D2C is a future development trend, and major operators, phone manufacturers, and satellite companies are all positioning themselves in this space. D2C constellations are emerging one after another, and a winner at the hundred-billion-dollar level might appear. However, the market size is ultimately limited.

1nbwetv,2025-09-08,2025-09-08 14:54:56,Respectfully: Why on earth should I invest *long term* (10+ yrs) into a MAG7?,"So - don't get me wrong: I believe you likely will not lose any money in the long run. You'll even make quite a lot. But what I am asking myself:


I read a lot about people who spend all their money on Google or Nvidia for the money to have doubled in 10 years. Sounds good - but 10 years is REALLY long and it has a risk of failure that the company gets into trouble and the stock goes sideways instead of up.
Why should I invest into e.g. Nvidia in the *long term* meaning 10+ years? Yes, the stock can grow 10% in a short period of time, and maybe double or triple over the whole time, but why shouldn't I sell earlier and realize my winnings I already have? Then I can invest into something else that might grow a little more in a shorter time frame, and so on. This could create more wealth in a shorter time. And I don't mean WSB-like trading here. More like ""read news every day and look in my depot every week"".


I understand that this might be about safety when investing into single stocks (MAG7 will very unlikely vanish). But IF I want safety, why not use an ETF exclusively? Yes, this has less revenue, but: When I invest in the short term, worst case is that it dips first, goes sideways, and sooner or later goes up (hopefully) - it becomes an unwilling long-term hold. When I invest in the long term, worst case is that just when I need it, the stock did just plummet. I make myself dependent on THIS single company.


Do you understand what I mean? I cannot wrap my head around this really. And what explicitly makes me think is that I am currently +20% with Google and think about cashing out. On the other hand, I think Google could still grow quite a lot within a shorter time frame (2-3 years).",0,88,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbwetv/respectfully_why_on_earth_should_i_invest_long/,new,Advice Request,0.39

> Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that he is “confident” that President Donald Trump’s tariff plan “will win” at the Supreme Court, but warned his agency would be forced to issue massive refunds if the high court rules against it.
> 
> If the tariffs are struck down, he said, “we would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the Treasury,” according to an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
> 
> He added, however, that “if the court says it, we’d have to do it.”
> 
> The Trump administration last week asked the Supreme Court for an “expedited ruling” to overturn an appeals court decision that found most of his tariffs on imports from other countries are illegal.
> 
> Generally, the Supreme Court could take as long as early next summer to issue a decision on the legality of Trump’s tariffs.
> 
> Bessent has said that “delaying a ruling until June 2026 could result in a scenario in which $750 billion-$1 trillion in tariffs have already been collected, and unwinding them could cause significant disruption.”
> 
> The prospect of the government having to refund tariffs of that magnitude could mean an unprecedented windfall to the businesses and entities that paid them.

Not sure how likely this is with SCOTUS but the last time Bessent ""warned"" what would happen if their tariffs were voided they lost in the appeals court decision. 

So this could be another signal that they aren't confident in the legality of about half of these tariffs implemented so far (regardless of him saying he's confident)

I'm curious about what companies will be the biggest winners if they are forced to give tariff refunds. I believe the Section 232 tariffs implemented so far will stay in effect, since the appeals court ruling covers tariffs under IEEPA. So this would mainly impact the retaliatory tariffs levied against every country",1492,215,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbq5q9/treasury_secretary_bessent_warns_of_massive/,new,Broad market news,0.98

Although still early stage, Archer’s push into electric vertical takeoff and landing technology is planting the seeds for a fundamentally new way to navigate urban airspace. The kind of energy around Archer isn't coming from hype, it's rooted in real momentum, industrial innovation backed by big-name partners, solid funding, and a clear path toward commercialization

The fact that someone is calling it a “no-brainer” reflects growing recognition that Archer’s mission to elevate mobility isn't some distant fantasy, it’s steadily becoming reality

Between ambitious certification timelines, manufacturing ramp-ups, and smart investments across the commercial and defense side of aviation, Archer is building a narrative that feels increasingly credible and compelling. 
It’s not just about flying taxis, it’s the transformation of urban and regional travel. That feels worth paying attention to, and keeping a positive lens on as we ride this story forward

If you recall, PPTA is on the verge of getting their final permits signed off. As well as gold, the property holds enough Antimony to supply up to 37% of the USA's requirements. America does not produce any Antimony, and it is *critical* for national defense munitions manufacture. No military bullets can be made without antimony. China has banned its export to the USA, and no, it is not a rare earth metal and so that ban has not been lifted. The antimony will get the mine built, the gold will make the money. The Company in a web presentation has stated that it will sell antimony concentrate created during the gold production to offset that production, making it the lowest cost gold producer in the USA, as well as the largest privately owned gold mine. All finances are in place for getting this started up (500M recently raised), and there is a 2B ExIm loan in the works already.

They only have one real permit left to get (I'm pretty sure, if not it is a dubious second). And that one permit has it's public comment period by the Idaho DEQ ending on Sept 8 (this Monday). After that there is some time to address the comments. I'm not sure of the timing but somewhere soon it goes into a draft permit if there are no significant issues. Given the federal permits take years to address, I'm thinking it's close (EDIT: i.e. all the big questions have been resolved with the federal permits and the state permits are much quicker to resolve). The company in one of their recent updates think it should be any time now. They have already stated that they are ready to present the go forward plan to shareholders anytime the permit(s?) complete which they expected in the summer. Likely production/refining by 2029.

**Look for this from June on YouTube (this sub doesn't allow YouTube links): ""Webinar: Perpetua Resources Unlocking the Stibnite Gold Project"".** It's the best overview out there. Also there are monthly updates on their site. Their projected share price in that was based on gold being $3000/oz is $38/share and $50/share at $3500/oz. If you've noticed, gold is climbing above 3600 and likely to go higher. Some speculate that gold will reach 5K in the next few years. And this is based on the current reserves they are about to open. But in fact there is high likelihood that there is nearly double that on their property, based on past exploratory drilling.

The only pain point is the the Nez Pierce tribe filing constant lawsuits. However I don't think any have stuck so far and they seem to be along the same vein. They're trying another one now but I think the counter argument to sink it is, why did you wait till now, this just seems like some blocking/delaying action. And many of their members want the mine for the jobs. They are trying to cause pain to block it, but simply put the mine is too important to the USA not to go forward.

More importantly is the fact that the mine is of significant strategic interest to the United States. Critical strategic interest in fact. Personally I think it is a done deal. It was on Biden's list to get built, Trump's top ten list, the DoD funded much of the permitting work, etc. That's my $0.02. As one should always do, do your own homework. :) Cheers.",19,3,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbc2vz/perpetua_resources_is_being_added_to_the_sptsx_as/,new,Company News,0.8

The Dutch ASML is committing 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) for Mistral’s 1.7 billion euro (\~$2 billion) fundraise and is expected to get a board seat at Mistral, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private negotiations.

The round will make Mistral the most valuable AI company in Europe with a 10-billion-euro ($11.7 billion) pre-money valuation in its latest Series C funding round, the people said.

ASML declined to comment. Mistral did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

1nazqw0,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 13:47:46,"The Weak Payroll Report Of Only 22,000 jobs Is Bad For The Market And The Economy","**S&P 500 recovery on 09/5/225:** I believe that the S&P 500's recovery from the day’s low to close just 0.2% down, after a weak payrolls report of 22,000 only net new jobs in August is a perverse reaction anticipating lower interest rates, and is incorrect. 

**Bad news is bad news:** Yes, the 10 year rallied from 4.17% to close at 4.08%, boosting the S&P 500 from the day's low, but weak jobs report confirms a 4 month trend of a softening labor market, it's not a flash in a pan. Further, I don’t see any catalysts for this trend reversing. The average four month payroll growth is now just 25,000, as compared to 185,000 in the same period last year, and 186,000 in 2024. And excluding the pandemic, this is the weakest monthly job creation since 2010. 

**A reliable job sector is showing weakness:** Worse, job creation in non cyclical sectors such as elder care, healthcare, government and municipal services has slowed signifying real barriers to employment growth. Healthcare jobs have always been the growth engine and a reliable one in an aging population, thus the slowdown in this sector is foreboding. Employment in health care and social assistance rose by about 47,000 in August. That’s the smallest monthly increase since January 2022. It’s arguably a big warning sign for the wider labor market given the sector has accounted for more than 40% of all new jobs over the last three years. 

**Non-Farm payrolls was not the only sign** – The JOLTS report showed slowdowns in job openings, unemployment claims have gone up and continuing claims remain high indicating that its getting tougher to find jobs.

**What can the rate cuts do and not do?**

It helps lower the 10-year treasury yield as we saw on Friday, which in turn will reduce mortgage rates and commercial business rates.

It will help housing the most, and ease financial conditions for commercial construction and business, but this will take time to filter through.

It does not directly help job creation

It will inflate assets, especially stocks, which is dangerous.

**Avoid the FOMO and BTD impulses:** Don’t jump in because the Fed will cut in September – that’s already priced in. The Fed will cut rates of at least 25 basis points, possibly 50 at the September 17 meeting, but cuts will take time to impact growth. **What’s not priced in is a weakening economy and a much needed correction in an expensive market.** Don’t chase the rally just on lower interest rates, instead understand that a weak labor market can nudge the country into a recession. To be sure, there has never been a recession with unemployment rates below 6%, and at 4.4% there are no alarm bells, but we’re trudging in the wrong direction. Trade policy uncertainties, AI productivity improvements and DOGE cuts are taking their toll on the economy. Rate cuts may briefly lift valuations,  but you need fundamental improvements to sustain the rally.

1napdma,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 06:02:37,OPEN Reality Check: From Someone Who Actually Built the Products You're Betting On,"*TL;DR:* While I'm rooting for OPEN long-term, the current price will correct down significantly. If you have profits, seriously consider taking some. This is deep in casino mode now - be warned.

Former OPEN leader here. More importantly, I’ve diamond-handed OPEN stock for years. I rode $OPEN up, then all the way down to 50¢. If you've only been holding for weeks, listen up. (*Update*: If my background is a distraction, ignore - most of my points below are public information anyway)

I also spent years protecting regular people from financial predators. The pump-and-dump energy around OPEN right now feels very familiar.

Over the weekend I talked to a few folks ready to jump in without realizing this is pure casino mode -  that’s what pushed me to write this up. If you already know OPEN is pure casino now, no need to keep reading - you likely know the rest already or do not care.

# Where We Are: Phenomenal Momentum, Terrible Risk/Reward

The $OPEN chart might as well have 🚀 on it. Golden Cross, record volume, RSI overbought - every meme signal is flashing. So we got a whopping 10x move from 50¢ in June to $6+ now.

But here’s the problem: options even with the new peak today give you less than 20% odds of hitting $12 in the next few months. 

Translation: you might roll a 6 and 2x, but odds are higher you get smacked with a 40–50% downdraft. 

This rally is priced to flame out in weeks, not years. Think before you YOLO because your buddy doubled last week.

# What Insiders Are Actually Doing

Forget charts. Look at the people with the most information.

* **Carrie** (former CEO)**:** As soon as she was **free** to sell after leaving, she unloaded \~$35M at $5/share. Usually that’s all you need to know.
* **Shrisha** (interim CEO): Yes, bought 30k shares - first insider buy I remember. Props, but symbolic. He already had a [4,250,000](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000180116925000078/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1756411509.xml) share grant, and his cash comp just jumped by [another $500k-$1M](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000114036125033195/ef20054807_8ka.htm). A 30k buy is <1% of his stake and covered by his raise. To be clear, I'm rooting for him and have been very impressed by his leadership, but that buy isn't something you should make big bets on.
* **Veterans:** Every insider free to sell I've talked to has sold everything (except one). That includes 10-year veterans who have seen it all. And more telling: no one is buying.

Sure, insiders sell for all kinds of reasons. But here’s the pattern: nobody was buying at $2 - and they sure aren’t buying at $6–7. that tells you everything.

# Why the Bull Arguments Don't Hold Water

I hear the bull cases - “I will wait for Fed cuts / new CEO / earnings.” Here’s why they don’t stack up:

* **Rates: Already Baked In** The stock trades higher now than when rates were close to zero and Opendoor was doing 5x the revenue. A predictable 25 bps cut in two weeks? Classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” (look it up) - the price might actually drop. 
* **Q3 Earnings Will Be Brutal:** Don't take my word for it. Opendoor's own [guidance](https://www.opendoor.com/articles/2025-second-quarter-financial-results) shows revenue dropping 50% from Q2's $1.57B to just $800-875M in Q3. They also forecast returning to losses: adjusted EBITDA loss of $21-28M after barely eking out a $23M profit in Q2. How do you think retail buyers will react when earnings show a 50% revenue drop?
* **New CEO Won't Be Magic:** Short of hiring Elon Musk, no new CEO can justify a 5x-10x price jump alone. The business model challenges remain the same regardless of who's in charge. Leadership takes time. This market won’t wait.

# Bottom Line

I'm not saying OPEN is worthless or to trash the company. I genuinely want the company, and the years of work by some of the most talented people I have known, to be lasting. The Q2 2025 positive EBITDA of $23M was a monumental achievement after years of losses.

But this 1000% rally has priced in years of perfect execution. You're betting everything goes right - housing recovers, margins improve, debt becomes manageable.

Even if the next two weeks are great, the next few months will likely be ugly. Q3 earnings will show that 50% revenue drop. The new CEO search will take time. Rate cuts won't magically fix the business model. And when reality hits, this thing will fall fast.

**If you have profits:** Take some off the table. Insiders sold at well below $5, you're sitting at $6-7.

**If you believe long-term:** Wait for a better entry point. This isn't your last chance.

**If you're speculating:** Set stops and don't risk money you can't lose.

I know I'll get hate from true believers (whom I respect) and from pumpers looking for exit liquidity. That's fine. Call me a pessimist or worse - that's better than watching ordinary people get wrecked.

Some argue this could provide a strong floor for equities since there’s so much “dry powder” ready to buy the dip. Others point out that investors often hesitate to deploy cash during sharp selloffs, waiting until markets have already recovered before stepping in.

Do you think this cash hoard will actually help stabilize the market during downturns, or is it more likely to sit on the sidelines until after the damage is done?

> Nestle has fired its chief executive after just one year in the job because he failed to disclose a ""romantic relationship"" with a ""direct subordinate"". The Swiss food giant, which makes Kit Kat chocolate bars and Nespresso coffee capsules, said Laurent Freixe had been dismissed with ""immediate effect"" following an investigation led by Nestle's chair and lead independent director. The BBC understands the inquiry was triggered by a report made through the company's whistleblowing channel. Nestle chair Paul Bulcke said: ""This was a necessary decision. Nestle's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestle.""

> The relationship was with an employee who is not on the executive board and the investigation began because it represented a conflict of interest, the BBC has learned. As well as Mr Bulcke, independent director Pablo Isla oversaw the inquiry into Mr Freixe ""with the support of independent outside counsel"". The Financial Times has reported that concerns were raised about Mr Freixe's relationship with an employee earlier this year and, after an internal investigation, the claims were found to be unsubstantiated. After the complaints persisted, the newspaper reports that Nestle conducted another investigation with help from outside counsel after which the claims were upheld.

1n9jpac,2025-09-05,2025-09-05 18:57:15,"Kinsale Capital Group ($KNSL) - Expensive on the surface, a long term high quality growth opportunity underneath","Disclaimer: I currently own a small tracker position <1% of my portfolio. Looking to increase to a 15-20% position over the coming months to year.

Kinsale Capital ($KNSL) is a lesser known name in the property and casualty (P&C) insurance space. Formed in 2009 by founder and CEO Michael Kehoe (see speech from him on YT talking on Baron conference) with others from James River, the company went public in 2016 and has since delivered a ~22X return for investors since IPO. I believe this company has much more room for growth, and the recent multiple compression occurring over the last 2 years due to no significant share price movement offers a good entry point for new long term investors.

Kinsale Capital is the only publicly traded pure play excess and surplus (E&S) insurer of P&C. Basically for those that don't follow the insurance industry, this is a ""niche"" insurance market for risk that the standard market cannot bear, underwrite or price. This market has a total adressable value of >115B. It's for policies that carry too much risk or are so unconventional that no standard insurer (i.e. Progressive, Libery Mutual, GEICO...) in the admitted market will accept it. Think risky buisnesses like a night club in a rough part of town, a weapons manufacturer, a demolitions company, or a business that has already made multiple claims in the past. Where standard insurers turn away from this risk, Kinsale steps in. The E&S market is not limited by regulations and policies as compared to the standard market, and Kinsale is allowed to thereby create its own prices to fully adjust for the risk it bears and add significant exclusions to its policies to limit risk.

Anywho, Kehoe discusses the business quite well in his speech from the Baron conference, so you can get a more detailed idea by watching the video.

Sounds great? What's the catch?

The company has historically traded at a significant premium valuation for an insurance/financial business, which I believe is why the stock has been relatively stagnant since October 2023. It has had two short thesis written on it on VIC and have heard of other shorts explaining their thesis on YouTube. Shorts have thus far not succeeded in their plays. Its 5 year average trailing PE has hovered around 38, and forward PE of 34. It has also carried a significant price to book premium of 7-8x, as compared to most insurance carriers at 1-2x.

Since October 2023 with no significant movement in share price, the multiples have compressed as the buisness continues to grow. The trailing and fwd PE now hovers around 24, and price to book has contracted to a, still frothy, 6x.

My thesis lies in my conviction that this premium is well justified. Following Buffets timeless saying, own wonderful businesses at fair prices, as compared to fair businesses at wonderful prices.

There are several factors that stand out with Kinsale which I believe justify it's high valuation. The company is growing significantly faster than most insurance carriers. Net income and underwriting income y/y continues to grow at rates from 25-45%. The ROE sits comfortably around 30%. The company also has a combined ratio, the primary metric used by insurance carriers to show profitability after accounting for claims payouts and business expenses, of astounding percentages in the mid-70s. As of the most recent quarter, 75.8% - this is practically unheard of in the insurance business. Most insurers average in the low to mid 90s (lower is better, indicating more profitability. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit while combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss).

The company operates a lean, low cost business model and only has about 700 full time employees. Kehoe has stated that they are very disciplined in their underwriting and carry conservative loss reserves. The E&S space continues to also grow annually in the low teens, roughly double that of the standard P&C space in the mid single digits. Kehoe further describes a business quality that other insurers don't have is a contemporary and centralized software to process claims quickly, where other insurers who rely on M&A must compile data across many legacy platforms that decrease efficiency and time to process claims. Kehoe also has a large shareholder incentive as the majority of his wealth is tied to Kinsale, as Chris Mayer says, skin in the game - Kehoe owns about 3.8% of the company. Finally, the company appears to have significant room for growth, as they only hold about 1.4% of the TAM of E&S policies based on their financial presentation.

While I don't think Kinsale is a screaming buy, I believe this is a good entry point for a long term position that will continue to show positive and upward momentum in the next 5-10 years.

Risks:

- Continues to carry a premium valuation despite recent years multiple compression, still holds P/B of 6x, well above industry peers

- Recent decline in growth of their largest line, commercial property, though all other lines continue to grow at ~15%

- Operates in a risky and litigious insurance space, battles with many litigations over claims

I honestly don’t understand why some people think that stimulating the economy alone will make companies hire workers.

Or rather, they think the Fed can’t tell what’s causing the slowdown in jobs and will eventually cut rates mindlessly.

Look at the manufacturing sector, the biggest victim of tariffs. Not only have tariffs failed to help them recover, but high raw material prices have also destroyed their competitiveness. Is this something that cutting interest rates can fix? Sigh.

1n9dojz,2025-09-05,2025-09-05 14:52:50,Elon Musk New Pay Package is the Inverse of what is institutional knowledge,"They just released his new 1 trillon dollar pay package that in order to hit would require certain targets. This is the only time that I've seen so many inverse things happen like this.

* Giving a founder additional shares to do his job just to motivate him when the majority of his wealth is based on Tesla in the first place, Refreshers are normal and option plans are normal, but needing 1T worth of them is not.
* They think that old Elon who used to captivate an audience through being progressive and promoting the future... will somehow return (not only has he lost steam for promising lofty ideas but people are finally tired of broken promises by him, every year its another almost there target for self driving. Also where is the new roadster?)
* Everyone is tired of Elon standing on stage trying to compute how to speak  as he jumps around and does salutes ""as a joke""  vs someone who sits back and builds out the company to its full potential
* The company still caters to a a high end, well educated consumer for their products. As soon as he lost the base for it he did all the damage control he could. He literally tried to have Trump sell his cars on the Whitehouse green, that's how desperate its got for him crying on twitch (a gaming platform) about people hating him.
* The board of directors is  stacked in his favor but also is so fearful of him that they won't standup to him. They at least have enough of a spine to make sure he hits targets to get his package. Although he will never meet those goals so I guess if you are an Elon Supporter this is great news (your lord is staying around) if you are inbetween you know what you are getting and if you hate him, well he has a giant carrot Infront of him to do something.

I think that the pay package is so strange as somehow he will recover the mess he created. If I joined a company (as Elon joined Tesla, he didn't create it) then got it to the position where he risked everything to make it the brand/success it is, then tanked it by his political/ketamine rants, then was offered 1T to act normal and bring it all back.... I'd be the luckiest person on earth. This story is bonkers.

**I'd rather see they pay someone a 1 trillion dollar pay package to wipe Elon's image out of the Tesla picture or** associated with Elon. A rebrand to being progressive, for human rights, and a environmental company .

This is the strangest pay package I've ever seen. The bottom line is, if they hired any reputable CEO that can re-establish the brand of being a modern, progressive company, they would be back on track, not trying to force this monstrosity back into its cage with money.

Tesla in Europe, China, and even North America sales are steadily declining, tax credit offsets are ending, the company needs a new face, and Elon is the worst way to promote what was once the progressive movement.

EDIT:  
To everyone saying that if they don't offer this up he'll leave and either start another competitor or destroy the brand. The issue is the brand is destroyed already by someone who tweets about illegal aliens and governement conspiracies all day and night. How has his ventures gone since he became the DOGE psychopath? XAi is a dumster fire of VC money, Boring Company has.... built a tunnel under vegas convention center that has human drivers for robo taxi's, sales have steadily declined, solar and battery have been taken over by other companies, uhhh what am I missing?

AI depends on data. This data will need to be stored somewhere. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) do most of the storing of world's data currently. SSDs (solid state/flash) carry the rest of the data.

Will AI need more HDD or SSD ? Or both and hence demand for both will go up ?

There are only few (like 3/4 ?) manufacturers of storage. STX, WD, Toshiba being the major ones. While their recent quarter revenues haven't yet shown any large demand related to AI and revenues haven't shown increase like that in NVDA revenue, wouldn't in the future they will have more AI driven demand ? like multiple times of current demand ?

If yes, how come these stocks are down ? recent revenues were down but isn't that like ignoring the potential demand from AI requirements ?

Or will AI become smart enough (learn using existing data) to require not much additional storage and thus there won't be much demand growth due to AI for storage?

Alphabet Inc.’s Google was fined almost €3 billion ($3.5 billion) by the European Union and ordered to stop favoring its own advertising technology services, in a move that risks further inflaming tensions with US President Donald Trump.
The European Commission said Friday that Google had abused its dominance by giving its own ad exchanges a competitive advantage over rivals and that it must bring the practices to an end.

“When markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power,” EU antitrust commissioner Teresa Ribera said in a statement. “True freedom means a level playing field, where everyone competes on equal terms and citizens have a genuine right to choose.”

The company immediately vowed to appeal. Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice president for regulatory affairs at Google, said the move “imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money.”

The EU punishment comes at a tense moment for EU–US trade relations, with Trump repeatedly deriding the bloc’s efforts to rein in Silicon Valley giants. Although Google faces antitrust scrutiny worldwide, it won some relief this week when a US judge ruled that its search business would not need to be broken up to address the harms alleged by the Department of Justice.

Google’s adtech operations, however, also remain under threat in the US. The DOJ is expected to file proposed remedies later on Friday, ahead of a Sept. 22 hearing on those proposals. Previously, the department had floated forcing Google to divest its Ad Manager platform to tackle the alleged anticompetitive risks.

The EU warned Google in 2023 that it had abused its dominance in advertising technology to harm online publishers. At the time, the Brussels-based commission said Google had favored its own ad exchange program over its rivals and bolstered the company’s central role in the ad tech supply chain.
Ribera’s predecessor Margrethe Vestager warned then that only a “mandatory divestment” of part of its business would solve the issues. The Dane had spent a decade in Brussels, where she hit Google with fines of more than €8 billion across three different cases, although one penalty was annulled and another cut by EU judges.",707,216,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n98aaa/google_fined_almost_3_billion_by_eu_for_abusing/,new,Company News,0.95

You may remember me from such classics as “$LULU - the bar is low” where I mentioned that I had a $1 million investment in Lulu stock at $205.

I went through the numbers and listened in on the call, and while I feel there is some turbulence ahead, I feel that it’s not all doom and gloom.

1) Tariffs have hurt, but the de minimis exemption removal was particularly painful. Increasing prices in a softening macro isn’t the way to do it, but price increases will come as rate cuts boost the economy. There is also a wild card out here: the Supreme Court may rule the tariffs illegal and order all tariffs collected to be refunded. Lutnick’s own ex-firm, which is being run by his sons, is reportedly betting on this outcome.

2) Management has had their “come to Jesus” moment. Calvin has done well and presided over massive growth, but I think they got a little too cocky. No doubt he is feeling the pressure over the 67% stock slump, and they will shake things up now and go back to what made them great to begin with. More product innovation, more technical apparel, and more frequent refreshes. They can’t just introduce a slightly different color for a model of leggings and call it a day. 

3) An activist could get involved, which could likely be Chip Wilson, the founder and a major shareholder. Chip built this company from scratch and has an uncanny sense of what the consumer wants. The last time Lulu slipped up (2018) Chip tried to buy it out. He didn’t succeed, but the changes he demanded resulted in a 10x of the stock.

4) The stock has never been this cheap; it’s at a low teens PE. Yes, the E may fall a bit more, but Lulu has $1.2 billion in cash and they’ve been actively buying back shares. If they reduce capex (they should, no need to grow store count during this time) they can direct free cash to buying up cheap shares and increasing EPS metrics.

5) Their main competitor, Alo, is not public yet. They’re spending balls-to-the-wall on influencers in order to goose their revenue so they get a higher multiple for their IPO. However, Alo has much higher CAQ and lower customer retention than Lulu, so it’s not sustainable.

By the way, before anyone declares them dead, they will have $11 BILLION in sales this year and they are very profitable.

1n92hmm,2025-09-05,2025-09-05 07:18:21,ACHR Discussion: Can eVTOLs Ever Be Profitable?,"Greetings,

Archer Aviation (ACHR) has been on my radar as one of the more ambitious names in the emerging eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) space. With the stock now trading under $10, it’s worth taking a closer look from a value perspective.

**The Bear Case: Heavy Cash Burn and Dilution**

**Massive Cash Burn:** Archer is losing ~$500M in free cash flow annually. Scaling aircraft manufacturing is extremely capital intensive & it may be years before the company can generate positive cash flow

**Dilution Risk:** Shares outstanding are up more than 50% YoY as the company raised $850M last quarter. This shareholder dilution could continue as Archer funds its manufacturing buildout.

**Execution Risk:** To cover its expenses, Archer would need to deliver 300+ Midnight aircraft annually, far above the 50 planned in the near term. Any delays in certification or ramp up could extend losses and erode investor confidence.


**The Bull Case: Strategic Backers and Market Potential**

**Strong Investors:** Boeing, United Airlines, Stellantis, and ARK Invest are all backing Archer. This validation from major aviation players gives credibility to its long-term vision.

**Cash Runway:** With $1.7B on the balance sheet, Archer has several years of runway to prove itself, even at the current burn rate.

**Commercial Opportunities:** Initial deliveries to Abu Dhabi Aviation, plans for taxi routes at the LA 2028 Olympics, and potential defense contracts with Anduril offer multiple paths to revenue.

**Urban Mobility Moat:** If eVTOL becomes mainstream, Archer could benefit from first-mover advantage in building networks in cities where time savings (10min flights vs. hour long drives) have clear value

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/time-to-buy-the-dip-on-archer-aviation-stock-below-10/ar-AA1LR8n0?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds

**My Take:**
At under $10, Archer offers exposure to a potentially transformative technology but comes with serious risks. The high burn rate and reliance on capital raises make it vulnerable, yet the backing of large industry players and its international traction provide a real (though speculative) upside case

For me, this falls into the optionality bucket it could be a multi bagger if execution goes right or a value trap if certification drags and dilution continues

**Questions for the community:**

-Do you believe Archer can realistically ramp from 50 aircraft per year to 300+ within a decade?

-How do you handicap the probability of FAA approval by 2028?

-Would you treat ACHR as a venture style bet/ does the dilution risk outweigh the upside?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

The company reported second-quarter net income of $370.9 million, or $3.10 per share, compared to $392.92 million, or $3.15 per share, in the year-ago period.

Same-store sales in the Americas were down 4%. Overall comparable sales increased just 1% compared to Wall Street estimates of 2.2%.

It projects third-quarter revenues will be between $2.47 billion and $2.50 billion compared to Wall Street estimates of $2.57 billion. The company said it expects earnings per share in the next quarter to be between $2.18 and $2.23 per share, compared to an estimate of $2.93 per share.

Highlights:

Meanwhile, the market is underappreciating the rising quality of Google’s ad leads, which will cause pricing to go up, providing another tailwind for the stock.

Mahaney’s current price target for the stock sits at $240 per share, implying an upside of 13%. But he believes shares could eventually rise to around the $300 level, which is approximately 42% than where shares are currently trading.

Mahaney added that this ruling is also a “big win” for Apple.

“This has clearly been an overhang on Apple stock, and now they’ve got this almost guaranteed $20, $25 billion a year, and super high margin revenue coming their way thanks to Google,” he said. Some stocks like MS, GS, AXP, BGM, RXRX are in my watchlist because I think these Google's move may have impacts on these AI stuff.

1n7q8at,2025-09-03,2025-09-03 16:36:50,Salesforce issues weak revenue guidance even as earnings beat estimates,"Salesforce issued disappointing guidance on Wednesday, even as earnings and revenue topped estimates for the fiscal second quarter. The stock dropped 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.91 adjusted vs. $2.78 expected
* **Revenue:** $10.24 billion vs. $10.14 billion expected

Revenue increased 10% from $9.33 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income rose to $1.89 billion, or $1.96 per share, from $1.43 billion, or $1.47 per share, a year ago.

For the fiscal third quarter, management called for $2.84 to $2.86 in adjusted earnings per share on $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had been looking for $2.85 per share on $10.29 billion in revenue.

Salesforce maintained its full-year revenue outlook but now sees higher earnings. The company is targeting $11.33 to $11.37 in adjusted earnings per share on $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion in revenue. The consensus estimate from LSEG was $11.31 in earnings per share and $41.2 billion in revenue. The forecast in May included $11.27 to  $11.33 in adjusted earnings per share.

Salesforce has fallen out of favor on Wall Street this year due to an extended stretch of meager revenue growth, which has been stuck in the single digits since mid-2024. While the company regularly touts its investments in artificial intelligence and the advancements in its software and systems, it hasn’t been lifted by the AI boom in the same way as many of its tech peers.

Going into Wednesday’s report, Salesforce was down 23% for the year, lagging behind all but one stock in the Dow and trailing all other large-cap tech companies.

The ratio of Salesforce’s enterprise value to its free cash flow has reached a 10-year low because of fears of disruption from AI, according to analysts at Jefferies, who have a buy rating on the stock. Salesforce is trying to counter the pressure by selling its Agentforce AI software that can automate the handling of customer service questions.

During the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce said it was planning to increase the cost of some products and announced its intent to acquire data management software company Informatica for $8 billion.

1n7q103,2025-09-03,2025-09-03 16:29:26,Figma’s stock plunges after company’s first earnings report since IPO,"Figma shares plunged 13% in extended trading on Wednesday after the design software company reported results for the first time since its IPO in July.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** breakeven
* **Revenue:** $249.6 million vs. $248.8 million expected

Revenue increased 41% year over year in the second quarter from a year earlier, Figma said in a statement. The company provided a preliminary estimate of $247 million to $250 million in a July regulatory filing. CNBC isn’t including a profit estimate because it’s Figma’s first earnings report.

Net income totaled $846,000, compared with a loss of $827.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. The company’s adjusted operating income came to $11.5 million, after Figma provided a prior estimate of $9 million to $12 million.

For the third quarter, Figma forecast revenue of between $263 million and $265 million, which would represent about 33% growth at the middle of the range. The LSEG consensus was $256.8 million.

The company sees between $88 million and $98 million in adjusted operating income for the full year and a little over $1.02 billion in revenue. The revenue range implies about 37% growth and is above the $1.01 billion LSEG consensus.

In the second quarter, Figma announced Figma Make, which uses artificial intelligence to compose app and website designs based on a user’s descriptions, and Figma Sites, which turns designs into working websites. The company also acquired vector graphics startup Modyfi and content management system startup Payload.

A number of software vendors have faced pressure this year due to concerns surrounding AI and whether it will displace business. Figma co-founder and CEO Dylan Field said he’s not seeing that play out internally and that, if anything, the role of designers will only become more critical.

“I think that the more that software becomes easier to build with AI, the more that people are going to see that that human touch is needed,” Field said. He acknowledged that Figma has been adopting so-called vibe-coding tools for AI-driven software development.

Figma reported a 129% net retention rate, a reflection of expansion with existing customers. The figure was down from 132% in the first quarter.

Following its IPO, Figma expects a share sale lockup to expire for 25% some employees’ stock after market close on Sept. 4. Investors holding just over half of Figma’s outstanding Class A stock have agreed to an extended lock-up that will expire in August 2026 for about 35% of their shares.

Field said he wanted to provide clarity for investors.

“That’s something that I think is valuable information,” he said.

On Wednesday the company’s stock closed at $68.13. The company priced shares in its IPO at $33, and saw the stock pop to $115.50 in its debut.

The company’s splashy, yet controversial, campaign with the “Euphoria” star led to some criticism and blowback but the launch, coupled with a recent partnership with Taylor Swift’s new fiancé Travis Kelce, has led to new customer acquisition and positive traffic across channels. 

American Eagle stock soared more than 20% in after-hours trading Wednesday.

“The fall season is off to a positive start. Fueled by stronger product offerings and the success of recent marketing campaigns with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce, we have seen an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales,” CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a news release. “We look forward to building on our progress and the continued strength of our iconic brands to drive higher profitability, long-term growth and shareholder value.” 

The company also re-issued its full-year guidance after withdrawing it earlier this year. It now expects comparable sales to be approximately flat, better than the 0.2% decline analysts had anticipated, according to StreetAccount. 

It still expects gross margin to be down for the duration of the year, but it made key changes to its outlook for operating income, which is bearing the brunt of the tariff impact. The company is now expecting its full-year operating income to be between $255 million and $265 million, down from a previous range of between $360 million and $375 million. 

Here’s how American Eagle performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 45 cents vs. 21 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $1.28 billion vs. $1.24 billion expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $77.6 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with $77.3 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales fell to $1.28 billion, down slightly from $1.29 billion a year earlier. 

For the current quarter, American Eagle is expecting comparable sales to be up in the low single digit range, better than the 0.9% uptick analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. It’s expecting the same trend during the fourth quarter.

> WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing contracted for a sixth straight month in August as factories dealt with the fallout from the Trump administration's import tariffs, with some manufacturers describing the current business environment as ""much worse than the Great Recession.""
> 
> The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Tuesday also showed some manufacturers complaining that the sweeping import duties were making it difficult to manufacture goods in the United States. President Donald Trump has defended his protectionist trade policy, which has raised the nation's average tariff rate to the highest in a century, as necessary to revive a long-declining U.S. industrial base.
> 
> That was reinforced by government data showing spending on the construction of factories dropped in July and was down 6.7% from a year ago. A U.S. appeals court ruled last Friday that most of Trump's tariffs were illegal, adding more uncertainty for businesses.
> 
> ""I continue to see the broad economy generally and the manufacturing sector in particular as in a holding pattern until tariff-related uncertainty recedes,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander U.S. Capital Markets.
> 
> The ISM said its manufacturing PMI edged up to 48.7 last month from 48.0 in July. A PMI reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for 10.2% of the economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PMI would rise to 49.0.
> 
> Seven industries, including textile mills, miscellaneous manufacturing and primary metals, reported growth last month. Among the 10 industries reporting contraction were makers of paper products, machinery, electrical equipment, appliances and components as well as computer and electronic products.
> 
> Tariffs continued to dominate commentary from manufacturers. Some makers of transportation equipment said conditions were worse than the 2007-09 recession, adding ""there is absolutely no activity"" and ""this is 100 percent attributable to current tariff policy and the uncertainty it has created."" Some viewed the conditions as consistent with ""stagflation.""

Webull (BULL) is currently trading around 13.2/share. It IPOd on 11Apr right at market lows. There was immediate interest sending the IPO price from $12 to $60, then a sell off to $11. 

Financials: 
Revenue Q1 = $117M
Revenue Q2 = $131.5M
Q3 projection = $150M 

Yes they have competition from other brokerages, but their market edge is lower trading fees and easy to use app. They now also permit other forms of trading which im not allowed to specify on this sub. 

So why webull? 

If you do a simple Revenue vs. Market cap comparison of brokerages, Webull is by far the most undervalued brokerage - likely because they recently had smaller market exposure pre-IPO and the IPO timing was horrible. 

Webull would be trading at $39/share using a revenue vs market cap vs. Share price comparison to other brokerages (aggregate). 

In other words, if Webulls financials were treated the same as other brokerages, it should simply be close to $40/share. 

$13/share is outrageously undervalued for this brokerage. Time and value will realize itself and Webull will be trading at $40/share soon. Just a matter of time.

Waller proceeded to lecture the audience that what people don't understand is ""see through inflation"".  He said people don't understand that this is just temporary and caused by tariffs and you need to see through it and it will soon go away.  I guess by magic,  he didn't say what would cause it to go away.

The department store operator also raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance. It now expects adjusted earnings of between $1.70 and $2.05 per share, compared with $1.60 to $2 per share, and revenue between $21.15 billion and $21.45 billion, compared with $21 billion to $21.4 billion.

The stock surged 20% in early trading on Wednesday.

Macy’s had slashed its full-year guidance last quarter and reported uncertainty in sales due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

“We’re just well positioned right now for the environment we’re in to take share, to deliver for our customers and to provide a better experience,” CEO Tony Spring told CNBC in an interview.

Last quarter, the company said it was hiking prices of certain products to offset tariff costs. Spring said Wednesday that the company now has tariff impacts included in its outlook and remains cautiously optimistic about the future.

“Tariffs are real. It’s a component of the business, but we have tail winds that we are trying to mitigate against those headwinds,” Spring said. “That’s a better customer experience, that’s a newer assortment, that’s less redundancy in our assortment, that’s now a business that’s growing across all three nameplates in our portfolio and a healthy inventory position going into the fall season.”

Spring added that the consumer remains resilient and continues to spend on new items and fashion.

Macy’s said it saw its best comparable sales growth in 12 quarters, and Spring said the retailer’s strategy is leaning into business segments that are working to keep its momentum going, including growth in denim, women’s contemporary apparel and watches.

Here’s how the company performed during its fiscal second quarter, compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 41 cents adjusted vs. 18 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $4.81 billion vs. $4.76 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Aug. 2, the company’s net income was $87 million, or 31 cents per share, compared with $150 million, or 53 cents per share, the year prior. Net sales dropped from $4.94 billion in the year-ago period to $4.81 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were 41 cents.

Macy’s said the group of 125 stores that the company has chosen to focus on with higher staffing and renovations, outperformed the broader Macy’s brand, seeing comparable sales growth of 1.1% on an owned basis.

The department store also owns Bloomingdale’s, which reported comparable sales growth of 3.6% on an owned basis, and Bluemercury, which saw comparable sales rise 1.2%. Those two brands have consistently performed better than the Macy’s namesake stores.

The company also reported a $28 million increase in credit card net revenue to $153 million.

“When you think about the strength of a department store or a marketplace, it’s when multiple categories are working,” Spring said Wednesday.

CFO Tom Edwards said on a call with analysts on Wednesday that Macy’s is exploring more price hikes on certain products because of tariffs.

“We’re adjusting prices, but as appropriate, not broad-based and really assessing it with our partners in an effort to remain competitive,” Edwards said. “I believe that we are really well positioned to navigate through this time given our business model.”

Merchants, such as Walmart, Amazon, and many more, love BNPL because people tend to purchase more items, as well as items they don't immediately need.  In fact, they're willing to pay 3% to 8% fee for BNPL operating companies to complete the purchase, which would be substantially more than the credit card fee of 2 to 3%.  On top of the merchants' fees, BNPL has strict late fees and a high interest rate for late payments.

The BNPL market reached $340 billion globally in 2024 and continues to grow year over year. In 2024, 86.5 million Americans used BNPL services across retail categories. Shoppers spent $18.2 billion using BNPL during the 2024 holiday season alone.  BNPL Payments to Grow by 13.7% to Surpass $560 billion this Year.

1n7ejyn,2025-09-03,2025-09-03 09:17:10,Markets are at record highs. Which growth stocks still have room in H2 2025? Here are 5 with surprising data,"The S&P and Nasdaq are sitting near record highs…but not every growth stock has run as hard as the mega-caps. Some names are showing double digit sales growth and EPS momentum while still trading below their 2021 peak valuations…

Here are a few that stood out to me (data from Finviz / company filings):

APP (Applovin): +36% YTD; EPS +102% this year; sales growth +34% YoY; forward P/E ~32.8

DASH (DoorDash): +47% YTD; EPS up ~750%; revenue +23.8% YoY; forward P/E ~63

CVNA (Carvana): +76% YTD; EPS growth +170%; sales +39.5% YoY; forward P/E ~117

NET (Cloudflare): +82% YTD; +138% 1-year return; forward P/E ~176.7

PINS (Pinterest): EPS +41%; profit margin ~49%; sales +17% YoY; forward P/E ~16.6

These are all strong movers, but the valuations range wildly…Some look like they still have room to run, while others may already be stretched…

Which of these growth names do you think can still outperform in H2?

Do high forward P/Es make them too risky at these levels, or are fundamentals strong enough to justify it?

Like some other retailers with low or no dividends they trade at very high PE multiples.  Their share prices have been bullet-proof, no doubt bolstered by the increasing average age of cars in the US.   But, take ORLY for example at a PE of 37 and market cap of $88 billion (bigger than either Ford or GM or Cummins).

Net income 2021 - 2024 up from $2.16 to $2.39 billion (only 10% increase).  CPI inflation is more than that (18.5% since Dec-2021).   This even when their store count is up by over 10% over the same period.  They are not growing like a tech company despite their 37 PE.

Long term debt up from $3.8  -  $5.5 billion (50% increase).

Their earnings per share have increased, as they buy back shares rather then pay dividends.  Though it seems like much of those purchases are funded by added debt.   That has worked out for them as their share price has gone from \~$50 then  to >$100 today, but I wonder if share buybacks at $100 will look so wise in the future.

Insider transactions seem to be tilted to selling ($9 million recently by a senior VP).

“We will begin driving manually before validating our technology and operations for fully autonomous services in the future,” a company spokesperson said in an email. Waymo announced the tests in blog posts.

The autonomous vehicle venture aims to expand its driverless, ride-hailing service across the U.S. after already launching commercial operations in Austin, Texas, as well as Atlanta, San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles.

In some markets, including Austin and Atlanta, Waymo’s driverless rides can only be hailed through the Uber app. In others, riders must use the company’s standalone Waymo One app to book a robotaxi.

Safety drivers, who are employees of Waymo, will man the steering and braking behind the test vehicles in Denver and Seattle. The company is also running similar tests with its robotaxis in New York, having recently obtained permits in the biggest U.S. market.

The company’s test fleet in Denver and in Seattle will include a mix of their fully electric Jaguar iPace and Geely Zeekr AVs.

Waymo told CNBC that it will have up to a dozen cars each in Denver and Seattle to start testing.

Waymo’s primary competition on the global stage is Baidu-owned Apollo Go in China, which operates driverless ride-hailing services throughout Asia. Meanwhile, Tesla has obtained a permit to operate a ride-hailing business in Texas, and is testing a manned robotaxi service in Austin and another in San Francisco.

Honestly, it feels like there are too many headwinds piling up at the same time, and no one can agree on which one is the real driver.

September is usually a bad month for stocks anyway, especially for tech. Maybe this is just the classic seasonal slump playing out. But it also feels like the other stuff going on is making it worse. A federal appeals court just ruled most of Trump’s tariffs were illegal, which doesn’t kill tariffs forever but does leave everything messy. Nobody knows what the new rules will look like, which goods are impacted, or if companies might even get refunds for what’s already been collected. That kind of limbo is exactly what markets hate.

Then there’s the government shutdown risk. Congress has until September 30 to figure it out, and the odds of a shutdown are being thrown around at 40 percent. If it happens, you could see cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which would ripple through the economy. Maybe they pass a short-term patch that drags this into December, but even the back-and-forth in DC is enough to make investors nervous.

The Fed adds another layer. Nobody’s sure what their next move is, and stocks entered September priced for perfection, so the bar is high. When valuations are stretched like this, even a little bit of bad news can knock things down. Add in the jobs report coming on Friday, and you’ve got another potential swing factor hanging over the week.

So yeah, between seasonality, tariffs, shutdown talk, and Fed uncertainty, the market just feels heavy right now. I’m curious what everyone thinks is weighing the most.

Option 2, peg gold at an extremely high price like $130K per ounce to wipe out the deficit.  This would make the dollar practically worthless.

Option 3, we remain a fiat currency.  According to the Triffin dilemma, we have to continue running trade deficits so the world can accumulate enough dollars to create liquidity.

The bigger question is what this says about the consumer. If people are pulling back on beer, even from a major player like STZ, does that mean discretionary spending is weakening more broadly? Or is this just a company-specific stumble? Either way, the reaction shows just how quickly investors will punish consumer names when demand looks shaky.

The studio announced Tuesday that it had inked a deal with Microsoft-owned Activision to develop, produce and distribute a live-action feature film based on the first-person shooter game.

“As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty this is truly a dream come true,” David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, said in a statement. “From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love.”

Paramount and Activision said they will honor the brand’s “rich narrative and distinctive style” for fans of the video game franchise. Call of Duty has been the best-selling video game series in the U.S. for 16 consecutive years, with more than 500 million copies sold globally.

“I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand,” Ellison said.

The deal is yet another major announcement from Paramount since it officially merged with Skydance in early August. Weeks later the studio announced it had signed The Duffer Brothers, the creative team of Matt and Ross Duffer who created Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” to a four-year agreement for feature films, television and streaming projects.

Paramount also bought the U.S. rights to UFC in a $7.7 billion, 7-year deal that starts in 2026.

Ellison said in an open letter shortly after the merger that the company would invest in “high-quality storytelling and cutting-edge technology” to help “define the next era of entertainment.”

1n6lf3n,2025-09-02,2025-09-02 10:44:17,Warren Buffett says he is ‘disappointed’ in Kraft Heinz split; shares fall 5%,"Warren Buffett told CNBC on Tuesday that he is disappointed in the Kraft Heinz split that unwinds much of the blockbuster merger he masterminded a decade ago.

With a 27.5% stake in the company, Berkshire Hathaway is Kraft Heinz’s largest shareholder. The firm has not touched its shares since the 2015 merger that formed the food conglomerate.

Shares of the company fell more than 3% following Buffett’s comments.

Buffett told CNBC’s Becky Quick on Tuesday that the merger didn’t turn out to be a brilliant idea, but he does not think that taking the company apart will fix its problems.

Greg Abel, who will take reins at Berkshire Hathaway from Buffett at the end of the year, expressed disappointment to Kraft Heinz, according to Buffett.

Kraft Heinz did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Buffett’s stance on the deal.

The split announced earlier on Tuesday once again separates Kraft Heinz into two companies: one focused on sauces, spreads and shelf-stable meals and a second that includes North American staples like Oscar Mayer, Kraft singles and Lunchables.

Berkshire Hathaway teamed up with private equity firm 3G Capital in 2015 to merge Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. 3G Capital quietly exited its Kraft Heinz investment in 2023, after years of periodically trimming its stake as the company struggled.

Though it holds a roster of iconic brands like Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, Kraft Heinz saw its U.S. sales slip just a few years after the merger. Health-conscious consumers were buying less packaged food and shopping more around the perimeter of the grocery store. Some analysts also blamed the company’s slump on cost-cutting measures that kept Kraft Heinz from investing in its brands at a time when they needed it most.

In an effort to turn around the business, Kraft Heinz sold off some of its portfolio, like Planters nuts and some of its cheese division. The company has also been investing in some of its brands, like Lunchables and Capri Sun. In May, Kraft Heinz executives said that the company was weighing strategic changes and potential transactions.

Even as other investors have lost faith in Kraft Heinz, Buffett has stood by the company.

Regarding Berkshire’s future as a Kraft Heinz investor, Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire will do whatever is in the best interest of the firm. If Berkshire is approached to sell its shares, the firm will not accept a block bid unless other shareholders receive the same offer, according to Buffett.

1n6kqml,2025-09-02,2025-09-02 10:18:21,"Musk looks past Tesla sales slump, says 80% of value will come from Optimus","Tesla CEO Elon Musk predicted that Optimus robots, which have yet to hit the market, will eventually make up more than three-quarters of his automaker’s value.

In a post on X on Monday, Musk wrote, ”\~80% of Tesla’s value will be Optimus.” In mid-2024, Musk predicted that Optimus robots would someday turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company, which was equal to more than half of the entire value of the S&P 500 at the time of his comment.

With Tesla in the midst of a multi-quarter sales slump due to competition from lower-cost Chinese competitors, an aging lineup of electric vehicles and Musk’s incendiary political rhetoric and involvement with the Trump administration, the world’s richest person has been trying to convince Wall Street to look to the future.

For Tesla, that dream revolves around a world filled with robotaxis and humanoid robots, powered by artificial intelligence.

“It is important to note that Tesla is by far the best in the world at real-world AI,” Musk said in the company’s second-quarter conference call with analysts in July.

The problem for Tesla is that it’s behind in those key markets.

In robotaxis, Tesla has only recently started tests in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, while Alphabet’s Waymo is live in numerous markets and reached 10 million paid trips in May. Baidu’s Apollo Go is live in China.

Meanwhile, competition in humanoid robots is coming from the likes of Chinese companies like Unitree, which won multiple medals at the World Humanoid Robot Games. Others in the space include Boston Dynamics, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, 1X and Figure.

Musk said in March that Tesla plans to make 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year. In its first-quarter shareholder deck, Tesla said it was on target for “builds of Optimus on our Fremont pilot production line in 2025, with wider deployment of bots doing useful work across our factories.”

Tesla recently lost the person running the division.

Milan Kovac, Tesla’s vice president of Optimus robotics, announced his departure in June after nine years at the company.

Tesla is developing Optimus with the aim of someday selling it as a bipedal, intelligent robot capable of everything from factory work to babysitting.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is “subject to SEC approval” and would “save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”

“Did you ever hear the statement that, ‘China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!’” Trump said.

The wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.

“In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” the pair wrote.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.

Supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.

Not sure how likely this is with SCOTUS but the last time Bessent ""warned"" what would happen if their tariffs were voided they lost in the appeals court decision. 

So this could be another signal that they aren't confident in the legality of about half of these tariffs implemented so far (regardless of him saying he's confident)

I'm curious about what companies will be the biggest winners if they are forced to give tariff refunds.

The Labor Department is preparing for what would amount to a news and data blackout should the U.S. government suspend operations.

In a contingency plan released Friday, the department said it was looking “to ensure that DOL agencies can perform an orderly suspension of programs and operations should a lapse occur, while continuing those limited activities authorized to continue during a lapse.”


While the department’s scope covers a multitude of areas, the impact on data releases will be pressing for investors. The DOL, in conjunction with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has several key reports upcoming that will provide important clues about the direction of the economy and inform Federal Reserve policymakers ahead of their next meeting in October.

“BLS will suspend all operations,” the 73-page plan stated. “Economic data that are scheduled to be released during the lapse will not be released",1338,194,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm8my/labor_department_wont_be_releasing_data_including/,month,Broad market news,0.98

>Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.

>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen.

>In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4‑1/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

During a speech in Providence, Rhode Island, the central bank leader was asked how much emphasis he and his colleagues place on market prices and whether they have a higher tolerance for higher values.

> “We do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we’re trying to achieve,” Powell said. “But you’re right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued.” In the run-up to last week’s policy meetings, stocks and other assets rallied strongly as conviction grew that that the Federal Open Market Committee would be lowering its benchmark overnight borrowing rate. Stocks have continued to climb, setting a succession of record highs for major averages, since the decision Wednesday to cut by a quarter percentage point.

1nhmzq8,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 10:13:32,Alphabet becomes fourth company to reach $3 trillion market cap,"Alphabet has joined the $3 trillion club.

Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company into territory occupied only by Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple.

The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust ruling by a judge, whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year a district court ruled that the company held an illegal monopoly in search and related advertising.

But Judge Amit Mehta decided against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President Donald Trump congratulated the company and called it “a very good day.”

Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared to the 15% gain for the Nasdaq.

The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google’s IPO and a little more than 10 years after of the creation of Alphabet as a holding company, with Google its prime subsidiary. .

CEO Sundar Pichai was named CEO of Alphabet in 2019, replacing co-founder Larry Page. Pichai’s latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through while also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up helping Google land the recent favorable antitrust ruling. The company’s hopes of becoming a major AI player largely ride with Gemini, Google’s flagship suite of AI models.

The cloud giant is on pace for its best day since 1999, and is now quickly approaching the $1 trillion market cap benchmark

The company said it has $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 359% from a year earlier.

“This is a very historic kind of print right here from Oracle with this backlog,” Ben Reitzes, technology research head at Melius Research, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Tuesday. “The Street was looking for about $180 billion in RPO and they’re talking about a number that is a multiple of that. That is astounding.”

Oracle now sees $18 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in the 2026 fiscal year, with the company calling for the annual sum to reach $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion and $144 billion over the subsequent four years.

Other analysts were left “blown away” and “in shock.” D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria called it “absolutely staggering on CNBC’s “Fast Money.” Wells Fargo analysts said it was a “momentous confirmation” of the artificial intelligence trade.

1nnpqxs,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 11:33:55,Markets And Gold Are Both Hitting ATHs. Last Time That Happened Was...,"COVID, which as a rare global event driven by a pandemic. Then, before that, in 2007. Right before it hit the fan in 2008 with the financial crisis.

Historically, gold and the markets have been divergent. When people are optimistic, they pile into the markets. When they get worried, they move into gold. It's pretty rare to see them both hitting ATHs at the same time. I am curious to hear your thoughts on this.

From my perspective, it seems all of society is bifurcated right now on just about everything. We have a large group of Chicken Little's, that think this is all going to blow up in our faces any day now. Even Warren/Berkshire is holding a record amount of cash and more T-Bills that the Treasury itself ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/why-warren-buffett-s-berkshire-hathaway-now-owns-more-treasury-bills-than-the-federal-reserve-11807572)). Conversely, we seem to have an equal size group of Pollyanna's that think we are entering into some sort of golden age and manage to find a silver lining in every bit of news (pun intended). I am somewhat agnostic and think both groups are not seeing things too clearly. At the end of the day, it is the optimistic crowd that drives the markets and set the prices. If they keep thinking they are getting a good deal and remain willing buy what the others are selling, and they believe in it enough to hold, then the markets will just keep going up or possibly plateau for a while until some external event drives them in either direction.

There is lots of money going into specific buckets right now, such as AI and crypto, which is also hitting ATHs. I have no idea what people think they will do with the stupid amount of money flowing into crypto and its offshoot financial products (other than trying to make a quick buck). And I think all the AI plays will take much longer to shake out and find the winners and losers than most people think (like the dot-com era). I view AI stocks with mind numbing P/Es, precious metals, and crypto as all something investors would need a high level of conviction and a buy-and-hold mindset to buy into right now at these levels. And I question how much conviction is really there.

With both groups (Chicken Little's and Pollyanna's) buying into both sides of fear and optimism, it seems like every scenario is priced in. It's like a double bubble face-off that just keeps growing, just waiting for something to happen. Even if more geopolitical turmoil erupts and/or inflation starts ticking back up with high unemployment, are people really going to buy in more to precious metals when they are at ATHs already? Without hitting the bottom line in spectacular fashion, is there any development that can get AI more hyped and inflated while we wait for it to generate a real ROI somewhere? And what if nothing happens at all and things more-or-less stay the same economically and geopolitically?",989,343,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnpqxs/markets_and_gold_are_both_hitting_aths_last_time/,month,Unknown,0.93

> Elon Musk this week urged his followers to cancel their Netflix  subscriptions over a controversy surrounding an animated show and its creator. Musk on Wednesday posted on his X platform saying, “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids.” The post was in response to an image accusing Netflix of carrying out a “transgender woke agenda.” The controversy seems to stem from conservative backlash over an animated Netflix show, “Dead End: Paranormal Park,” which features a transgender character. The show was canceled in 2023 after two seasons.

> In addition to several anti-trans posts, Musk also responded to a post criticizing alleged statements made by the show’s creator, Hamish Steele, that a prominent conservative X account said “mocked” the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Steele responded to Musk’s callout on rival social media platform Bluesky saying, “It’s probably going to be a very odd day.” Steele also shared a post by TV writer Jack Bernhardt that called “Dead End” a “brilliant show about kind, wonderful characters.” Also this week, vocal conservative activist Robby Starbuck began posting about Netflix, echoing anti-trans sentiments and arguing the company has promoted an ideology that is “hateful to White Americans.” Starbuck, who has repeatedly targeted major corporations in recent months over diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, said in one of his X posts on Netflix, “No one should give this woke company another dime.”

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed by just a majority vote on the SEC, where Republicans currently hold a 3-1 voting majority, with one open seat.

1n9dojz,2025-09-05,2025-09-05 14:52:50,Elon Musk New Pay Package is the Inverse of what is institutional knowledge,"They just released his new 1 trillon dollar pay package that in order to hit would require certain targets. This is the only time that I've seen so many inverse things happen like this.

* Giving a founder additional shares to do his job just to motivate him when the majority of his wealth is based on Tesla in the first place, Refreshers are normal and option plans are normal, but needing 1T worth of them is not.
* They think that old Elon who used to captivate an audience through being progressive and promoting the future... will somehow return (not only has he lost steam for promising lofty ideas but people are finally tired of broken promises by him, every year its another almost there target for self driving. Also where is the new roadster?)
* Everyone is tired of Elon standing on stage trying to compute how to speak  as he jumps around and does salutes ""as a joke""  vs someone who sits back and builds out the company to its full potential
* The company still caters to a a high end, well educated consumer for their products. As soon as he lost the base for it he did all the damage control he could. He literally tried to have Trump sell his cars on the Whitehouse green, that's how desperate its got for him crying on twitch (a gaming platform) about people hating him.
* The board of directors is  stacked in his favor but also is so fearful of him that they won't standup to him. They at least have enough of a spine to make sure he hits targets to get his package. Although he will never meet those goals so I guess if you are an Elon Supporter this is great news (your lord is staying around) if you are inbetween you know what you are getting and if you hate him, well he has a giant carrot Infront of him to do something.

I think that the pay package is so strange as somehow he will recover the mess he created. If I joined a company (as Elon joined Tesla, he didn't create it) then got it to the position where he risked everything to make it the brand/success it is, then tanked it by his political/ketamine rants, then was offered 1T to act normal and bring it all back.... I'd be the luckiest person on earth. This story is bonkers.

**I'd rather see they pay someone a 1 trillion dollar pay package to wipe Elon's image out of the Tesla picture or** associated with Elon. A rebrand to being progressive, for human rights, and a environmental company .

This is the strangest pay package I've ever seen. The bottom line is, if they hired any reputable CEO that can re-establish the brand of being a modern, progressive company, they would be back on track, not trying to force this monstrosity back into its cage with money.

Tesla in Europe, China, and even North America sales are steadily declining, tax credit offsets are ending, the company needs a new face, and Elon is the worst way to promote what was once the progressive movement.

EDIT:  
To everyone saying that if they don't offer this up he'll leave and either start another competitor or destroy the brand. The issue is the brand is destroyed already by someone who tweets about illegal aliens and governement conspiracies all day and night. How has his ventures gone since he became the DOGE psychopath? XAi is a dumster fire of VC money, Boring Company has.... built a tunnel under vegas convention center that has human drivers for robo taxi's, sales have steadily declined, solar and battery have been taken over by other companies, uhhh what am I missing?

Alphabet Inc.’s Google was fined almost €3 billion ($3.5 billion) by the European Union and ordered to stop favoring its own advertising technology services, in a move that risks further inflaming tensions with US President Donald Trump.
The European Commission said Friday that Google had abused its dominance by giving its own ad exchanges a competitive advantage over rivals and that it must bring the practices to an end.

“When markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power,” EU antitrust commissioner Teresa Ribera said in a statement. “True freedom means a level playing field, where everyone competes on equal terms and citizens have a genuine right to choose.”

The company immediately vowed to appeal. Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice president for regulatory affairs at Google, said the move “imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money.”

The EU punishment comes at a tense moment for EU–US trade relations, with Trump repeatedly deriding the bloc’s efforts to rein in Silicon Valley giants. Although Google faces antitrust scrutiny worldwide, it won some relief this week when a US judge ruled that its search business would not need to be broken up to address the harms alleged by the Department of Justice.

Google’s adtech operations, however, also remain under threat in the US. The DOJ is expected to file proposed remedies later on Friday, ahead of a Sept. 22 hearing on those proposals. Previously, the department had floated forcing Google to divest its Ad Manager platform to tackle the alleged anticompetitive risks.

The EU warned Google in 2023 that it had abused its dominance in advertising technology to harm online publishers. At the time, the Brussels-based commission said Google had favored its own ad exchange program over its rivals and bolstered the company’s central role in the ad tech supply chain.
Ribera’s predecessor Margrethe Vestager warned then that only a “mandatory divestment” of part of its business would solve the issues. The Dane had spent a decade in Brussels, where she hit Google with fines of more than €8 billion across three different cases, although one penalty was annulled and another cut by EU judges.",715,216,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n98aaa/google_fined_almost_3_billion_by_eu_for_abusing/,month,Company News,0.95
1nxidln,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 22:34:33,Reddit (RDDT) - Everyone’s Missing What Actually Happened,"
Position: Long 1 contract, Jan 2026 $210 Call (+$362.50)

TL;DR: The 7% drop from “ChatGPT citations declining” is the most misunderstood selloff I’ve seen this year. Google just handed Reddit pricing power on a silver platter.

-----

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED:

Sept 10: Google kills num=100 parameter
→ Search APIs can only pull 10-20 results instead of 100
→ Reddit content (ranked 11-100) disappears from scraped data
→ ChatGPT citations drop from 14% to 2%
→ Stock tanks from $240 to $207

Wall Street sees: “Reddit losing AI relevance”

I see: “Reddit just got monopoly pricing on their content”

-----

THE SETUP EVERYONE’S MISSING:

Before: OpenAI scraped Reddit for free via Google

After: OpenAI must pay Reddit directly for API access

This isn’t Reddit losing value. This is Google eliminating Reddit’s free rider problem.

THE MATH:

Current confirmed deals:

- Google: $60M/year
- OpenAI: ~$60M/year
- Total AI licensing run rate: $200M+

They’re negotiating “dynamic pricing” = pay per use

If usage drives pricing and free access just got killed, what happens to those numbers?

Do the math. It’s not going down.

-----

THE CITATION DROP ACTUALLY PROVES THE THESIS:

Stock moved 14% on an 86% citation drop.

Think about that.

One metric from one AI platform moved a $30B company 14%.

That’s not weakness. That’s dependency.

ChatGPT can’t function without Reddit’s UGC. Neither can Perplexity. Neither can Google’s AI.

They just lost free access.

Now they pay, or their AI gets dumber.

-----

WHY REDDIT WINS THIS:

1. Content moat nobody can replicate

- 100M daily users having real conversations
- Every niche topic covered
- Continuously updated
- 18 years of archived knowledge

1. Q2 fundamentals crushed it

- $501M revenue (+84% YoY)
- Just turned profitable
- 97M DAU (+51% YoY)
- Positive free cash flow

1. AI companies have no alternatives

- Stack Overflow? Smaller, tech-only
- Quora? Dead
- Discord? Private, not indexed
- Twitter? Toxic wasteland
- Where else do you get quality UGC at scale?

1. Google just eliminated their competition

- Can’t scrape Reddit via Google anymore
- Must use Reddit’s direct API
- Reddit sets the price

-----

THE BEAR CASE (because I’m not an idiot):

- Negotiations could fail
- OpenAI might reduce Reddit dependency
- Valuation still rich at 8x sales
- User experience degrading from over-monetization
- Competition could emerge

These are real risks. I’m not ignoring them.

But the risk/reward at $207 after a panic sell on misunderstood news?

That’s the setup I want.

-----

WHAT I’M WATCHING:

Bullish catalysts:

- New OpenAI deal announced (higher rates)
- Q3 earnings showing AI revenue acceleration
- Additional platform partnerships
- Dynamic pricing implementation

Bearish catalysts:

- Failed negotiations
- User growth slowdown
- Continued citation decline without revenue growth
- Management fumbling this opportunity

-----

MY ACTUAL THESIS:

The market saw “citations down” and panic sold.

Smart money should see “free access eliminated, paid access mandatory.”

Google didn’t hurt Reddit. Google just forced every AI company to negotiate directly with Reddit.

And Reddit owns content nobody else has.

That’s pricing power.

The Jan 2026 $210 call gives me:

- 3 months to see Q3 earnings
- Time for new deal announcements
- Exposure to re-rating if market figures this out
- Limited downside (premium paid)

This is 2% of my portfolio. High conviction on thesis, sized appropriately for execution risk.

-----

What am I missing? Where’s the hole in this logic?

Genuinely want to stress test this before adding to the position.

Not financial advice. I own calls. Do your own research.

But if you think I’m wrong, tell me why in the comments.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",707,205,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nxidln/reddit_rddt_everyones_missing_what_actually/,month,Company Discussion,0.89

2. isn't already owned by big tech (Mag 7)

Reddit is a destination site, unlike the Google/Bing/Wiki sites that rank in the top, which I see more as tools, and It is also relatively small at  less than $40B market cap today.

I remain bullish mainly because Reddit is becoming one of few properties where you can still find human generated content (yes, lots of bots, but still lots of real humans) that's not just about what your friend had for dinner.

In a world where internet content is increasing filled with AI slop, human content will become more valuable. So given the above, I think it's a no brainer to allocate a portion of my portfolio for long term hold.

This is quite the circular economy we got going here. By investing in the deeply unprofitable startup that buys their product, they ensure demand for their products remains strong.

Probably the right move for Nvidia, because a lot of this money will come back to them, and they can sell their hardware at high Margins. And with their stock trading at 50x earnings, it makes sense to spend their cash flow on funding/acquiring AI startups rather than buying back shares.

1nj9v93,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 06:54:22,China bans tech companies from buying Nvidia’s AI chips,"     China’s internet regulator has banned the country’s biggest technology companies from buying Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips, as Beijing steps up efforts to boost its domestic industry and compete with the US.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) told companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s tailor-made product for the country, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Several companies had indicated they would order tens of thousands of the RTX Pro 6000D, and had started testing and verification work with Nvidia’s server suppliers, the people said.

After receiving the CAC order, the companies told their suppliers to stop the work, the people added.

The ban goes beyond earlier guidance from regulators that focused on the H20, Nvidia’s other China-only chip widely used for AI. It comes after Chinese regulators concluded that domestic chips had attained performance comparable to those of Nvidia’s models used in China.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, told reporters in London on Wednesday that he expected to discuss the chipmaker’s ability to do business in China with Donald Trump that evening during the US president’s state visit to the UK.

“We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,” he said. “I’m disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I’m understanding of that. We are patient about it.” 

Beijing is putting pressure on Chinese tech companies to boost the country’s homegrown semiconductor industry and break their reliance on Nvidia so it can compete in an AI race against the US.

“The message is now loud and clear,” said an executive at one of the tech companies. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it’s all hands on deck to build the domestic system.”

Nvidia started producing chips tailored for the Chinese market after former US President Joe Biden banned the company from exporting its most powerful products to China, in an effort to rein in Beijing’s progress on AI.

Beijing’s regulators have recently summoned domestic chipmakers such as Huawei and Cambricon, as well as Alibaba and search engine giant Baidu, which also make their own semiconductors, to report how their products compare against Nvidia’s China chips, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.

They concluded that China’s AI processors had reached a level comparable to or exceeding that of the Nvidia products allowed under export controls, the person added.

China says Nvidia violated antitrust law when it bought Mellanox

The Financial Times reported last month that China’s chipmakers were seeking to triple the country’s total output of AI processors next year.

“The top-level consensus now is there’s going to be enough domestic supply to meet demand without having to buy Nvidia chips,” said an industry insider.

Nvidia introduced the RTX Pro 6000D in July during Huang’s visit to Beijing, when the US company also said Washington was easing its previous ban on the H20 chip.

China’s regulators, including the CAC, have warned tech companies against buying Nvidia’s H20, asking them to justify having purchased them over domestic products, the FT reported last month.

The RTX Pro 6000D, which the company has said could be used in automated manufacturing, was the last product Nvidia was allowed to sell in China in significant volumes.

Alibaba, ByteDance, the CAC and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1nirgbf,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 15:37:42,Microsoft announces $30 billion investment in AI infrastructure in UK,"Microsoft said on Tuesday that it plans to invest $30 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.K. by 2028.

The investment includes $15 billion in capital expenditures and $15 billion in its U.K. operations, Microsoft said. The company said the investment would enable it to build the U.K.’s “largest supercomputer,” with more than 23,000 advanced graphics processing units, in partnership with Nscale, a British cloud computing firm.

The spending commitment comes as President Donald Trump embarks on a state visit to Britain. Trump arrived in the U.K. Tuesday evening and is set to be greeted at Windsor Castle on Wednesday by King Charles and Queen Camilla.

During his visit, all eyes are on U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is under pressure to bring stability to the country after the exit of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over a house tax scandal and a major cabinet reshuffle.

On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said his stance on the U.K. has warmed over the years. He previously criticized the country over its attempt in 2023 to block the tech giant’s $69 billion acquisition of video game developer Activision-Blizzard. The deal was cleared by the U.K.s competition regulator later that year.

“I haven’t always been optimistic every single day about the business climate in the U.K.,” Smith said. However, he added, “I am very encouraged by the steps that the government has taken over the last few years.”

“Just a few years ago, this kind of investment would have been inconceivable because of the regulatory climate then and because there just wasn’t the need or demand for this kind of large AI investment,” Smith said.

Starmer and Trump are expected to sign a new deal Wednesday “to unlock investment and collaboration in AI, Quantum, and Nuclear technologies,” the government said in a statement late Tuesday.

Back then zero commission trading was unheard of. As a 21 year old trying to buy Tesla, logging into Scotttrade and paying commissions every single time felt like a huge barrier. Robinhood completely changed that and honestly changed the whole industry for the better.

But the app today feels very different. It has turned into a so called “super app” that constantly pushes Gold, nags you to roll over retirement accounts, and adds features that feel more like gambling than investing. The contract trading section especially just seems predatory.

I stuck with Robinhood through everything. I was not even mad during the GameStop Citadel mess when trading was locked. I defended them and even made YouTube videos back in the day recommending Robinhood to beginners.

This morning I finally moved everything to Fidelity with an ACATS transfer. I also signed up for their 2 percent cash back credit card and will funnel the rewards into index funds. At this point it just feels like the smarter move for where I am now.

Not trying to convince anyone, but after nearly a decade it feels like closing a chapter. Maybe I just grew up.

1nqm5g2,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 19:35:41,Tesla’s continuing sales slump in Europe weighs on stock price,"Tesla shares fell more than 4% on Thursday after data out of Europe showed a continuing sales slump for the automaker, despite strong demand for fully electric vehicles in the region. 

Tesla EV registrations in Europe, a proxy for sales, fell by about 23% year-over-year in August, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) on Thursday.

There were 14,831 Tesla EV registrations in Europe last month, down from 19,136 in August 2024. In the first eight months of this year, Tesla EV registrations in Europe declined 32.6%, the ACEA said.

Meanwhile, total EV registrations throughout the region rose by around 26% through August compared to the same period in 2024. By contrast, registrations for petrol and diesel-powered vehicles declined by more than 20% over that stretch.

Still, RBC analysts wrote in a note on Thursday that they expect Tesla’s total deliveries for the third quarter could amount to 456,000, above a FactSet-compiled consensus of 448,000 deliveries and a Visible Alpha consensus of 440,000 deliveries.

The analysts expect a bump for Tesla as consumers rush to buy EVs in the U.S. before a $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of September.

Even with Thursday’s slide, Tesla’s stock has bounced back following a brutal start to the year. It’s now up 5% in 2025 after plunging 36% in the first quarter.

Musk’s political activism in the U.S. and beyond has hurt the Tesla brand and dampened its appeal to many prospective EV buyers.

Earlier this year, Musk endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party, and this month he appeared by video at an anti-immigrant rally in the U.K. that turned violent. The rally was led by activist Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rebuked Musk for “dangerous” comments that he made at the rally, where 26 police officers were injured. Musk told attendees, “violence is coming to you” and “you either fight back or you die.”

To revitalize interest in the brand, Tesla has said an affordable new model is in the works, which could help it fend off increased competition from the likes of Volkswagen, BYD and other EV makers that have been picking up market share.

1nuhymn,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 12:32:23,Pfizer Gets Three-Year Grace Period From Trump Pharma Tariffs,"Bloomberg) -- Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said the company secured a three-year grace period from President Donald Trump’s promised tariffs on pharmaceuticals in a deal that would lower some of its US drug prices.

The company will sell some products at a 50% average discount on a direct-to-consumer website called TrumpRx, an initiative intended to allow Americans to pay cash for drugs at discounted rates negotiated by the government.

The deal appears to resolve two major threats facing Pfizer, as it would stave off more damaging drug pricing policies while shielding the company from future tariffs imposed by the administration’s Section 232 investigation into whether the cost of medicine represents a national security threat. 

It’s the latest example of the transactional nature of winning tariff exemptions from Trump, who has unilaterally wielded trade policy to exert power over multiple industries. As recently as last week, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on the industry. 

As part of its deal, Pfizer will offer across-the-board reductions on US prices for Americans enrolled in the Medicaid insurance program, giving them “most favored nation” pricing on some of its medicines, Trump said. He has repeatedly pressured companies to bring their US prices in line with what foreign countries pay for medicines.

“The United States is done subsidizing the health care of the rest of the world,” Trump said.

Bourla also announced a $70 billion push on research and development and domestic manufacturing over the next few years. The company was one of the rare exceptions among major drugmakers who rushed to highlight the return of manufacturing facilities to the US amid pressure from Trump.

“We now have the certainty and stability we need on two critical fronts, tariffs and pricing, that have suppressed the industry’s valuations to historic lows,” Bourla said in a statement.",420,144,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuhymn/pfizer_gets_threeyear_grace_period_from_trump/,month,Company News,0.96

1nvg1dy,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 14:19:43,"Reminder - Tesla sales trending down, maybe unprofitable 3Q from no emissions credits, and taxi still has safety drivers - stock UP 30% Lol","The absurdity of Tesla knows no bounds. 

* Publicly available China sales data- which is about 35% of Tesla's sales - is still down 9% year over year, and Europe sales are still falling. American sales expect a bump due to loss of tax credits, but with Elon's alignment with Trump in the US generally hurting American sales, and significantly increased EV competition in the US, that bump is likely to be marginable at best. Accordingly, Tesla EV sales are still virtually guaranteed to be down year over year this quarter, stagnant at best. Remember, in 2020 Elon and Tesla bulls were projecting a ramp up to 20 million car sales per year (traditional EV sales, not robotaxi sales) by 2030. They've been stagnant - now decreasing - at under 2 million car sales for over a year now. 



* Worse still, the revenue from automotive regulatory credits will drop to zero starting this quarter, as emissions penalties were eliminated under the Trump administration. Notably, those emissions credits have accounted for, on average, 50% of Tesla's net income over the past 5 quarters; and, 1Q2025 would have actually had a negative net income of -$186 million without the $595 million in income from selling automotive regulatory credits that quarter. 



* And, while robotaxi is interesting and technologically, looks like it's trending towards feasibly working, Tesla still has safety drivers in the markets its operating in -which is mainly Austin at the moment - despite Musk saying it would reach half the U.S. population by the end of the year.  And, recent autonomous driving disclosures to the NHTSA indicate that in the most recent August month Tesla had 3 accidents for having less than 30 cars on the road, a ratio of 0.3/car/month. Waymo, in contrast had 51 incident reports in August for its 1,500 cars on the road across the country, a ratio 0.03/car/month and a factor of 10 less incidents per car per month than Tesla. And, while Musk has touted that Tesla is the leader in robotaxi for something like 8 years now, not only has Waymo factually rendered more autonomous rides with dramatically more mileage and, at this point, had demonstrated to be a working technology; but more and more competitors are popping up, such as Zoox in the U.S.; and pony.ai, BYD, and Baidu in Asia. Which is to say, competition is coming, and some would say has already come and surpassed Tesla, for the robotaxi space as well. 



* Additionally, if one takes a step back and compares the robotaxi market to the current ride-share market - as that's likely what it will displace since most people that own cars will presumably still want to have their own car - even assuming mature, robust market share and profit margins, the valuation is still probably under $300 range. For example, by my back of the envelope math there were approximately 100 billion ride share miles rendered worldwide in 2024. If you assume Tesla had 50% of that market (which is generally an unheard of market share in a market with decent competitions - Apple, for example, has a 25% global market share); and, assuming that, pursuant to Musk's own projections, the cyber cab was able to get cost per mile down to $0.30/mile, and they charged a reasonable $1/mile to riders, and that does not go lower with more competition; that would give 100 billion miles \* 0.5 market share \* $0.70 profit per mile = $35 billion profit off of robotaxis per year. $35 billion/3.4 billion shares = $10.29 per share and giving that a P/E of 30 gives you $308 target price. In other words, in a mature industry where Tesla robotaxi's had global reach and 50% market share, and profit margins of 70% per mile, the high price is still only $300 a share. 

**Tesla is up 30% this month to $450 a share as of today**, and likely trending towards a P/E of over 300 as it's EV sales profits are likely trending towards a range of $1 to $2. **Gotta love the American stock market!**",395,296,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nvg1dy/reminder_tesla_sales_trending_down_maybe/,month,Company Discussion,0.88

An independent researcher who publishes as Troy Teslike on Patreon predicted 481,000 deliveries for the quarter. Tesla distributed a company-compiled consensus on Sept. 26, which said analysts were expecting 443,079 deliveries.

The expected inflation, combined with an increasingly weak job market, sets the stage for the expected next week's Fed interest rate cut. There was a 92% chance of a 25 bp cut and 8% chance of a 50 bp cut prior to this morning's CPI report.

Wall Street is looking forward to a more aggressive trajectory of rate cuts alongside the slowing jobs market.  A growing number of economists now forecast a quarter-point rate cut at each of this year’s three remaining meetings, instead of just two cuts. 

""The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.4 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in August, after rising 0.2 percent in July, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 2.9 percent before seasonal adjustment.

The index for shelter rose 0.4 percent in August and was the largest factor in the all items monthly increase. The food index increased 0.5 percent over the month as the food at home index rose 0.6 percent and the food away from home index increased 0.3 percent. The index for energy rose 0.7 percent in August as the index for gasoline increased 1.9 percent over the month.

The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.3 percent in August, as it did in July. Indexes that increased over the month include airline fares, used cars and trucks, apparel, and new vehicles.

Now, Nvidia isn't just a supplier anymore; they're a massive strategic investor.

Does this mean Microsoft's influence is significantly reduced? Is their ""special relationship"" with OpenAI over? Are they now just one of two major partners, or does the Nvidia deal sideline them in the long run? It seems like OpenAI is diversifying its dependencies in a big way.

1napdma,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 06:02:37,OPEN Reality Check: From Someone Who Actually Built the Products You're Betting On,"*TL;DR:* While I'm rooting for OPEN long-term, the current price will correct down significantly. If you have profits, seriously consider taking some. This is deep in casino mode now - be warned.

Former OPEN leader here. More importantly, I’ve diamond-handed OPEN stock for years. I rode $OPEN up, then all the way down to 50¢. If you've only been holding for weeks, listen up. (*Update*: If my background is a distraction, ignore - most of my points below are public information anyway)

I also spent years protecting regular people from financial predators. The pump-and-dump energy around OPEN right now feels very familiar.

Over the weekend I talked to a few folks ready to jump in without realizing this is pure casino mode -  that’s what pushed me to write this up. If you already know OPEN is pure casino now, no need to keep reading - you likely know the rest already or do not care.

# Where We Are: Phenomenal Momentum, Terrible Risk/Reward

The $OPEN chart might as well have 🚀 on it. Golden Cross, record volume, RSI overbought - every meme signal is flashing. So we got a whopping 10x move from 50¢ in June to $6+ now.

But here’s the problem: options even with the new peak today give you less than 20% odds of hitting $12 in the next few months. 

Translation: you might roll a 6 and 2x, but odds are higher you get smacked with a 40–50% downdraft. 

This rally is priced to flame out in weeks, not years. Think before you YOLO because your buddy doubled last week.

# What Insiders Are Actually Doing

Forget charts. Look at the people with the most information.

* **Carrie** (former CEO)**:** As soon as she was **free** to sell after leaving, she unloaded \~$35M at $5/share. Usually that’s all you need to know.
* **Shrisha** (interim CEO): Yes, bought 30k shares - first insider buy I remember. Props, but symbolic. He already had a [4,250,000](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000180116925000078/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1756411509.xml) share grant, and his cash comp just jumped by [another $500k-$1M](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000114036125033195/ef20054807_8ka.htm). A 30k buy is <1% of his stake and covered by his raise. To be clear, I'm rooting for him and have been very impressed by his leadership, but that buy isn't something you should make big bets on.
* **Veterans:** Every insider free to sell I've talked to has sold everything (except one). That includes 10-year veterans who have seen it all. And more telling: no one is buying.

Sure, insiders sell for all kinds of reasons. But here’s the pattern: nobody was buying at $2 - and they sure aren’t buying at $6–7. that tells you everything.

# Why the Bull Arguments Don't Hold Water

I hear the bull cases - “I will wait for Fed cuts / new CEO / earnings.” Here’s why they don’t stack up:

* **Rates: Already Baked In** The stock trades higher now than when rates were close to zero and Opendoor was doing 5x the revenue. A predictable 25 bps cut in two weeks? Classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” (look it up) - the price might actually drop. 
* **Q3 Earnings Will Be Brutal:** Don't take my word for it. Opendoor's own [guidance](https://www.opendoor.com/articles/2025-second-quarter-financial-results) shows revenue dropping 50% from Q2's $1.57B to just $800-875M in Q3. They also forecast returning to losses: adjusted EBITDA loss of $21-28M after barely eking out a $23M profit in Q2. How do you think retail buyers will react when earnings show a 50% revenue drop?
* **New CEO Won't Be Magic:** Short of hiring Elon Musk, no new CEO can justify a 5x-10x price jump alone. The business model challenges remain the same regardless of who's in charge. Leadership takes time. This market won’t wait.

# Bottom Line

I'm not saying OPEN is worthless or to trash the company. I genuinely want the company, and the years of work by some of the most talented people I have known, to be lasting. The Q2 2025 positive EBITDA of $23M was a monumental achievement after years of losses.

But this 1000% rally has priced in years of perfect execution. You're betting everything goes right - housing recovers, margins improve, debt becomes manageable.

Even if the next two weeks are great, the next few months will likely be ugly. Q3 earnings will show that 50% revenue drop. The new CEO search will take time. Rate cuts won't magically fix the business model. And when reality hits, this thing will fall fast.

**If you have profits:** Take some off the table. Insiders sold at well below $5, you're sitting at $6-7.

**If you believe long-term:** Wait for a better entry point. This isn't your last chance.

**If you're speculating:** Set stops and don't risk money you can't lose.

I know I'll get hate from true believers (whom I respect) and from pumpers looking for exit liquidity. That's fine. Call me a pessimist or worse - that's better than watching ordinary people get wrecked.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.47 adjusted vs. $1.48 expected
* **Revenue:** $14.93 billion vs. $15.04 billion expected

Revenue increased 12% from a year earlier during the quarter, which ended on Aug. 31, according to a statement. Net income was about flat at $2.93 billion, or $1.01 per share, compared to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Oracle said its remaining performance obligation, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been contracted, now stands at $455 billion, up some 359% from a year earlier. During the quarter OpenAI said it signed an agreement with Oracle to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity.

Alongside larger cloud providers such as Microsoft, Oracle has been one of the big winners of the AI boom, due to its cloud infrastructure business and its access to Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) needed for large workloads. CEO Safra Catz said in the statement that the company signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the quarter.

Also in the quarter, Oracle said cloud rival Google’s Gemini artificial intelligence models would become available on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure.

Oracle shares hit a record last month and are up 45% in 2025 as of Tuesday’s close, while the S&P 500 index has gained 11%.

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

Their quarterly revenue a year from now will likely be above corweaves current quarterly revenue. But with less debt and better margins. Coreweave is currently valued at 60 billion, roughly 3x nebius. 

I think it’s even possible that nebius q3 revenue next year is 50% higher than coreweaves last quarter revenue.

And the wild thing is that many feel that coreweave is currently undervalued right now.

To me it seems like there is very low risk thanks to the Microsoft contract, and very high reward. If buying calls, potentially a 15x on your money if they hit 60 billion market cap 1 year from now.

Or am I missing something? Does someone have a deeper analysis to tell me why I’m crazy? Because I feel like I am right now.

One common argument on here is that Google's business model is not threatened by OpenAI, because the highest value searches (shopping related ones) are still done through Google, whereas OpenAI is capturing lower value queries.  So while people turn to LLMs for general questions, they still use Google for online shopping and click on sponsored ads. 

Most importantly, online retailers looking to advertise to people that are directly searching for their type of product really only had Google/Yahoo/Bing as an option, and Google had the majority of market share.

Today OpenAI killed this theory. OpenAI is in the process of integrating shopping directly into ChatGPT. It is still in its early stages, right now only supporting Etsy, and will soon rollout to Shopify. These platforms pay OpenAI for driving sales. 

CPC and CPM for Google ads are notoriously expensive, so if this goes well, expect more online retailers to implement deals with OpenAI, and cut Google ad spend as OpenAI drivers higher return on investment and such announcements boost share price. 

This is a much safer form of performance based advertising. Paying per click on Google ads is risky, because a click doesn't guarantee a sale. If OpenAI is charging a fee based on the final sale rather than per click, this makes marketing ROI much easier to predict.",262,130,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntsp96/openai_launching_instant_checkout_working_with/,month,Company News,0.8

Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

• **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

• **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

• **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
• AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
• Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
• More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
• New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
• Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
• Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
• Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
• Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
• Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
• Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
• Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
• High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
• Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
• Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
• Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
• Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
• Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
• Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
• Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
• Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",263,114,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/,month,Company Discussion,0.83

1nhozun,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 11:28:53,How do I (27M) convince my dad (68M) to stop gambling on individual stocks?,"My dad comfortably retired around 13 years ago from a good business he owned. He was able to build a strong nest egg to coast through retirement easily, even if he just kept it in lower-interest assets yielding 3-4% per annum.

As for me, I've began my investing journey around 3 years ago and adopted a relatively conservative approach. By this I mean I hold around

* 30% cash in high-yield accounts (3-4%)
* 20% in a retirement account (6%)
* roughly 50% in a mixture of ETFs, individual stocks and crypto. Breakdown would be:
   * 35% ETFs tracking S&P500
   * 13% individual stocks
   * 2% crypto

This entire breakdown is derived from my entire net worth, I'm debt-free and projecting retirement in my early 40s.

Now going back to my dad, we've had several conversations about stocks & investments over the years, many of which have raised strong questions from me over his investing style. Let me name a few to paint a better picture:

* He's taken a nearly $2-3 million dollar loan to invest into more stocks (paid back almost half the loan)
* Majority of his investments are individual stocks, many of which consists of penny/speculative stocks that have tanked -80% all the way to delisting.
   * Huge chunk in GoPro in 2015, still holding to today with massive losses and no plans to sell and reallocate
   * Another huge chunk in (actinium pharma), which tanked nearly 90% due to not receiving FDA approval
* Several huge investments in mutual funds with high management fees (1.5-2%) which are either loss-making and barely making meaningful returns.

I was able to get hold of his spreadsheet recently to properly review his financial situation and it's extremely alarming. From my analysis, he's holding:

* 70+ individual stocks, mostly losses
* 10+ mutual funds, mostly losses

Over the last 10 months, I've created and presented two separate presentations explaining the amount of risk he's taking. I've explained the urgency of trimming his portfolio massively and reallocating into a simple index funds / bonds and even blue-chip individual stocks instead of penny stocks.

However, he has massive sunk-cost fallacy and refuses to cut his positions. He wants to wait another 6 months despite having held some of these positions over a decade. This is despite me presenting the mathematical projections that he's almost guaranteed to continue incurring huge losses holding these duds over investing in safer assets.

Does anyone have advice? I'm appaled as to how bad the damage is and whether he'll be able to repay the loan given his age.

TLDR;

Dad lost most of retirement savings from risky assets, has a $1.6 million loan to repay.",252,243,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nhozun/how_do_i_27m_convince_my_dad_68m_to_stop_gambling/,month,Unknown,0.78

**Bad news is bad news:** Yes, the 10 year rallied from 4.17% to close at 4.08%, boosting the S&P 500 from the day's low, but weak jobs report confirms a 4 month trend of a softening labor market, it's not a flash in a pan. Further, I don’t see any catalysts for this trend reversing. The average four month payroll growth is now just 25,000, as compared to 185,000 in the same period last year, and 186,000 in 2024. And excluding the pandemic, this is the weakest monthly job creation since 2010. 

**A reliable job sector is showing weakness:** Worse, job creation in non cyclical sectors such as elder care, healthcare, government and municipal services has slowed signifying real barriers to employment growth. Healthcare jobs have always been the growth engine and a reliable one in an aging population, thus the slowdown in this sector is foreboding. Employment in health care and social assistance rose by about 47,000 in August. That’s the smallest monthly increase since January 2022. It’s arguably a big warning sign for the wider labor market given the sector has accounted for more than 40% of all new jobs over the last three years. 

**Non-Farm payrolls was not the only sign** – The JOLTS report showed slowdowns in job openings, unemployment claims have gone up and continuing claims remain high indicating that its getting tougher to find jobs.

**What can the rate cuts do and not do?**

It helps lower the 10-year treasury yield as we saw on Friday, which in turn will reduce mortgage rates and commercial business rates.

It will help housing the most, and ease financial conditions for commercial construction and business, but this will take time to filter through.

It does not directly help job creation

It will inflate assets, especially stocks, which is dangerous.

**Avoid the FOMO and BTD impulses:** Don’t jump in because the Fed will cut in September – that’s already priced in. The Fed will cut rates of at least 25 basis points, possibly 50 at the September 17 meeting, but cuts will take time to impact growth. **What’s not priced in is a weakening economy and a much needed correction in an expensive market.** Don’t chase the rally just on lower interest rates, instead understand that a weak labor market can nudge the country into a recession. To be sure, there has never been a recession with unemployment rates below 6%, and at 4.4% there are no alarm bells, but we’re trudging in the wrong direction. Trade policy uncertainties, AI productivity improvements and DOGE cuts are taking their toll on the economy.

1nvbe1f,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 11:30:39,Amazon launches ‘price-conscious’ grocery brand with most products under $5,"Amazon on Wednesday expanded its private-label grocery lineup with the launch of a new brand aimed at “price-conscious” shoppers, with most products priced under $5.

The brand is called Amazon Grocery and includes more than 1,000 items, ranging from dairy, fresh produce, meat and seafood to snacks and baking essentials, the company said in a release. Amazon said the new offering unites its Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh brands under one label.

“During a time when consumers are particularly price-conscious, Amazon Grocery delivers more than 1,000 quality grocery items across all categories that don’t compromise on quality or taste – from fresh food items to crave-worthy snacks and pantry essentials – all at low, competitive prices that help customers stretch their grocery budgets further,” Jason Buechel, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide grocery, said in a statement.

It’s not the first time Amazon has experimented with a budget-friendly grocery brand. It launched a similar offering last September, called Amazon Saver, that was “focused on value.”

The move comes as Amazon’s grocery business has been in flux.

The company has continued to streamline its chain of Go cashierless convenience stores and Fresh supermarkets, announcing last week that it will close all of its locations in the U.K.

At the same time, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and other company executives have touted the success of sales of “everyday essentials” within its online grocery business, which refers to items such as canned goods, paper towels, dish soap and snacks.

The company last month expanded same-day delivery of fresh foods to more pockets of the U.S. as it looks to encourage shoppers to add meat and eggs to their order while they’re browsing its sprawling online store.

How can a political wound be healed with something as mild as cold medicine?

I honestly don’t understand why some people think that stimulating the economy alone will make companies hire workers.

Or rather, they think the Fed can’t tell what’s causing the slowdown in jobs and will eventually cut rates mindlessly.

Look at the manufacturing sector, the biggest victim of tariffs. Not only have tariffs failed to help them recover, but high raw material prices have also destroyed their competitiveness. Is this something that cutting interest rates can fix? Sigh.

It would also give Musk increased voting power over the EV maker and aspiring robotics titan, which he has publicly demanded since early 2024.

1nvw7lt,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 02:23:31,How do you see the whole AI bubble playing out?,"OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. are entrenched in Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, Oracle, Dell, whatever. They are significantly driving up the cloud revenue of these companies, which in turn buy from Nvidia. Investors keep pouring billions into the AI companies, which keep engaging in price wars with each other and spend whatever little they have left on R&D and paying absurdly high salaries in the name of superintelligence.

When, not if,  this bubble bursts and investor funding dries up for the unprofitable companies, what the hell happens? Call me naive but I just don't see a world where chatgpt doesn't exist anymore or one where people use less AI in the future. Even though the LLM companies are not ideal investments, their products are ridiculously good and it is no secret that all the corporations in the world, say in 10 years, will have significantly higher automation than it does today.

My guess is that these big ones (example OpenAI) are almost too big to fail. If there are concerns about liquidity Sundar or Satya or Zuck would probably swoop in to strike a deal with them. Given this assessment and the idea that the world tomorrow would use more AI than it does today, probably a good idea to invest in something like Dell I think, which is currently at a P/OCF of 13 and pouring large amounts into making data centers. In the alternative that some of these big ones fail, I still think there would be someone else to fill the gap and data center companies would stay afloat.

1nf4f8o,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 10:15:51,Is $ORCL secretly SoftBank in a mask?,"Let me get this straight:

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?

Lyft “will provide end-to-end fleet management services including vehicle readiness and maintenance, infrastructure, and depot operations in Nashville,” for the Waymo fleet, the companies said.

Waymo, which is owned by Alphabet, has taken a big lead in the U.S. robotaxi market, launching in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well as Austin and Atlanta.

2. Don't trade based on emotions. More recently, I sold a position because I knew it was overvalued. When it gained another 15%, I panicked with a serious case of fear of missing out and jumped back in. Two weeks later, the stock dropped by 50%. Trust your analysis, not your feelings.

Yes, if you bought during or before 2021 you likely are still down. However, if you held your nose and bought when it was trading at dirt cheap prices during Feb 2024 you’re probably pretty happy right now.

The best time to buy is when everyone says “this is Uninvestable.” For example, I think stocks like MOH and CNC could have a lot of upside, maybe some REITs like ARE or MPW have value too. 

And yes, I am well aware of the VIE structure of the BABA ADR. It is certainly a risk, but all investing comes with risk, you just need to ensure that you’re well compensated for the risk you’re taking.

1nq6s8e,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 09:28:39,Intel jumps 8%… while Marvell spends $5B on buybacks,"This morning while scrolling through Bitget’s RWA perpetual futures index, I stumbled on something I honestly didn’t expect: **Intel pumping +8%** and Marvell announcing a $5 billion share buyback. I wasn’t expecting to see these two “old guards” of semiconductors shaking the market at the same time.

For Intel, the rally came from a mix of catalysts lining up. Micron’s strong earnings gave confidence back to the sector, and Intel raised its outlook for 2025. With around 76% market share in x86, they’re better positioned than many thought. Digging deeper, I saw they’re preparing the Panther Lake (18A) launch for late 2025, getting US government and SoftBank support for their AI/foundry ambitions, and placing large orders with ASML for the next-gen High-NA EUV machines. They even announced an AI partnership with Trust Stamp, focusing on biometrics and privacy. No surprise analysts bumped the price target up to $43 with a buy rating.

Marvell, on the other hand, is playing a different card: a massive $5 billion buyback, including a $1B accelerated program with $300M already executed this quarter. Instead of betting on a future product or tech breakthrough, they’re giving back directly to shareholders to boost confidence in the near term.

What struck me is the contrast. Intel is trying to rewrite its future by going all-in on AI and foundry, while Marvell is choosing immediate stability. Two very different visions in the same sector, but both managed to move the market big time at the same moment.

What do you think? Can Intel really reinvent itself for the long run, or is this just a short-term rebound?",145,119,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nq6s8e/intel_jumps_8_while_marvell_spends_5b_on_buybacks/,month,Company Discussion,0.95
1nn8wd5,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 20:59:38,The reason I’m shorting Harley-Davidson (HOG),"I decided to buy the $23, 1/15/27 puts for Harley-Davidson. I’ve been doing some research and have come to the conclusion that this would make a good short:

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley’s are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley’s. When economic conditions are rough, there’s not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn’t be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been sharply declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is “motorcycles are dangerous”.

Everybody is saying the same things about it. The CEO sucks, they have flopped many products, they can't monetize in the way that other social media giants can. But the reason I believe it's a good purchase: It’s survived wave after wave of “this app is dead” & still the userbase is growing year after year.

Snapchat is growing year-over-year, with a 7% increase in global monthly active users (MAU) to 932 million and a 9% increase in daily active users (DAU) to 469 million in Q2 2025.

This makes it very interesting for acquisitions by e.g. Meta or Google - or simply a complete overhaul of the monetization done by money hungry consultancy firms such as Mckinsey or Deloitte.

Besides, they currently already have increased profit quarter after quarter. They could even keep improving with the current set-up.

And the cherry on top: it's currently trading at an all time low.

It has the potential to grow slowly in the current states, but it could also increase exponentially with exciting developments in the future.

Should you allocate 50% of your portfolio? No. But a small position can't hurt, in my opinion.

1nl1f0l,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 07:50:52,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",114,56,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,month,Industry Discussion,0.89

The U.S. grid is already strained, gas turbines are sold out through 2028, nuclear is slow to deploy, and renewables are tied up in political roadblocks.”


I check this sub (and other stock ones) a fair amount but I always see one common theme: nuclear. The main concern there is how long it takes for those power plants to build. We can’t wait a decade.

A quick question: out of the Mag 7, which do you think have the largest and lowest downside potential in case AI does not turn out to be the goldmine many think/thought it could be?

There are increasing concerns around the current version of AI (LLMs) being limited and not able to reach AGI (see, for instance, Yann Lecun’s take on it), coupled with concerns around monetisation (or, at least, monetisation in a scale compatible with providing good returns on the huge capital being invested), hence my question.

I think Nvidia is the top loser in that scenario, and Tesla the least exposed. Not sure about the other ones.

1nnk82c,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 07:45:38,Why Japanese Real Estate Small Caps Might Be the Best Value in Global Markets Right Now,"The Japanese stock market has finally climbed back to the highs it set during one of the largest financial bubbles in history (the 1980s). After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

⸻

Bottom line:
Japanese real estate small caps are a rare mix of hyper-growth, low valuations, insider ownership, and secular tailwinds.

*Oklo Inc today holds a groundbreaking ceremony at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for its first Aurora powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”*

*“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.*

*The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.*

*“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”*",82,45,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1no03ff/oklo_breaks_ground_on_first_aurora_powerhouse/,month,Company News,0.91

Now, the company wants a second win.

Starting on Monday, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema will hear arguments in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on how to fix Google’s monopoly over some online advertising technology. The judge ruled this year that Google had broken the law to protect its dominance over the largely invisible system of technology that places ads on pages across the web. The hearing is expected to last for two to three weeks.

The Justice Department has said it wants Google to sell the technology it uses to connect buyers and sellers of ad space, among other potential remedies. Google has instead proposed measures including changing its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers.

Judge Brinkema’s ultimate decision could disrupt the company’s $3.1 trillion business and help rewrite the playbook for tech dominance in the modern internet era.

1ne09jg,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 01:10:39,"$BYRN DD: It's Mispriced, and I think it'll pop by October 8th. I'll prove it.","**TL;DR: I believe $BYRN will pop off on or before their earnings call on October 8th.** Shorts are trying to convince you that a company with 57% revenue growth and frankly explosive profits is a bad bet. They are wrong.


    Standard play: $BYRN shares currently $19-20;
    
    Budget play 1: 10/17 25c currently ~$0.65;
    
    Budget play 2: 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80. 


\---------------------------------------------------

In 2023, I started value investing again. Responsibly. Just a bit. And long story short, I found BYRN. I've been holding it since it was $4. After their 2025 first quarter earnings, they spiked to around $34, where I took profits. But then the stock sank. And sank some more. For no reason. So I bought back. And so should you.

Disclaimer: I couldn't post this in WSB because BYRN is at $475mm market cap and doesn't meet the $500mm minimum requirement. Hopefully tomorrow I can post there too.

---
- *Quick rundown of Byrna.  It's a nonlethal gun (""launcher"") company that gained attention after Google banned them from advertising on their platforms in 2023 for promoting violence. Ironic. Police departments worldwide are using it now, and the Streisand effect is gaining them more and more contracts. Their CMRO is genuinely goated, most recently securing a deal with Sportsman's Warehouse to have in-store Byrna demo rooms. It's been a massive success, as you'll see below. They have*  ***zero debt and positive income***.

---

Seriously though, there's like literally no reason it's being suppressed at $20. I have reason to believe there's some bullshittery happening here. Here I shall present to you my thesis on their October 8th earnings call. Fun fact, I typed this entire thing myself. No AI.

So you're doubtful? Nah bruh. LOOK at the

###Fundamentals:

**Tariff resistance stats:** 100% ammo production in the USA. 92% launcher production in the USA.

**Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $26.2 million (57% increase from $16.7 million)
    Gross Profit: $15.9 million (61% of revenue)
    Net Income: $1.7 million (9900% increase from $17,000)

**Q2 2025 vs. Q2 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $28.5 million (41% increase from $20.3 million)
    Gross Profit: $17.6 million (62% of revenue)
    Net Income: $2.4 million (14% increase from $2.1 million)


**Q3 2025 vs. Q3 2024 (Preliminary)**:

    Net Revenue: $28.2 million (35% increase from $20.9 million)
     - Driven by a 147% increase in chain store and dealer channels (wtf)
    Web sales increased by 8%.
    International sales grew by 33%.

Like please. In one of the most turbulent economic chapters in US history, BYRN is STILL ramping its sales and margins. And yet, the stock is hovering around $20. My best guess is, your average retail investor isn't who is shorting it. It's someone else. Possibly a hedge fund, because 66% of BYRN is owned by institutional investors who don't give enough of a shit to short it.

I've been tracking this stock for 2 years now. People are catching on. Remember, these guys were trading at $4 in 2023. Every single one of their C level execs is amazing. Analyst price targets are between $35 and $46. The company is officially profitable, and income is consistently in the black. But the stock is marooned at $20. I couldn't make sense of it, because I don't like conspiracy theories. But it kept happening. For MONTHS.

###The Short ""Interest""

Yeah, we're a bit allergic to the term ""shorts"" these days. I get it. But... I have to call it out. Because as of August 15th, the short interest on BYRN was 4.08 million shares, or 23.1% of the total float. ***Nearly a quarter of the company’s publicly traded shares are being shorted.***

##***23.1% short interest on a profitable, zero debt company.*** WHAT.

> **They use AI in their marketing...**

- The target market for the AI ads are boomers who shop at Sportsman’s Warehouse. They can’t tell the difference between AI and a real video, and they don’t care. I literally sent my parents the video and asked them what was wrong with it. My mom said ""it was a wonderful ad, very clever"". Bullish.

> **The economy is uncertain...**

- BYRN is nearly immune to tariffs. See Tariff Resist Stats above. The fact that the stock moves on tariff news is honestly dumb as heck, but we live in the world of algos now. Bullish, but also I'm a bit pissed about this.

> **They're burning cash...**

- Yep. New product release (Byrna CL), they're burning cash to stockpile and advertise it. And they're still in the black. AND it’s working. Gotta spend money to make money. Bullish.


The preliminary earnings for Q3 are already out, and they are fantastic. The only thing left to be revealed in October is the EPS, and I’m betting 30k shares that it’s going to be another profitable quarter.

Why am I writing this all out? Because I want someone else other than me to be interested in this. BYRN is an obviously overlooked company. I rode the wave from $4 without saying a word and waiting for talking heads from Yahoo.com to spread the news. But lately I've been thinking, there's a big value play here, and it's happening because somebody with a lot of money somewhere made a mistake and needs time to unload. I'm expecting it to run up to somewhere from $35-$45. Am I crazy? Can someone stop me because I want to throw 100% of my portfolio into this baddie. I'm actually simping for this company so hard its crazy.

###Plays to take advantage of this (I did all 3):

1. 10/17 25c currently ~$0.60-$0.90

2. Buy the stock. Currently hovering between $19-$21

3. 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80 (less risky play)

CEO Adam Goldstein called it a *“landmark moment,”* while United’s CFO said flying taxis could reshape how people move through congested cities. The trials could start as early as next year, with data feeding into certification and future expansion.

ACHR has already had a wild run this year (up over 150% YoY), but this adds another layer of federal legitimacy. Analysts keep slapping buy ratings with $13 PTs, even after the stock’s volatility.

The Cupertino company has moved staff from working on its new, lighter and cheaper Vision Pro to focus on its smart glasses, which would be similar to those offered by Meta Platforms, the report said, citing people close to the issue. Apple engineers are working on at least two types of the smart glasses. One is being crafted to be paired with an iPhone and will lack its own display. This could be revealed as soon as 2026. The other version will contain a display similar to the recently released Meta Ray-Ban Display.

Apple's smart glasses are expected to utilize voice interaction and AI capabilities, the report said. It would also rely on an upgraded Siri, which is projected for a March release at the earliest. They would also feature a much lower price tag than the Vision Pro, which started at $3,499.

Meta released its Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses on Tuesday, Sept. 30. They start at $799 and feature the Meta Neural Band.

1. Uber just invested 300 million dollars to partner with Lucid on a 20,000 unit robotaxi fleet built on the Gravity SUV platform. This is a huge validation of both Gravity and Lucid’s tech, with the first launch planned in the US next year
2. Saudi PIF backing is still solid which means financial support is not going away
3. The Gravity SUV launch on the consumer side adds another growth angle beyond the Air sedan
4. EV names often move together. Any rally in Tesla, Rivian or the sector can give Lucid a sympathy lift
5. Cost cutting has started to show up in the financials and management is working on margins
6. The reverse split has already played out and most weak holders are gone which reduces negative sentiment
7. Lucid is no longer trading like a penny stock which means bigger institutions can step in
8. Central bank policy leaning more dovish supports high growth names like Lucid by lowering funding pressure

Lucid still has risks with burn and execution but Uber’s endorsement adds credibility and institutions may look at the stock differently now.

1nd1djr,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 21:37:26,Nebius Moves To The Big Leagues,"**The $17.4Bn to $19.4Bn Nebius - Microsoft Deal**

NBIS ($96)

**This is a tremendous deal for Nebius.**

My investment thesis for Nebius was based on its technical/engineering strengths as a medium sized Neocloud provider democratizing AI infrastructure for medium sized businesses who did not want or need to pay exorbitant fees to AWS or the other hyperscalers. Prior to this deal, its biggest customer was Shopify and it was well on its way to expanding its reach to companies at, or below Shopify’s size.

**Nebius' competitive advantages:** Its biggest strengths lie in its full software stack, honed by decades of engineering talent from the ex Yandex team, instead of being a brute provider of GPU‘s in scale like Coreweave, which meant that it had the competitive advantage of not being sucked into lower pricing from just renting out GPUs. It could command a higher price and margin than other Neocloud providers, by focusing more on providing a platform and a superior stack of solutions, plus its customers were supposed to be smaller, giving it more bargaining power. Its second competitive advantage is its strategic relationship with Nvidia, which allows it to commit and guarantee computing power, the way it did with Microsoft. It has the GPUs and the datacenter infrastructure to ensure that there are no supply constraints or bottlenecks.

**Excellent Return On Investment**: Prior to this deal, its estimated sales growth was $0.6Bn in 2025, growing to $9Bn by 2030, and my target was 8X sales or a market cap of $72Bn, which was about 5x the market cap of $15Bn it was selling at till yesterday - so an almost 5x return over 5 years or 37% per year. **Pretty hefty.**

**Even better ROI:** A deal of $18Bn at mid-point clearly changes these estimates and I’m conservatively forecasting the six year deal adds at least $2Bn to revenue each year. And of course, they will get growth from other clients, a massive deal like this gives them even more cachet - my revised sales target for 2030 is $13.5Bn, valuing Nebius at 10x sales = $135Bn. CEO, Arkady Volozh calls this just the beginning, and so far he has walked the talk. At $135Bn we could be looking at almost 7x the current market cap of $22.6Bn (at a price of$95), or a return of 42% per year.

**Need to raise capital:** They will need to raise at least $3-5Bn in the next 2-3 years from both debt and equity, to play in the majors, but what’s also amazing is that they are financing this with Microsoft’s cash and credit, which means the dilution/interest payments will not be that high. Nebius still comes out way ahead with another 30% increase in share count, if needed at this price. Coreweave has $7.5 billion in long-term debt with about $7 billion in sales in 2025 with around $30 billion worth of contracts, and their growth trajectory confirms that capital raises are absolutely necessary for Neoclouds to thrive. 

**Adding more shares:** I was very content to hold and even sold off some in the mid-sixties after getting 2.6x my purchase price of $23, but now I think the stock is still worth buying even though it has shot up 45% in a day, considering where this company could go in the next five years. This deal actually validates my original thesis and I have no qualms about pyramiding (adding smaller quantities) to my holding.  
**To be sure, this increases the risks and challenges, namely execution, reduction in AI demand, enhanced competition, and dilution, but I think the risks are worth it.**",61,27,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nd1djr/nebius_moves_to_the_big_leagues/,month,Company Discussion,0.87

Sure I’ve missed so many things there as all the many divisions of Rolls-Royce seems to be on turbo charge at the moment.

With aviation demand rising (and especially from Airbus more than Boeing),  with defence spending rising, and with the growing and desperate need for more sustainable energy solutions from nuclear, etc etc, it is inevitable that Rolls-Royce will be announcing more deals on all fronts in the coming weeks and months.

1n92hmm,2025-09-05,2025-09-05 07:18:21,ACHR Discussion: Can eVTOLs Ever Be Profitable?,"Greetings,

Archer Aviation (ACHR) has been on my radar as one of the more ambitious names in the emerging eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) space. With the stock now trading under $10, it’s worth taking a closer look from a value perspective.

**The Bear Case: Heavy Cash Burn and Dilution**

**Massive Cash Burn:** Archer is losing ~$500M in free cash flow annually. Scaling aircraft manufacturing is extremely capital intensive & it may be years before the company can generate positive cash flow

**Dilution Risk:** Shares outstanding are up more than 50% YoY as the company raised $850M last quarter. This shareholder dilution could continue as Archer funds its manufacturing buildout.

**Execution Risk:** To cover its expenses, Archer would need to deliver 300+ Midnight aircraft annually, far above the 50 planned in the near term. Any delays in certification or ramp up could extend losses and erode investor confidence.


**The Bull Case: Strategic Backers and Market Potential**

**Strong Investors:** Boeing, United Airlines, Stellantis, and ARK Invest are all backing Archer. This validation from major aviation players gives credibility to its long-term vision.

**Cash Runway:** With $1.7B on the balance sheet, Archer has several years of runway to prove itself, even at the current burn rate.

**Commercial Opportunities:** Initial deliveries to Abu Dhabi Aviation, plans for taxi routes at the LA 2028 Olympics, and potential defense contracts with Anduril offer multiple paths to revenue.

**Urban Mobility Moat:** If eVTOL becomes mainstream, Archer could benefit from first-mover advantage in building networks in cities where time savings (10min flights vs. hour long drives) have clear value

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/time-to-buy-the-dip-on-archer-aviation-stock-below-10/ar-AA1LR8n0?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds

**My Take:**
At under $10, Archer offers exposure to a potentially transformative technology but comes with serious risks. The high burn rate and reliance on capital raises make it vulnerable, yet the backing of large industry players and its international traction provide a real (though speculative) upside case

For me, this falls into the optionality bucket it could be a multi bagger if execution goes right or a value trap if certification drags and dilution continues

**Questions for the community:**

-Do you believe Archer can realistically ramp from 50 aircraft per year to 300+ within a decade?

-How do you handicap the probability of FAA approval by 2028?

-Would you treat ACHR as a venture style bet/ does the dilution risk outweigh the upside?

1nntg89,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 13:51:36,"In a low rates environment, nearly all equities are winners. Why stocks only go up. (For now).","It feels like, no matter the bad news, equities just keep climbing. Here’s the(my) reasoning as to why this is happening and why it'll likely continue.

First, let’s state the obvious: we’re not in a low-rate environment right now. However there are some things happening that are leading to one. Regardless of your views of the current U.S. president, he’s been pushing Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. So far, Powell has remained focused on the economic data and stayed independent in his decision-making. However, Powell’s term ends in about eight months (May 15, 2026). Once that happens, it seems almost inevitable that Trump will try to appoint someone more in line with his agenda, someone who will likely push for rate cuts until his target rate of around 1.5% is reached (this seems to be the consensus, though I’ve seen various estimates).

If/when that happens, I expect markets to take off for the foreseeable future. Why? Because lower rates mean cheaper borrowing. A simple(although flawed as mortgage loans are amortized amongst other things) example:

A $500K home at 2% interest would cost roughly $665K over 30 years (assuming no early payments).

A $500K home at 6% interest would cost $1.1 million over the same period.

This is basic economics, lower interest rates increase borrowing power, which lets companies expand faster and take on more risk.

Does this mean we’re heading for another major recession or depression eventually? Probably. But that timing is much harder to predict than the markets’ current expectation that a low-rate environment is coming.",55,30,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nntg89/in_a_low_rates_environment_nearly_all_equities/,month,Broad market news,0.79

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story. 

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

1nes68a,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 22:57:35,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don’t make money, they burn money, so it’s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it’s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it’s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm’s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it’s going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won’t be pretty. The warning signs are already showing.

1nksav5,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 23:00:45,UPS Has A Limited Downside From This Price,"United Parcel Service (UPS) $85

**Industry/Sector/Type –  – – Transportation/Goods/Cyclical** 

Biggest catalyst for the stock – High dividend yield and low valuation, scraping the bottom of the barrel for “value” stocks. Cautious buy, expecting a limited downside.

**Positives**

**Low Valuation:** United Parcel Service trades at a decade-low valuation of 12x earnings, which doesn’t give enough credit to its pivot from low-margin Amazon volumes towards higher-value customers. I believe that in a few years, UPS should improve operating margins significantly from the current 9% to about 12% with better paying customers.

**Healthcare logistics market:** The healthcare logistics market is estimated to grow at 9-10% to $82Bn, and UPS has plans to double revenues from this segment to $20Bn by 2026. This is a significantly higher valued market with a lot of specialized functions - storage, handling, and time-sensitive transportation, essential when you're delivering medicine, biologics, and medical devices. The $87Bn UPS has a competitive advantage over smaller carries, because it has a lot of infrastructure in place - such as temperature-controlled storage in several locations to cater this industry from clinical trials to patient deliveries. The best part of course, premium pricing. 

**Cost cutting and operational improvements:**  Here are the key points of UPS $3.5B cost reduction program:

* Reducing 20,000 jobs in 2025, across operations and management, with voluntary buyouts.
* Closing 73 facilities as part of a broader consolidation.
* Automating 64% of operations.
* 35% of reductions will come from operational roles, and 30% from Capex.
* Consolidating package routes.
* Raising revenue per piece by dropping less-profitable customers and increasing rates on retained volume

**Negatives**

**Under performer** – In the past decade the stock has lost 14%, with a very high percentage of Amazon’s business, which hurt margins. It has fallen significantly off a high of $203 from 2022. 

**Lack of forward guidance** – turnaround efforts have flattered to only deceive, two recent examples, it pulled its 2025 revenue and profit outlook in April and again withheld from providing targets in July. 

**Tariff uncertainty**  – the US-China trade being a key contributor to the lack of clarity. The demise of the de minimis exclusion of merchandise below $800 from tariffs is hurting UPS.

**Valuation**

After 15% and 4% earnings and revenues drops in 2025, I do expect UPS to return to 10-11% earnings growth and 2-4% revenue growth for the next 3 years.

A market cap of just $71Bn against $87Bn in sales is attractive. Add to that a historically low P/E of 12, and a dividend yield of 7.5%,

**High yield** – its dividend yield of 7.5% looks safe for now. **This a cautious buy.** The only caveat is that we still have a lot of trade uncertainty, and if the turnaround takes longer, this could fall even further, but I believe the downside is limited from here.

* **IEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Focuses on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 7 and 10 years. It provides a middle ground between the low risk of short-term bonds and the high volatility of long-term bonds
* **TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Concentrates on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities over 20 years. This gives it a high duration, meaning it is highly sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates.
* **GOVT (iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF):** Provides exposure to the entire U.S. Treasury yield curve, from short- to long-term. Its blended maturity profile reduces volatility compared to a long-duration fund like TLT but also limits its upside if long rates fall.
* **GOVZ (iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF):** The most aggressive option, holding zero-coupon STRIPS. Its long duration makes it extremely sensitive to interest rate changes. It is a high-risk investment and not typically for investors seeking broad Treasury exposure.

1nxu9bk,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 09:38:58,Portfolio discussion; Speculative vs blue chip etc.,"Hello all! At 39, it’s a bit sad that I’ve only recently gotten into the stock market. I have a 401k that is managed and not large.

But I also hold some money in Roth, and have some money coming into my traditional Ira soon, like this week. My Roth holds voo, schd, and a tiny amount of Amazon and meta. Don’t ask me why I started that way.

I’ve watched many videos on building a diversified portfolio and using ETFs like voo or schd for growth with moderate risk.

But I don’t feel I understand enough to invest the amount I have coming in and don’t want to lose out.

I understand to place stable and dividend paying stocks into traditional and high growth stocks into Roth. Is it that simple? Does anyone chase speculative stocks? How diverse should I be? When I think about gold, reits, and global stocks, I get scared honestly. It feels overwhelming as I like things simple and straight forward and am not familiar with those assets.

Is this post isn’t allowed, I apologize. But my goal is to have a dialogue and meet some like minded investors. I can watch YouTube videos all day long, but sometimes it helps to discuss with others.

And there seems to be internal reluctancy at making big moves with this cash, even in a period where inter-multinational investments are hot and rampant, even bordering on incestuous. Since the market is generally at ATH, these reciprocal movements make sense as everyone is boosting everyone else's value. But BRK.B is just watching from the sidelines. 

Why?

I suspect even the smartest investors of the firm realize one simple fact: Buffet is about to die, and the news will be on everyone's face, causing a knee jerk reaction along the lines of ""He was irreplacable, the firm will stop making significant gains until true new leadership emerges"".

Which is clearly not true. But humans are spooked easily and many don't know he does not even actively manage the firm anymore.

1nxidln,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 22:34:33,Reddit (RDDT) - Everyone’s Missing What Actually Happened,"
Position: Long 1 contract, Jan 2026 $210 Call (+$362.50)

TL;DR: The 7% drop from “ChatGPT citations declining” is the most misunderstood selloff I’ve seen this year. Google just handed Reddit pricing power on a silver platter.

-----

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED:

Sept 10: Google kills num=100 parameter
→ Search APIs can only pull 10-20 results instead of 100
→ Reddit content (ranked 11-100) disappears from scraped data
→ ChatGPT citations drop from 14% to 2%
→ Stock tanks from $240 to $207

Wall Street sees: “Reddit losing AI relevance”

I see: “Reddit just got monopoly pricing on their content”

-----

THE SETUP EVERYONE’S MISSING:

Before: OpenAI scraped Reddit for free via Google

After: OpenAI must pay Reddit directly for API access

This isn’t Reddit losing value. This is Google eliminating Reddit’s free rider problem.

THE MATH:

Current confirmed deals:

- Google: $60M/year
- OpenAI: ~$60M/year
- Total AI licensing run rate: $200M+

They’re negotiating “dynamic pricing” = pay per use

If usage drives pricing and free access just got killed, what happens to those numbers?

Do the math. It’s not going down.

-----

THE CITATION DROP ACTUALLY PROVES THE THESIS:

Stock moved 14% on an 86% citation drop.

Think about that.

One metric from one AI platform moved a $30B company 14%.

That’s not weakness. That’s dependency.

ChatGPT can’t function without Reddit’s UGC. Neither can Perplexity. Neither can Google’s AI.

They just lost free access.

Now they pay, or their AI gets dumber.

-----

WHY REDDIT WINS THIS:

1. Content moat nobody can replicate

- 100M daily users having real conversations
- Every niche topic covered
- Continuously updated
- 18 years of archived knowledge

1. Q2 fundamentals crushed it

- $501M revenue (+84% YoY)
- Just turned profitable
- 97M DAU (+51% YoY)
- Positive free cash flow

1. AI companies have no alternatives

- Stack Overflow? Smaller, tech-only
- Quora? Dead
- Discord? Private, not indexed
- Twitter? Toxic wasteland
- Where else do you get quality UGC at scale?

1. Google just eliminated their competition

- Can’t scrape Reddit via Google anymore
- Must use Reddit’s direct API
- Reddit sets the price

-----

THE BEAR CASE (because I’m not an idiot):

- Negotiations could fail
- OpenAI might reduce Reddit dependency
- Valuation still rich at 8x sales
- User experience degrading from over-monetization
- Competition could emerge

These are real risks. I’m not ignoring them.

But the risk/reward at $207 after a panic sell on misunderstood news?

That’s the setup I want.

-----

WHAT I’M WATCHING:

Bullish catalysts:

- New OpenAI deal announced (higher rates)
- Q3 earnings showing AI revenue acceleration
- Additional platform partnerships
- Dynamic pricing implementation

Bearish catalysts:

- Failed negotiations
- User growth slowdown
- Continued citation decline without revenue growth
- Management fumbling this opportunity

-----

MY ACTUAL THESIS:

The market saw “citations down” and panic sold.

Smart money should see “free access eliminated, paid access mandatory.”

Google didn’t hurt Reddit. Google just forced every AI company to negotiate directly with Reddit.

And Reddit owns content nobody else has.

That’s pricing power.

The Jan 2026 $210 call gives me:

- 3 months to see Q3 earnings
- Time for new deal announcements
- Exposure to re-rating if market figures this out
- Limited downside (premium paid)

This is 2% of my portfolio. High conviction on thesis, sized appropriately for execution risk.

-----

What am I missing? Where’s the hole in this logic?

Genuinely want to stress test this before adding to the position.

Not financial advice. I own calls. Do your own research.

Insider activity between September 12 and 15 showed seven transactions totaling about $1.52M, with 79% of that value from sales. While that kind of selling can bring short-term pressure, it is often part of normal liquidity behavior for a company scaling at this stage. Against giants like $MSFT and $IBM, $QBTS is differentiating itself by pushing harder on commercialization. With the capital raise complete and adoption trends picking up, 2025 may be the year it proves whether it can hold ground in the broader quantum race.

Commercial traction is becoming clearer too, with bookings in Asia Pacific up 83%. Analysts are pointing to the stronger balance sheet and expanding customer adoption as reasons the outlook looks favorable. I actually made an entry on bitget to test the momentum but decided to exit for now and take more time to study the fundamentals before leaning in further.

Curious to hear how others on this sub are reading the company’s moves. Does the raise, NASA tie-in, and growth in bookings look like the right setup for long-term strength, or do you think the insider selling signals caution?

> The U.S. dollar ended the first half of 2025 with its biggest loss since 1973. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies of the U.S.’s major trading partners, fell about 11% from January through the end of June.

> Elon Musk this week urged his followers to cancel their Netflix  subscriptions over a controversy surrounding an animated show and its creator. Musk on Wednesday posted on his X platform saying, “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids.” The post was in response to an image accusing Netflix of carrying out a “transgender woke agenda.” The controversy seems to stem from conservative backlash over an animated Netflix show, “Dead End: Paranormal Park,” which features a transgender character. The show was canceled in 2023 after two seasons.

> In addition to several anti-trans posts, Musk also responded to a post criticizing alleged statements made by the show’s creator, Hamish Steele, that a prominent conservative X account said “mocked” the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Steele responded to Musk’s callout on rival social media platform Bluesky saying, “It’s probably going to be a very odd day.” Steele also shared a post by TV writer Jack Bernhardt that called “Dead End” a “brilliant show about kind, wonderful characters.” Also this week, vocal conservative activist Robby Starbuck began posting about Netflix, echoing anti-trans sentiments and arguing the company has promoted an ideology that is “hateful to White Americans.” Starbuck, who has repeatedly targeted major corporations in recent months over diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, said in one of his X posts on Netflix, “No one should give this woke company another dime.”

> Analysts say the backlash might not pose as big of a threat to Netflix as Musk may be hoping for.

While I understand than in this case the differences between both tickets are the voting rights and dividend payment, neither of them seem to have changed recently (that I’m aware of),  I don't seem to find a reason why in particular today, those prices are not correlated.

I've searched news about them. I appreciate any hints that help me to understand this.

Thank you!

EDIT: About 03:56:50 PM ET both tickets are both down about 2.35% which I would expect, both going on the same direction when there are no major events.

- “With S&P 500 near record highs, it's time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget it strategy, some experts say

Even amid a federal government shutdown, the S&P 500 climbed to a new all-time high on Thursday.

Yet investors who double down on that index risk overconcentration in big company names.

Here's how experts say to diversify to avoid those risks:

Experts say it may be time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget-it S&P

500-focused strategy, famously touted by legendary investor Warren Buffett.

""The S&P 500 is broken,"" said Michael DeMassa, who is a certified financial planner.

Many investors assume investing in the
S&P 500 index through ETF tickers SPY, VOO or IVV is synonymous with diversification, DeMassa said.

If you can invest in the S&P 500 index for a long time, you will probably do well, said Deva Panambur.

But occasionally the index suffers long periods of underperformance, he said. For example, between 2000 and 2008, the S&P 500 was down by more than 30%.
Wall Street forecasts generally see the index continuing to go up for the foreseeable future.
Still, experts say it's best to choose a broader investment mix in case there is a pullback.

Unlike S&P 500 index funds, total market funds also provide exposure to small- and mid-cap stocks in addition to large-cap companies.
Alternatively, investors may opt to broaden the exposure an S&P 500 index fund already provides in their portfolio. One example may be a fund that tracks a total market index that excludes S&P 500 index stocks.

That’s mostly all of it. I do want to set and forget it, I have about $27.k into the U.S ETF index and Canadian index split evenly. I’m up pretty good. Now sits at 30.8k. With a good amount of money in there now, this article just worried me. What you guys think, is this still the strategy ? Are they just fear mongering?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1. Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Our fundamental needs, at least in richer countries, are met for the most part. However, there is a crisis of purpose for many. Fitness can help fill that void.

2. The proliferation of Social Media. We've become inundated with photos and videos of what ""perfect"" bodies should look like. This has fostered a desire in people to try and achieve that for themselves.

3. GLP-1 drugs. Adoption of these drugs will rise rapidly in the years to come. With it will come a desire to ramp up exercise, in order to justify both the results that people are getting from these drugs and their high cost.

4. Protein centric marketing. Starbucks just added protein infused coffee to their menu. ""Protein"" really is the marketing buzzword of the day.

You always hear ""supply and demand"". And sure, that kinda makes sense. But I still don't really understand it. Who decides that the right price at this moment right now is X amount of dollars, based on those factors?

For example the real estate market is also driven by supply and demand. Still I can buy or sell a house at any imaginable price, if I find a buyer/seller. And chances are high the house won't go for the exact ""market value"". This is also possible with less unique items like cars, jewelry or electronics (or really anything). There may be an average price for bananas. But still every store won't be the same.

How is the price determined? I'd guess it's some algorithm.

Tesla just reported a massive milestone: **497,099 vehicles delivered in Q3**. That’s not just growth  it’s a record that shows how strong demand still is. Yet the stock dropped about –4% in the session, which makes me think the market is reacting more to sentiment and macro noise than to the fundamentals. Tesla remains polarizing: some call it the future of EVs, others still see a bubble.

But **NVIDIA** feels different. The stock popped **+3 to 4%** on news it will resume AI chip sales to China after the U.S. eased restrictions. That’s huge. Add to that the steady wave of institutional inflows, and it’s clear that big money is doubling down on AI. The narrative is powerful, the fundamentals are strong, and global demand is only accelerating.

As a trader, I see two clear paths:

* **Play Tesla short term**, with leverage for example through RWA Index Perpetual Futures  which let you trade tokenized stocks. I think platforms like Bitget offer that now.
* Or lean into NVIDIA long term, riding the unstoppable momentum around AI.

1. Don't put everything into one stock. When I first started in 2022, I put my entire savings into a single stock. It went bankrupt, and I lost everything. Diversifying your portfolio is a cliché for a reason.

2. Don't trade based on emotions. More recently, I sold a position because I knew it was overvalued. When it gained another 15%, I panicked with a serious case of fear of missing out and jumped back in. Two weeks later, the stock dropped by 50%. Trust your analysis, not your feelings.

I hope new investors read this and learn from our collective mistakes instead of making them on their own as I did. What are some of the biggest lessons you've learned the hard way and how?",205,115,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nwdpo6/confessions_of_a_rookie_investor_how_i_lost_big/,new,Advice,0.78

So I use high risk stocks to get my blood pumping. Plus or minus 5% dayly is my cup of tea. Currently in RKLB, SANA, NBIS (is Europe, I know), TEMP, RZLV, UUUU. Are there any likwise plays in Europe that you guys (m/f) like?

Edit: Not sure if you guys get a heads up if I edit, but hope so.

Wow, amazed by all the users that took their time to respond. Mucho gracias. I'll look into most of it (gonna leave aside the stocks people recommended that were already listed above :)

And to the two guys plugging options/leaps: tempting. I'm going to educate myself. In 2 years I went from a banking fund I had for years (looking back: sooo expensive), to etf's, to part etf and part individual safe stocks, to full port individual risky stuff. 60% up this year, but kind of easy: everything goes up. I think I'm going to learn the hard way, but I like the rollercoaster, and the bumpy ride.

Thanks again!

Here are the key numbers:

* Total deliveries Q3 2025: **497,099**
* Total production Q3 2025: **447,450**

The Elon Musk-led company was expected to report around 447,600 deliveries, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. In the same period a year ago, Tesla reported 462,890 deliveries and production of 469,796 vehicles.

An independent researcher who publishes as Troy Teslike on Patreon predicted 481,000 deliveries for the quarter. Tesla distributed a company-compiled consensus on Sept. 26, which said analysts were expecting 443,079 deliveries.

William Blair’s Jed Dorsheimer now projects 480,000 vehicles, up from 437,000 and well above Wall Street’s 443,000 consensus. The increase is tied to strong U.S. demand, a rebound in China, and a pull-forward of buyers ahead of expiring EV tax credits.  
  
At the same time, Elon Musk purchased $1 billion worth of Tesla stock and the company announced an expansion of its Robotaxi program. These developments have fueled renewed bullish sentiment around the stock.  
  
That said, not everything points up. Analysts caution that Q4 margins may face pressure as delivery growth slows and revenue from regulatory credits declines. Tesla also trades at a steep valuation, around 118× projected 2026 EBITDA, compared to the 20–25× range of most tech peers. Risks remain in the form of strong Chinese EV competition, Tesla’s reliance on China, and the “key-man risk” linked to Musk.  
  
Across Wall Street, Tesla holds a consensus “Hold” rating, with 15 Buys, 12 Holds, and 8 Sells, and an average target of $346.57 (around 22% downside from current levels).  
  
Position disclosure: I currently hold a TSLA futures position on Bitget. I took the trade after Musk’s share purchase and the Robotaxi expansion news, and it has been profitable so far.  
  
What strikes me is the tension here: on one hand, bullish catalysts like stronger deliveries, Musk’s buy, and the Robotaxi rollout; on the other, valuation risks and Q4 margin concerns.

They signed an MoU with RAKTA to basically be the sole partner for AV solutions there.

They’re positioning themselves as part of the regulatory and operational framework in UAE mobility.

He claims: “I haven't sold any of my CEO stock and intend never to in the future”. I decided to get through all the SEC Form 4 records and put them in a table so we all can make a judgment.

|2025-09-11|Sale|\-16,120|$47.05|$758,446.00|1,181,186|

Here is how I interpret the situation.

IONQ company:

* Current market cap: 20 billion 
* Has negative net income: -331m in 2024, -176m in Q2 2025
* Miserable gross revenue: 43m in 2024, 20m in Q2 2025
* The dilution is going crazy: Q1 2025 - 25m shares printed. Q2 2025 - 49m (almost $3billion from market cap in one quater) 

What I see in CEO actions:

* Appointed as CEO in 2025
* In Q1-Q2 of 2025 was awarded almost the same amount of $$$ in shares as the whole gross revenue of IONQ in 2024
* The dude goes public and says: “We are the next Nvidia”, “We will make billions in the future”.  
* Stock makes an insane 600%
* The new CEO sells most of his holdings from before 2025, yet in 2025, he gets a massive amount of new shares

What I think:

It is true, he did not sell any of his CEO stock. In fact, in 2025, while being CEO, he got more than a million new shares. I guess that he will get even more in 2025-2026. In this way, his number of shares and stake would remain the same as before 2025, but he managed to print more than 100 million $ in cash on quantum hype. 

This is more than the projected revenue of IONQ for 2025, which is between $82 million and $100 million (and remember, net is still negative) 

Quite a good deal.

They are significantly driving up the cloud revenue of these companies, which in turn buy from Nvidia. Investors keep pouring billions into the AI companies, which keep engaging in price wars with each other and spend whatever little they have left on R&D and paying absurdly high salaries in the name of superintelligence.

When, not if,  this bubble bursts and investor funding dries up for the unprofitable companies, what the hell happens? Call me naive but I just don't see a world where chatgpt doesn't exist anymore or one where people use less AI in the future. Even though the LLM companies are not ideal investments, their products are ridiculously good and it is no secret that all the corporations in the world, say in 10 years, will have significantly higher automation than it does today.

My guess is that these big ones (example OpenAI) are almost too big to fail. If there are concerns about liquidity Sundar or Satya or Zuck would probably swoop in to strike a deal with them. Given this assessment and the idea that the world tomorrow would use more AI than it does today, probably a good idea to invest in something like Dell I think, which is currently at a P/OCF of 13 and pouring large amounts into making data centers. In the alternative that some of these big ones fail, I still think there would be someone else to fill the gap and data center companies would stay afloat.

The Cupertino company has moved staff from working on its new, lighter and cheaper Vision Pro to focus on its smart glasses, which would be similar to those offered by Meta Platforms, the report said, citing people close to the issue.

The other version will contain a display similar to the recently released Meta Ray-Ban Display.

Apple's smart glasses are expected to utilize voice interaction and AI capabilities, the report said. It would also rely on an upgraded Siri, which is projected for a March release at the earliest. They would also feature a much lower price tag than the Vision Pro, which started at $3,499.

1nvo22s,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 19:29:27,IBM : the Nvidia of Quantum computing ?,"Hi everyone,

For a while now, I've been seeing a lot of people betting on quantum computers. I've noticed small companies whose stocks have gone up 10x in just a few months. Some are hoping to find the next gem that will lead this new world, which could be the next technological revolution.

Personally, I don't really understand this sector. I've been hearing about quantum computers for years, but it's true that the Nvidia wave, a simple graphics card company that became the world's largest market capitalization, to the point where a few thousand euros invested seven years ago would make you a millionaire today, has made people eager to bet on the next revolution.

I've done my own research on quantum computing, and when I listen to experts, it feels like it's still very far off, even though there's some ""experimental"" commercialization starting. These computers still make too many errors and don't meet the expected needs.

But in my research, one company keeps coming up when it comes to significant advancements in the sector: IBM. Yet, when I look at IBM's stock price, it's nowhere near the small-cap companies that have seen their stocks multiply by 10.

Today, I'm wondering if IBM, with its experience, technological advancements, and especially its financial resources, isn't the best-positioned company in this space.

However, I never see IBM mentioned in this sector. Worse, IBM is even excluded from sector-specific ETFs.

1nvg1dy,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 14:19:43,"Reminder - Tesla sales trending down, maybe unprofitable 3Q from no emissions credits, and taxi still has safety drivers - stock UP 30% Lol","The absurdity of Tesla knows no bounds. 

* Publicly available China sales data- which is about 35% of Tesla's sales - is still down 9% year over year, and Europe sales are still falling. American sales expect a bump due to loss of tax credits, but with Elon's alignment with Trump in the US generally hurting American sales, and significantly increased EV competition in the US, that bump is likely to be marginable at best. Accordingly, Tesla EV sales are still virtually guaranteed to be down year over year this quarter, stagnant at best. Remember, in 2020 Elon and Tesla bulls were projecting a ramp up to 20 million car sales per year (traditional EV sales, not robotaxi sales) by 2030. They've been stagnant - now decreasing - at under 2 million car sales for over a year now. 



* Worse still, the revenue from automotive regulatory credits will drop to zero starting this quarter, as emissions penalties were eliminated under the Trump administration. Notably, those emissions credits have accounted for, on average, 50% of Tesla's net income over the past 5 quarters; and, 1Q2025 would have actually had a negative net income of -$186 million without the $595 million in income from selling automotive regulatory credits that quarter. 



* And, while robotaxi is interesting and technologically, looks like it's trending towards feasibly working, Tesla still has safety drivers in the markets its operating in -which is mainly Austin at the moment - despite Musk saying it would reach half the U.S. population by the end of the year.  And, recent autonomous driving disclosures to the NHTSA indicate that in the most recent August month Tesla had 3 accidents for having less than 30 cars on the road, a ratio of 0.3/car/month. Waymo, in contrast had 51 incident reports in August for its 1,500 cars on the road across the country, a ratio 0.03/car/month and a factor of 10 less incidents per car per month than Tesla. And, while Musk has touted that Tesla is the leader in robotaxi for something like 8 years now, not only has Waymo factually rendered more autonomous rides with dramatically more mileage and, at this point, had demonstrated to be a working technology; but more and more competitors are popping up, such as Zoox in the U.S.; and pony.ai, BYD, and Baidu in Asia. Which is to say, competition is coming, and some would say has already come and surpassed Tesla, for the robotaxi space as well. 



* Additionally, if one takes a step back and compares the robotaxi market to the current ride-share market - as that's likely what it will displace since most people that own cars will presumably still want to have their own car - even assuming mature, robust market share and profit margins, the valuation is still probably under $300 range. For example, by my back of the envelope math there were approximately 100 billion ride share miles rendered worldwide in 2024. If you assume Tesla had 50% of that market (which is generally an unheard of market share in a market with decent competitions - Apple, for example, has a 25% global market share); and, assuming that, pursuant to Musk's own projections, the cyber cab was able to get cost per mile down to $0.30/mile, and they charged a reasonable $1/mile to riders, and that does not go lower with more competition; that would give 100 billion miles \* 0.5 market share \* $0.70 profit per mile = $35 billion profit off of robotaxis per year. $35 billion/3.4 billion shares = $10.29 per share and giving that a P/E of 30 gives you $308 target price. In other words, in a mature industry where Tesla robotaxi's had global reach and 50% market share, and profit margins of 70% per mile, the high price is still only $300 a share. 

**Tesla is up 30% this month to $450 a share as of today**, and likely trending towards a P/E of over 300 as it's EV sales profits are likely trending towards a range of $1 to $2. **Gotta love the American stock market!**",393,296,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nvg1dy/reminder_tesla_sales_trending_down_maybe/,new,Company Discussion,0.88

1nvbe1f,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 11:30:39,Amazon launches ‘price-conscious’ grocery brand with most products under $5,"Amazon on Wednesday expanded its private-label grocery lineup with the launch of a new brand aimed at “price-conscious” shoppers, with most products priced under $5.

The brand is called Amazon Grocery and includes more than 1,000 items, ranging from dairy, fresh produce, meat and seafood to snacks and baking essentials, the company said in a release. Amazon said the new offering unites its Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh brands under one label.

“During a time when consumers are particularly price-conscious, Amazon Grocery delivers more than 1,000 quality grocery items across all categories that don’t compromise on quality or taste – from fresh food items to crave-worthy snacks and pantry essentials – all at low, competitive prices that help customers stretch their grocery budgets further,” Jason Buechel, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide grocery, said in a statement.

It’s not the first time Amazon has experimented with a budget-friendly grocery brand. It launched a similar offering last September, called Amazon Saver, that was “focused on value.”

The move comes as Amazon’s grocery business has been in flux.

The company has continued to streamline its chain of Go cashierless convenience stores and Fresh supermarkets, announcing last week that it will close all of its locations in the U.K.

At the same time, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and other company executives have touted the success of sales of “everyday essentials” within its online grocery business, which refers to items such as canned goods, paper towels, dish soap and snacks.

The company last month expanded same-day delivery of fresh foods to more pockets of the U.S. as it looks to encourage shoppers to add meat and eggs to their order while they’re browsing its sprawling online store.

Here’s why I think CD388 is closer to 75%.

**Disclosure:** I hold shares of $CDTX. This is not investment advice.

In my original valuation post [CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or am I missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)  I modeled CD388 using a **75% probability of success (PoS)**. Some readers pushed back, saying Phase 3 programs are “coin flips” until final results are out.   That’s often true, but I think CD388, Cidara’s long-acting influenza prophylaxis, is further along than that. This post explains why I believe **75% is a realistic and conservative anchor** for estimating what the company should be worth today:

**1)   The dataset is unusually large and robust**  
Many Phase 2 programs enroll a few hundred patients. CD388’s phase 2b NAVIGATE trial had **over 5,000 participants** and took place across multiple geographies during an exceptionally strong flu season.  At the 450 mg dose, efficacy hit **76% vs placebo (95% CI: 49–90%, p<0.0001)**. That kind of result gives far more confidence than you’d get from smaller, underpowered studies that often precede a Phase 3.

**2)   The mechanism isn’t a leap of faith**  
Plenty of Phase 3 failures come from untested biology. CD388 leverages **zanamivir**, the active in Relenza, which already has 20+ years of human safety/efficacy data. The Fc extension used in CD388 changes the half-life, not the core antiviral mechanism, and Fc fragments have been widely used in other approved biologics without introducing new safety liabilities.

**3)   Safety looks clean so far**  
In NAVIGATE, no dose-dependent safety issues appeared across 150, 300, or 450 mg. Adverse events tracked with placebo.

**4)   FDA has signaled confidence**  
The FDA just recently accepted Phase 2b as **pivotal** and allowed a single Phase 3 to serve for BLA filing (see   [$CDTX: FDA Minutes Confirm Expanded + Accelerated Phase 3 for Cidara’s Flu Prophylaxis CD388](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npc6fd/cdtx_fda_minutes_confirm_expanded_accelerated/)). CD388 already has **Fast Track**, and the company has also applied for **Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)**. If granted, BTD would be a further strong validation, speeding review and signaling FDA’s view that CD388 meets a serious unmet need.

**5)   A exceptionally strong flu season stress-tested the drug**  
The 2024–25 flu season was severe, creating abundant endpoints and ensuring the trial was well-powered (better than expected). That adds confidence that efficacy wasn’t a fluke of low case counts.

**While the strong data and FDA support make it tempting to push the probability of success up a notch, I am anchoring it to 75% to stay \*conservative\*.**   The point isn’t that risk has vanished because clearly it hasn’t.  It’s that CD388’s Phase 3 isn’t the typical binary gamble retail investors assume for an asset at this stage of development.  Assuming 75% probability of success in my valuation model reflects the strength of the data and FDA’s stance without overstating the case.

**TL;DR (again):** Many Phase 3s are a coin toss in terms of probability of success. CD388 has strong data, a validated anti-viral mechanism, Fc fragment safety precedent, clean safety over a large phase 2b trial, and FDA confidence,  which is why I am sticking to a 75% probability of success in my valuation model.

I’ll be following up with a separate post to update my **valuation analysis** now that FDA minutes have confirmed the Phase 3 plan and expanded TAM to include all adults over 65.",4,6,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nv985m/cidara_cdtx_why_75_probability_of_success_for/,new,Company Analysis,0.63

1nuzqe0,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 01:18:58,PATH to Orchestration,"This morning, ahead of their Fusion conference in Las Vegas, UiPath released some massive press releases. The common theme across all of them - UiPath is partnering with the biggest tech companies to ensure that UiPath's workflow orchestration system, called Maestro, is at the top of its game and able to connect with the best agents and data tools.

They announced partnerships with Snowflake so that Snowflake's Cortex AI agent can integrate into Maestro. This is crucial as many of UiPath's customers have their data stored in Snowflake and will be leveraging their agents for data insights. They also announced huge partnerships with Google Gemini, OpenAI, and NVIDIA. I encourage you to read the press releases for yourself. 

Why is this so important? UiPath is not trying to create every AI agent from scratch - instead, they are building the platform that orchestrates all of the agents and robots at the top...like a Maestro does with a full string orchestra. This will allow UiPath to stay extremely nimble and allow their customers to have access to the best agents in the world - some of which will be built by other companies (CortexAI, NVIDIA) and others that will be in-house (UiPath's PeakAI).

I'm not suprised by these announcements - in my prior post with some detailed DD on PATH, I mentioned that they were already partnered with LangChain and Microsoft Copilot to break down any concerns of developing walled gardens. It's still early days in UiPath's second act; however, the path there is clear. If you are a believer that corporations will be building agentic automation into their workforce at scale, then you are bullish PATH. The company is carving out its spot as the agnostic platform (a.k.a. the Switzerland of automation) that will span across their customers' entire enterprises.",1,0,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuzqe0/path_to_orchestration/,new,Company News,0.56

* Student loan applicants would have to seek private student loans in the meantime.
* It’s likely to delay the publication of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly jobs report this week to a later day.
* The economic impact of a shutdown would likely be modest, with an estimated drag down on economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points each week it goes on.

1nuunc4,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 21:00:45,I am still bullish on CAVA,"I come in here to write up on a nice little stock I like to call CAVA. I just demoralized one of their Mediterranean bowls the other day, and when I was inside, some girl said, ""Why can't they open one up in Parksville?"" I almost said, don't worry shawty, eventually they will.

CAVA has just reached its 52-week low and touched 25 on the RSI yesterday. Its 52-week spread is honestly incredible, 172 high, 58 low, and I feel for those who bought in the triple digits. But I'm not done believing. And I'm CERTAINLY not fading them because of a 50x multiple. Can you guess Chipotle's multiple over the last decade? It is 77x. Over the last seven years, Chipotle grew EPS roughly 40% CAGR (excluding COVID). Chipper was really always trading at a premium.

Now, I'm not sitting here comparing them to Chipotle, just looking at an industry peer. But I want to put into perspective just how small CAVA is, and just how enticing this 2032 1,000-restaurant goal is. They currently only have 400 locations across the U.S. In 2007, one year after Chipper's IPO, they had \~700. Five years later, they doubled their store count, and in those five years, more than doubled their operating margin. In fact, Chipper's operating margin in 2007 was 7.5%, similar to CAVA's 7.38% last quarter. Rapid expansion in the QSR industry pushes margins, and like Ackman said, you can't go wrong owning a growing food chain.

I'm still bullish on CAVA, and yes, I own the shit out of it. I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts. Just wanted to provide a little historical context with Chipper, as they are widely considered the next Chipper in Mediterranean.",37,92,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuunc4/i_am_still_bullish_on_cava/,new,Unknown,0.66

1nushl2,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 19:20:49,How to manage a good quality startup stock?,"*EDIT: Clearly the word startup is causing confusion :) By startup, I am referring to a company that is in early stages, yet to prove / have a stable 'product' (but has proven its steps to get there), is growing fast, learning fast. This company is pre-revenue, publicly traded.*

I'll leave out the stock name to avoid clouding judgement and personal preferences over industry, company, etc. Keen to get your general thoughts on this stock managing question.

Essentially, there is a technology company (with hardware+software products) that's another couple of years away from properly generating revenue. It is a leader in its space, very innovative, very well-connected with traditional industry leaders, has great leadership with great technical background. They play it safe, do not boast. All in all, I feel quite confident in their direction and ability to navigate issues as they hit them. But - They've only hit limited milestones yet (limited compared to final target, but well on-schedule and not technologically limited by any stretch of imagination) and may hit various issues like any startup. Of course, they have good competitors too, though it is not crowded at the moment.

The stock tends to go up and down quite a bit, but I feel there is decent investor confidence.

The big questions are:

\- How much % of your portfolio would you invest in such a stock?  
\- Would you hold it forever? (or at least till it starts generating revenue and profits)  
\- Or would you try to do a bit of swing trading to time the up-downs? This could be even on a part of your holding, but of course there is no guarantee you will time it properly and very like you will get it wrong! But equally, it feels a shame to be holding on to say, 9-10% gain YTD when the stock's gone up and down 30-40%. Of course, like any good startup, as it starts generating revenue and stabilizes as a company, I wouldn't be surprised to see a 3x or more jump in share price...",0,32,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nushl2/how_to_manage_a_good_quality_startup_stock/,new,Unknown,0.14

Edit: if you ever wanted to know when to buy a stock or sell, just look to see if the comments are greedy or fearful.
Sentiment changes fast from my post not too long ago where I was also mocked for saying 230 in an AI bubble is unrealistic 

Recently I made a bold post,I claimed Nvidia would hit 230 by year end….

It’s possible but after today I’m disgusted by the price manipulation.

112,000,000 combined volume before a random thrust up? 

112,000,000/171,000,000 came from two huge bursts of volume. 

This changed my outlook and perception on Nvidia to the downside. If the company is mismanaging and manipulating the stock price to this degree I can’t say I want any part of this.

I looked into the so deal… OpenAI only generates 12B in revenue yet received 100billion? This just seems insane considering OpenAI burned 8billion this year and they’re not profitable but competing against google,tesla,meta that are very profitable especially in free cash flow. At least pets.com didn’t lose insane amounts of money each year.

So Nvidia, why did you invest 100billion in them? Where did these 112,000,000 volumes come from. Now that some random company with 224billion suddenly bought….super interesting 

I’m out of this stock, it’s too risky if it
‘s the case they need outside deals from ‘investors’ to keep a stock moving the way they’d like it to move 

Nvidia is the Enron of today and if you know that history it’s not good. 

One single miss on earnings in this stock that’s priced for perfection is insanely risky 

We usually also get 2 pullbacks in a year, I wonder what the excuse to rug pull will be from wall street

There is already a huge rise in unemployment of college grads compared to past 30 years trend.

I see everyone saying that AI may be a bubble or not a bubble but nobody is talking about what if populist politicians all over the world get in the way and make laws to limit the use of AI when they are reducing headcount.

Having said that, I am scratching my head on how can they even make a law restricting the running of a private company, seems like impossible to do it, isn't it?

Only thing that comes to my mind is: They can make a law to raise taxes on companies if they have increasing profit but reducing headcount. Sounds like a very bad idea since it goes against the very fabric of increasing output via efficiency.

On second thought I think this risk is very low since AI companies will also lobby against it, not to mention it is anti free market capitalism and reeks of a command economy like some communist countries.

Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said the company secured a three-year grace period from President Donald Trump’s promised tariffs on pharmaceuticals in a deal that would lower some of its US drug prices.

The company will sell some products at a 50% average discount on a direct-to-consumer website called TrumpRx, an initiative intended to allow Americans to pay cash for drugs at discounted rates negotiated by the government.

The deal appears to resolve two major threats facing Pfizer, as it would stave off more damaging drug pricing policies while shielding the company from future tariffs imposed by the administration’s Section 232 investigation into whether the cost of medicine represents a national security threat. 

It’s the latest example of the transactional nature of winning tariff exemptions from Trump, who has unilaterally wielded trade policy to exert power over multiple industries. As recently as last week, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on the industry. 

As part of its deal, Pfizer will offer across-the-board reductions on US prices for Americans enrolled in the Medicaid insurance program, giving them “most favored nation” pricing on some of its medicines, Trump said. He has repeatedly pressured companies to bring their US prices in line with what foreign countries pay for medicines.

“The United States is done subsidizing the health care of the rest of the world,” Trump said.

Bourla also announced a $70 billion push on research and development and domestic manufacturing over the next few years. The company was one of the rare exceptions among major drugmakers who rushed to highlight the return of manufacturing facilities to the US amid pressure from Trump.

“We now have the certainty and stability we need on two critical fronts, tariffs and pricing, that have suppressed the industry’s valuations to historic lows,” Bourla said in a statement.",419,144,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuhymn/pfizer_gets_threeyear_grace_period_from_trump/,new,Company News,0.96

One common argument on here is that Google's business model is not threatened by OpenAI, because the highest value searches (shopping related ones) are still done through Google, whereas OpenAI is capturing lower value queries.  So while people turn to LLMs for general questions, they still use Google for online shopping and click on sponsored ads. 

Most importantly, online retailers looking to advertise to people that are directly searching for their type of product really only had Google/Yahoo/Bing as an option, and Google had the majority of market share.

Today OpenAI killed this theory. OpenAI is in the process of integrating shopping directly into ChatGPT. It is still in its early stages, right now only supporting Etsy, and will soon rollout to Shopify. These platforms pay OpenAI for driving sales. 

CPC and CPM for Google ads are notoriously expensive, so if this goes well, expect more online retailers to implement deals with OpenAI, and cut Google ad spend as OpenAI drivers higher return on investment and such announcements boost share price. 

This is a much safer form of performance based advertising. Paying per click on Google ads is risky, because a click doesn't guarantee a sale. If OpenAI is charging a fee based on the final sale rather than per click, this makes marketing ROI much easier to predict.",261,130,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntsp96/openai_launching_instant_checkout_working_with/,new,Company News,0.8

WeRide’s whole thesis is scaling Level-4 autonomous taxis/shuttles worldwide, with major partnerships and pilots on 4 continents:

* **Middle East (Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Dubai)**: Largest public AV fleets outside the US/China. Tripled Abu Dhabi fleet, first Saudi L4 taxi permit, rides linked with Uber. Middle East fleet aims for 1,000 vehicles by 2030.
* **China (Shanghai)**: Launched L4 robotaxis with Chery Group and Jinjiang taxi firm; co-developed new EV “CER” model.
* **Southeast Asia (Singapore)**: Grab invested in WeRide; first fully driverless robotaxi service planned with thousands of AVs in SEA.
* **Europe (France, Belgium)**: Partnered with Renault for L4 robo-shuttles, pilot programs in Belgium and France.
* **Tech**: HPC 3.0 computing unit cuts AV compute cost \~50%, giving WeRide an edge.
* **Permits**: Holds L4 AV licenses in 7 markets (China, UAE, Singapore, France, Saudi, Belgium, US), more than any peer.

# Key Metrics & Valuation

* Market Cap: \~$2.9B.
* FY2024 Revenue: \~$50.2M; 2Q’25 alone $17.8M.
* Ownership: Founders hold \~4.8% each; corporate backers include SoftBank/Alliance Ventures and Zhengzhou Yutong. Top 25 holders own \~44%.
* Profitability: Unprofitable (2Q’25 net loss \~RMB406M), EPS deeply negative. Cash burn focused on R&D and expansion.
* Guidance: Ambition to scale to “thousands” of robo-vehicles by 2026.
* Analyst Outlook: Average 12-month price target \~$16.3, reflecting strong confidence in growth.

# Recent News & Catalysts

* **Belgium L4 Permit**: First-ever Belgian Level-4 test license for EZ10 Robobus in Leuven.
* **Dubai License**: Robotaxi trial permit; initial 50 GXR robotaxis, scaling to \~1,000 vehicles.
* **Grab Investment**: Strategic equity investment; L4 robotaxis to deploy across Southeast Asia.
* **Index & PR Wins**: Added to Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index; featured on Fortune’s 2025 Change the World list.
* **Saudi Launch**: First public robotaxi pilot in Riyadh with Uber.

**What to watch next:**

* Revenue growth in Robotaxi business.
* New regulatory permits
* Partnerships with the big guys (Uber, NVDA)
* Buybacks

**Bottom line:** While there are valuation concerns due to high multiples, WeRide is unprofitable **but** growing explosively. The Q2 beat, positive analyst coverage, and pipeline of high-profile deployments make a bullish thesis. With a \~$2.9B market cap and small revenue base, the unique global footprint – 30+ cities, dozens of AV permits, and strong industry backing, I see massive growth potential. Catalysts like EU/ME rollouts, index inclusion, and continued robotaxi scaling could drive the stock if execution stays on track.",13,2,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm28y/weride_wrd_bet_on_robotaxis_dd/,new,Unknown,0.76
1ntjtyt,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 10:41:29,Don't be afraid to miss the opportunity. You can't!,"We're in a situation where the stock market is inflated with worthless companies valued in billions - all because people want to buy the next Apple, Nvidia, or Google. Here's my point: you can't miss the next big thing. Successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Their success is a story that lasts for decades. Look:

In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey.

In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with their products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. Think it was late? In 2010, the stock was priced at less than $10.

In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was definitely too late? Ha!

See the pattern? Those stories show that a great business provides a window of buying opportunity measured in years, if not decades. Look at the greatest businesses and see how this pattern holds. FOMO is a lie! You have plenty of time to do your research and enter.

What I'm showing is how great businesses are picked: they change the world with their innovation. No need for empty words and marketing campaigns when you can witness the impact yourself, without a middleman.

A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research, take your time. Even after five years, we'll remain a great opportunity."" A scam business sells you an beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist.

Remember, 99% of start-ups fail even if at some point their stock price rise 10x in short amount of time. That means if you don't do your research and all you read is headlines and biased statements made by insiders, you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Eloquent words != an eloquent business model. Short term gain != long term success.  

Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products (some don't even have products), all because management is big on words, selling ""we are the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action. 

AI, Quantum, Energy, EV... there is always a next big thing screaming from all the corners ""Choose me!"". Before buying, ask this: ""Are you a great businesses? Have you demonstrated your excellence multiple times over the years? Can I witness the impact you make without a middleman's words?"" 

FOMO takes away your ability to analyse and think; it gaslights you with terms such as ""FUD"". A good investment withstands criticism and doubt. Lies needs to be loud because they're lies. Truth is truth no matter what - it doesn't care to shout.",0,17,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntjtyt/dont_be_afraid_to_miss_the_opportunity_you_cant/,new,Unknown,0.25

1ntg57l,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 08:03:28,Auto Parts Manufacturer Bankruptcy:  Impact on the parts retailers?,"First Brands filed for bankruptcy this morning and has major customer concentration in retailers like Autozone, O'Reilly, NAPA and similar.  The company would continue supplying parts, but what happens in the medium to long term with retailers when a major supplier falls down?   I assume that costs can go up as they seek wider sources of supply for their privately branded parts.   Any hiccup in metrics for these high valuation companies could at least be a set-back to their stock prices.

O'Reilly, for example trades at a steep PE multiple (38x last year's earnings) and achieved a $90 billion market cap last week (more than Target and Best Buy combined, and much more than either Ford or GM).   

Over time, these retailers have been borrowing ever larger amounts of money to buy back their shares, boosting their earnings per share figures.   Yet, their operating income (up 18%) is only growing at the rate of CPI inflation (15% since 2021), despite adding many new store outlets.   On average, O'Reilly has grown operating income per store only about 3% over four years which is way below inflation.  

I am betting those PE multiples will come down.   Even going from 38 down to 30 would be near-term hit to stock price.

1nso3q8,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 09:17:00,Wash Sales are Confusing,"Wash sales are a conundrum.
Wash sales are an oxymoron.
Wash sales are a black hole.
Wash sales are damnable. 

Let me explain. I’m considered the pattern day trader by my broker, interactive brokers. I am not one of those day traders that has five screens constantly trading five stocks at a time. I am a day trader that quite often just trade off my cell phone and I usually concentrate on one stock. Most recently it has been NVDA. I can assure you I’m not getting rich, there is no yacht in my future. I have no problem selling the stock for a total of five dollars profit. My goal is not to get rich,  just to give me something to do since I’ve retired. I recently ran across something that I have never seen nor did I know it was occurring. And that is an aspect of wash sales that I did not know was happening. Believe me when I tell you I understand wash sales since Scott trade shut down my trading for three days one time.

I have recently started trading a new stock and in seven days and over 50 trades I only had one loss- that  of a single  dollar. I have made a little  money off this stock. So I was surprised when interactive brokers raised my average price per share on a subsequent purchase  since I have incurred so little losses (a total of -$1 over 50 trades).

For those of you, like me who thought wash sale (or losses) were based on the total trade and not each individual trade you are wrong. It is enlightening. Let’s look at an example. 

The ABC corporation pays a good dividend and the stock price is pretty much range bound at $90 a share. But a rumor has surfaced that the ABC corporation will win a big contract and the share price goes up to $100 a share, you thinking if it’s true it will go higher so you buy one share at $100. Turns out the rumor is false and the share price drops to $80 a share. You knowing it is a $90 share company buy one share at $80. You now hold two shares with an average price of $90 a share. You sell your two shares at $91 per share and pocket two dollars. The price then drops to $70 a share. You realize this is just an over reaction to the loss of a potential contract and you buy one share at $70. But interactive brokers will reflect your average price per that one share at not $70 but at $79.  Because what I didn’t know was when I sold it at $91, I incurred a wash sale from where I purchased it from $100 and sold it at $91. I always thought the wash sale was based on the total sale and not each individual purchase. So when I sell my one share at $90 that I purchased at $70 interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11 ($90-$79). But this is a mirage.  It is an illusion. If you go check your realized gains interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11. YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN WILL ALSO REFLECT A PROFIT OF $11. This is for tax purposes only. If you go look at your cash report, according to interactive brokers, it will reflect a gain of $20. So those of you who are basing their profits off of a realized gain report it is not a true reflection of your actual trading.",0,20,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nso3q8/wash_sales_are_confusing/,new,Industry Discussion,0.45

1ns965v,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 19:12:41,"I would like to invest in Gold, Cooper and maybe Oil.","Hi everyone,

I'm french and watched some economic/financial tv shows. They are talking more and mora about metals and oil.

Yesterday, a financial analyst says 6 millions ton of cooper will miss in the next years. The main reason is typically the industrial sector need more and more, and the reserve are emptier and emptier. So maybe I wonder it's the best time to invest in a good mine company to enjoy the futur strong demand.

About gold, they expected the price will keep on rising strongly because the weakess of dollars and the currency policy of asian country (like the new habits of people) will push the demand. I've just sold Genesis Minerals, that looks a beautiful gold mines, but I needed some cash for another investment. Today, it's tricky to find a good point because too much vol.

Oil : It's tricky. One of them said it's a big time to invest in oil. The reserves look weak, and big oil companies tries to find more and more new reserve. But, the main of analyst said it's not a good move because today, every actor (included investment sector) bet on green energy and are not convinced oil will get a good bet on the next 5 years.

So i would like to get your opinion and if you got some stock to advise, you're welcome :)

Do you think the UNP/NSC merger will be value accretive, or are you worried about the price (as a UNP shareholder) and the additional debt of the combined entity?

Railroads have been by far my worse performing investment. I predicted more industrial integration between US, Canada and Mexico and an increase in trade, but boy was I wrong. In addition, I think the economic landscape is shifting to less higher quality products and software, so the volume of goods transported might increase at a slower pace than it has in the last decade (think cars sales for example). Also Business to consumer has lower margins and higher costs.

Still railroads have their infrastructure in place, are clearly cashflow positive, and pay a small dividend every year and buy back a few shares every quarter, so I don’t think they will lose lots of money long term.

Honestly, I am not a fan of NCS reliance on coal (although this administration doesn’t hate the product), and I am a bit concerned of the additional debt taken over by UNP, as well as the 27% share dilution.

However, the management is unlikely to bankrupt such a profitable company, and I can only see advantages owning such a big chunk of US commercial rail long term, at least for shareholders with a massive time horizon.

1nrc9au,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 16:35:20,Ramaco Resources METC and METCB,"Ramaco Resources is a metalurgical coal mining company that is developing rare earth minerals which have been found in softer clay strata located above and below the seams. Excitement over their rare earth potential is driving high interest in their stock, but mainly class A, $METC. Recent analyst forecasts for METC are $42 and $45. So, there's good potential for return beyond the current price of $31.

But here's the intriguing thing, class B stock is the tracking stock for the rare earth minerals. It will get 20% of the income generated by the rare earths, plus a coal fee per ton and royalty fees. There is currently 
10.84 million shares B extent and 55.18 million shares class A, putting class B at 16.4% of the total. So it certainly seems the better of the two, but class B ($METCB). is currently trading at a 50% discount to class B. 

I own some class B shares and so far, every time I compare dividends with class A, it's been better. Class B should never be worth more than A because the company has the right to convert them back to class A. But class B has the same asset claims as class A. 

This continues to amaze me and I keep coming back to see if there's anything I'm missing, so would really appreciate any insights you might have.

(My opinions, not financial advice. As noted, I do own shares in METCB.)

1nr23ui,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 09:59:44,"More Losses, More Liquidity: Who Really Wins Without PDT.","This legislation is just going to be a liquidity injection, more money for the brokers, more money for the Institutions and Market Makers. **Less for Retail.**

It’s a short term illusion of benefit to small players which always benefits institutions; a very common pattern in legislation. It’s never for you.  
Trading influencers will also love it.  
I’m not being cynical, I’m telling you how it is. Lobbyists influence the call.

Undercapitalised new traders will have a more accessible avenue to lose money. All this is, is a smoke screen to further enrich institutions. This post adresses key nuances in the arguement for and against PDT’s removal.

# Here’s my main point:

A lot of new retail traders avoid options because of the perceived complexity; a lot avoid futures because they don’t understand those derivatives either, and a lot have avoided day trading stocks because of the PDT rule. If these same people can’t find a solution to counter it before the legislation, they likely won’t put in the required work to have sustained profitability.

The same type of people who won’t put in the required work will be able to proceed with margin trading stocks when they shouldn’t. The newcomers, tryouts (both old and new) and the social-media influenced.

**The point is this legislation will have a net negative outcome for retail. If you combine (all net trader P&L)/NumberOfTraders it’ll be negative. Influencers and institutions will benefit. Not retail.**

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/kcs82kp7lirf1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=c91d791d95838ed0c5f53d63cdb09b3011823e85)

# Addressing Surface-Level Nuances

A trader had said,  
“People, like myself, could do small account challenges with only a few thousand and not be limited to PDT.”

This is very much like gambling with a bankroll in a less complex market.  
Margin trading stocks instead of options (which didn’t have a PDT rule).

This trader had also said,  
“There are tons of people in my circle who trade with both a full time job, family, and school. That has absolutely nothing to do with it. They trade just as successfully as others.”

For those thinking similarly, don’t let survivorship bias cloud your judgement. Profitability is different from sustained profitability. For now they are. **Check Figure 1.**

# Nuance 1: The Main Narrative 

“What you're not seeing, which is obvious is that by removing PDT rule, traders under 25,000 are no longer pressured to get a win on each trade.”

I get your point and understand it fully, but this is a deterrent to not margin trade stocks if a trader is undercapitalised. This stops people from margin trading stocks (trading with leverage). They can do whatever they want on a cash account with or without PDT; it’s a smoke screen so the decision can be justified to sceptics.

# Nuance 2: PDT doesn’t save people from giving their money to the market.

Here’s an example: Cigarettes are harmful but we should allow people to smoke, sure. But should we make it more accessible? Does it benefit the smoker or the tabacco industry more? Tabacco.

It’s like that with removal of PDT people will still trade, it just accelerates the losses and inflates undercapitalised retail participation.

**Margin trading is a choice, and PDT only restricts margin accounts.**

The point is this legislation will have a net negative outcome for retail. If you combine (all net trader P&L)/NumberOfTraders, it’ll be negative. Influencers and institutions will benefit. Not retail.

# Nuance 3: Should people who don’t have 25k to avoid PDT not trade?

That’s not what I said. If anything, I suggested that people who don’t have the time to trade consistently or aren’t rigorous enough with their trading are more likely to lose money.

I do this for a living and know what it takes. It’s not about capital; it’s about knowledge, effort and experience.

A lot of new retail traders avoid options because of the perceived complexity; a lot avoid futures because they don’t understand those derivatives either, and a lot have avoided day trading stocks because of the PDT rule. If these same people can’t find a solution to counter it before the legislation, they likely won’t put in the required work to have sustained profitability.

The same type of people who won’t put in the required work will be able to proceed with margin trading stocks when they shouldn’t. The newcomers, tryouts (both old and new), and the social-media-influenced.

# Nuance 4: most traders lose money so it's better to lose 2000 than lose 25000

If a Retail trader’s balance drops below 25000, the PDT rule kicks in.

**Nuance 4.1: Removal of PDT will be great and remove barriers to entry on the same playing field. PDT Removal will be the best thing to happen in retail stocks**

The points and statistics I’ve cited still apply; it’s financially better for market makers, institutions and brokers but not for retail traders

It’s an overwhelming net negative for the retail investor's pocket. whilst enriching institutions.

**Nuance 4.2: many new traders will have opportunities to grow in ways that wasn’t possible under the old rule**

Few out of many; for most (over 85%), it will be another opportunity to lose money quickly in a more accessible way.

It’s an illusion of freedom because margin trading stocks is an optional thing, and it’s a credit facility that’s offered to the retail trader to increase their risk.

The PDT rule was a limitation on how they could access the credit facility if undercapitalised; it was not about restricting freedoms.

In the 1920s, people were margin trading stocks whether they were average guy or institutional.

People got liquidated, and suddenly you have the Great Depression as a consequence. You need to understand these measures have effects that can cascade into something brutal for everyone.

**Nuance 4.3: It's 2025, not the 1920s, anymore.**

I get your point, but markets have operated in the same way for hundreds of years: supply and demand. Margin has also existed for hundreds of years. It’s nothing new.

# Nuance 5: AI screeners and other tools became more common. It's easier to identify winning stocks now!

This isn’t true and it’s a short term anecdotes don’t hold weight and trend that will be corrected by market algorithms. You need to realise that over the strategies over the medium term can have the illusion of being profitable.

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/w12ck7smlirf1.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fcbcf9a25a68820909b33f246bd1b9ad4e43176)

# Nuance 6: Far more people agree that this change is better than not changing it

This doesn’t mean it’s in your best interest. It’s marketed that way. There should be no appeal to emotion; this should be a redundant factor.

Everything in markets is mathematics and statistics. I’ve read several research papers and over a dozen books. Look at fund managers, practitioners (prop guys), quants, and portfolio managers; they all take it into account, and every profitable trader I’ve communicated with who can present trading statements to prove it takes them into account.

# Nuance 7: You're looking at the negative; it's true you could accelerate losses just as it is as true as you could accelerate winning.

Most traders lose money; that’s a fact, regardless of the exchange. I’m not looking at just the negative; I acknowledge there’ll be winners too. Just very few. Most that win will lose everything they make and/or more due to human psychology, the sunk cost fallacy and other factors.

**Nuance 7.1 It's 2025; we have access to information unlike any other time period in the history of stock trading.**  
That just makes the market more efficient/random this makes market movements harder to predict and profit

**Nuance 7.2 You can look at statistics, but these statistics are based on the 25,000 PDT Rule.**

Most retail traders, over 85%, lose money (according to ESMA, the most generous value), and over long timescales, \~98% lose money. Removal of PDT will increase the number of people margin trading (trading with leverage), which will increase the number of losses and liquidations.

# Ending / Agenda

For transparency: I don’t trade US equities, and I am a UK-based trader; think of me as playing the devil’s advocate.

**If you don’t trade stocks, why bother debating this?**  
I have experience in trading US equities, but I don’t currently trade them; I trade futures and CFDs.

I posted this because I want traders to understand that these legislative changes are rarely in their best interest.  
**Lobbyists make the call.**

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

My understanding is that Hedged indexes protects from currency fluctuations in my case EUR-USD, but with some extra TER cost, in this example 0.03%

Am i wrong in thinking that the extra 0.03% (i know it is compounded over time) is worth the spent to protect from the currency fluctuations? I am not experienced enough to understand Forex and this is why I prefer to play it a little safer. Am I wrong in thinking that?

Also, the NQSE is 10x smaller (hedged - i know it is newer as well), is that because people prefer to get a riskier ETF (SXRV unhedged) that will generate more profit if the EUR will get weaker than USD?

Is the unhedged like investing in both the stocks themselves and forex while hedged is just the stocks?

Which ones do you prefer for long term?

- Splinter Cell game
- Gritty Assassins Creed set in 18th century Germany
- Rayman game
- Far Cry game

With construction underway coast-to-coast, Lumen is moving forward a multi-billion-dollar build with plans to add 34 million new intercity fiber miles by the end of 2028, for a total of 47 million intercity fiber miles. The company has already delivered millions of new fiber miles, network capacity upgrades and high-speed connectivity enhancements in 2025, building the network infrastructure enterprises need to power their AI workloads.

“AI is fueling a surge in network demand like we’ve never seen, and Lumen is building the backbone to meet it,” said Kye Prigg, executive vice president, enterprise operations, Lumen Technologies. ""This isn’t incremental – we plan to more than double the size of our U.S. network. We’re positioning Lumen as the trusted network for AI, ensuring our customers have the network scale, speed, and reliability to confidently innovate and grow without constraints.”

**2025 milestones on the road to 47 million intercity fiber miles****^(1)****:**

* **Deployed New Fiber:** Added more than **2.2 million new intercity fiber miles**(2,500+ route miles) and projected to reach 16.6 million total intercity fiber miles by year end. Lumen is utilizing next-generation fiber optic cable from Corning Incorporated to fit two times more fiber into existing conduit.
* **Constructed Signal Boosters:** Construction efforts underway at **176 In-Line Amplifier (ILA) sites**. ILA shelters built on these sites serve as giant signal boosters along the Lumen network with up to triple the power density compared to traditional ILA shelters and are designed to be updated, renewed, and scaled for the future.
* **Expanded Conduit Access:** Completed **IRU conduit deployments across 55 additional routes** expanding Lumen’s ability to add and control fiber on these routes by securing long-term rights to underground pathways.
* **Increased Network Capacity:** Added **5.9+ Pbps of total capacity** to the Lumen network so far this year, preparing to deliver the bandwidth needed to handle large volumes of data processing.
* **Extended Faster Speeds**: Earmarked more than **$100 million to bring high-speed connectivity** up to 400Gbps across clouds, data centers, and metros, creating a more seamless, high-performance pipeline for AI workloads. **The Lumen 400G-enabled network now spans more than 100,000 route miles**.

Lumen Private Connectivity Fabric (PCF) is designed for AI workloads. By using fiber with 25% less optical loss than competitors^(2) and 60% more capacity than traditional designs, PCF helps move data more efficiently and at greater scale. The Lumen network achieves latency less than five milliseconds at the edge, covering up to 97% of U.S. business demand. And with diverse routes connecting more than 50 major cities, Lumen operates the largest ultra-low-loss intercity fiber network in North America.

“Every mile of new fiber and capacity upgrade adds to the strength of our Private Connectivity Fabric. Lumen is doing more than expanding infrastructure, we’re laying the foundation for the AI economy,” added Prigg.",19,15,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nqv9l4/lumen_accelerates_multibilliondollar_network/,new,Company News,0.79

1nqm5g2,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 19:35:41,Tesla’s continuing sales slump in Europe weighs on stock price,"Tesla shares fell more than 4% on Thursday after data out of Europe showed a continuing sales slump for the automaker, despite strong demand for fully electric vehicles in the region. 

Tesla EV registrations in Europe, a proxy for sales, fell by about 23% year-over-year in August, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) on Thursday.

There were 14,831 Tesla EV registrations in Europe last month, down from 19,136 in August 2024. In the first eight months of this year, Tesla EV registrations in Europe declined 32.6%, the ACEA said.

Meanwhile, total EV registrations throughout the region rose by around 26% through August compared to the same period in 2024. By contrast, registrations for petrol and diesel-powered vehicles declined by more than 20% over that stretch.

Still, RBC analysts wrote in a note on Thursday that they expect Tesla’s total deliveries for the third quarter could amount to 456,000, above a FactSet-compiled consensus of 448,000 deliveries and a Visible Alpha consensus of 440,000 deliveries.

The analysts expect a bump for Tesla as consumers rush to buy EVs in the U.S. before a $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of September.

Even with Thursday’s slide, Tesla’s stock has bounced back following a brutal start to the year. It’s now up 5% in 2025 after plunging 36% in the first quarter.

Musk’s political activism in the U.S. and beyond has hurt the Tesla brand and dampened its appeal to many prospective EV buyers.

Earlier this year, Musk endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party, and this month he appeared by video at an anti-immigrant rally in the U.K. that turned violent. The rally was led by activist Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rebuked Musk for “dangerous” comments that he made at the rally, where 26 police officers were injured. Musk told attendees, “violence is coming to you” and “you either fight back or you die.”

To revitalize interest in the brand, Tesla has said an affordable new model is in the works, which could help it fend off increased competition from the likes of Volkswagen, BYD and other EV makers that have been picking up market share.

1nqft68,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 15:15:50,UPST: AI + Finance with BIG squeeze potential at play!,"$UPST (Upstart) is a AI powered lending platform and currently have around a **26%** float short with **3.2** days to cover. In 2021 they hit almost **$400** per share and with the lower interest rate environment their fundamentals are drastically improving again!

**Why it’s squeezable**

* **Short interest:** **\~21.1M shares** short = **\~26.3%** of float; **days to cover \~3.2**.
* **Float:** \~**84.1M** shares.
* **Borrow dynamics:** IBKR **CTB \~0.4–0.6%** lately; available shares fluctuating (\~150k–350k seen). If price trends up, borrow can dry up fast.

**Fundamentals massively improving**

* **Q2’25 revenue:** **$257M, +\~102% YoY.**
* **GAAP net income:** **+$5.6M** (vs. loss a year ago).
* **Volume:** loans +\*\*\~159% YoY\*\*, dollar volume **\~$2.8B**.
* Balance sheet and guidance commentary point to continued normalisation of funding.

**Macro tailwind**

* **U.S. Q2 GDP revised to 3.8% annualized**, a solid backdrop for risk assets and consumer credit cyclicals like UPST

**Price targets**

* Street 12 month PTs cluster around **$81 avg** (range **$47–$108**), implying notable upside from here. However, this could go MUCH higher with the interest rate cuts now planned and their improving financials - plus with the squeeze potential.

**Catalysts**

* Next earnings + any funding/partner expansions
* Options OI building into earnings can add fuel too

**Levels I’m watching**

* Break/hold above recent supply zone = go time, invalidation is a decisive close back below the last higher low so watch for this...

**Thesis:** Shorts are crowded into a name that just flipped back to profitable with triple digit revenue growth, right as macro prints strong. If UPST clears resistance with momentum then its going to blow up...

I'm curious, should I wait for the stock price to come down, or is it okay to buy at a higher price if it seems to keep rising?

1nq6s8e,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 09:28:39,Intel jumps 8%… while Marvell spends $5B on buybacks,"This morning while scrolling through Bitget’s RWA perpetual futures index, I stumbled on something I honestly didn’t expect: **Intel pumping +8%** and Marvell announcing a $5 billion share buyback. I wasn’t expecting to see these two “old guards” of semiconductors shaking the market at the same time.

For Intel, the rally came from a mix of catalysts lining up. Micron’s strong earnings gave confidence back to the sector, and Intel raised its outlook for 2025. With around 76% market share in x86, they’re better positioned than many thought. Digging deeper, I saw they’re preparing the Panther Lake (18A) launch for late 2025, getting US government and SoftBank support for their AI/foundry ambitions, and placing large orders with ASML for the next-gen High-NA EUV machines. They even announced an AI partnership with Trust Stamp, focusing on biometrics and privacy. No surprise analysts bumped the price target up to $43 with a buy rating.

Marvell, on the other hand, is playing a different card: a massive $5 billion buyback, including a $1B accelerated program with $300M already executed this quarter. Instead of betting on a future product or tech breakthrough, they’re giving back directly to shareholders to boost confidence in the near term.

What struck me is the contrast. Intel is trying to rewrite its future by going all-in on AI and foundry, while Marvell is choosing immediate stability. Two very different visions in the same sector, but both managed to move the market big time at the same moment.

What do you think? Can Intel really reinvent itself for the long run, or is this just a short-term rebound?",146,119,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nq6s8e/intel_jumps_8_while_marvell_spends_5b_on_buybacks/,new,Company Discussion,0.95

Copper prices jumped Wednesday after Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) declared force majeure on contracted supplies from its Grasberg Block Cave mine in Indonesia.

Three-month futures traded above $10,496 per ton ($4.7710 per lb.) on the CME, up 2.74% for the day. In London, copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 2% to $10,172 a ton on the London Metal Exchange, the highest level in more than 15 months.

Freeport’s shares fell as much as 10.4% in New York, while rivals Glencore PLC (+3%), Teck Resources (+5%), and Antofagasta (+7.4%) climbed.

Analysts described it as a “negative near-term development that will likely put Freeport in the penalty box.” However, BMO also highlighted that 60% of Freeport’s copper production comes from North and South America, meaning the company still has strong regional output. At the same time, a potential increase in copper prices stemming from reduced supply could partly offset the impact.",33,2,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nq3oqn/copper_price_spikes_on_freeports_grasberg_force/,new,Unknown,0.88

1nprxr3,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 19:52:44,"Nvidia Stock, poised to surpass 230 by year end","Nvidia stock is very misunderstood. Many have been shorting at 180’s and buying at 170’s. It’s been doing this since July 28th. Consolidating for nearly two months.

Nvidia’s key points 

1. They’re not lying about demand. I haven’t heard anyone comment about China not being relevant to their success…the reason Nvidia isn’t concerned is simply because demand surpasses supply even without China.

2. Nvidia has been talking with intel behind the scenes for about a year confirmed by Jensen. If we read in between the lines it means they’ve likely already sucessfully merged a product with intel. Nvidia should never be underestimated with the resources they have at their disposal. Another market Nvidia will dominate and quickly take shares of.

3. Nvidia is an early investor in many of the upcoming giants of tomorrow like NBIS and CoreWeave. All those gains are net positives for Nvidia and only contribute to continued growth. NBIS for example has the most significant growth rates I’ve ever seen a company produce. 820percent revenue before Microsoft deal? That’s execution.

4. OpenAI isn’t a public company,Nvidia is now getting a slice of the most desired AI  company that’s still operating privately. People don’t understand that now Nvidia will have access to all the data OpenAI has…

I could just go on for paragraphs about all the deals Nvidia is doing, about the acceleration of new products but one thing we forgot to mention is Nvidia Hasn’t Moved in Stock price despite having a forward PE of 31…..while the s@p average is currently 27. Why is that you ask? Because currently the market couldn’t give a sht about value.The needle won’t explode with a stock valued at 4.35trillion like oracle or Crypto. 

Nvidia is an exceptional company that’s constantly preformed,evolved and is without a doubt the centre of AI and even still insane growth potential. 

Stocks spend months in consolidation period Nvidia has definitely been doing that, simply a no brainer buy. 

It’s an Undervalued stock considering it’s crop dusting any other of the mag 7. 

I am an Nvidia Investor and I’ve added more today at 176.20 as I believe we’ll see a big rotation in Nvidia and several other chip stocks, I’ve averaged up from 91 to a current of 120 because I see this as a great opportunity for solid gains.

Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

• **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

• **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

• **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
• AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
• Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
• More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
• New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
• Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
• Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
• Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
• Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
• Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
• Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
• Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
• High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
• Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
• Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
• Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
• Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
• Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
• Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
• Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
• Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",259,114,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/,new,Company Discussion,0.83

> Regulators are moving to dismantle one of the most controversial barriers for active retail traders the $25,000 minimum equity rule for pattern day trading. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority on Tuesday approved amendments that would replace the long-standing threshold, making active day trading more accessible to smaller accounts. The change is pending approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

> The $25,000 minimum equity rule mandates that traders must maintain a minimum account balance of $25,000 in a margin account to execute four or more day trades within a five-business-day period. The rule was put in place in 2001 amid the dot-com bubble and crash as regulators grew worried that small traders were taking excessive risks with volatile internet stocks.

> FINRA is replacing this mandate with an intraday margin rule that applies the existing maintenance margin rules to intraday exposure. In other words, one’s intraday buying power will be based on the margin requirements for the positions they take on during the day, not a fixed equity minimum.

I have been with my advisor for a very long time. More than 20 years. Up until the last few years I was extremely busy, and mentally fully occupied, with a demanding career. I left things to the advisor, although I met with him annually. His approach has been very conservative for an extremely conservative throughout that time, way before retirement was on the horizon, and returns have been muted even though the market has shown a long-term uptrend. In a nutshell, it is his practice not to own any individual stocks in a portfolio, in deference to various bond/money market and mutual fund investments. Think 60/40 scenario. A substantial amount of the portfolio has been devoted to foreign stocks, also held in mutual funds, that for many years were essentially flat or declined to some extent compared to US equities. In the last year or so, those have done much better as we all know. These investments have shifted and been adjusted over the years, but very slowly, and with little responsivity to large changes in market conditions. My question is essentially is this a common approach for financial advisors? Of course, it’s clear that such an approach makes managing client’s accounts much less labor intensive, and if one’s clientele is especially sensitive to volatility, it minimizes that factor and probably calms nerves. So it’s easier for an advisor to approach things this way.

This is an extremely tricky situation. The Fed thinks they can rate-cut their way to lowering unemployment. This is not going to work. Lowering rates simply frees up capital - it doesn't guarantee job creation. There is currently no shortage of capital as evident by the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI infrastructure. Lowering rates will simply free up more cash for these types of long-term AI investments that will end up reducing more human labor than it creates.

Also, as the Fed lowers rates, inflation (compounded by tariffs driving up costs) will go much higher. This puts the Fed in a very uncomfortable economic trend called stagflation. It's the elephant in the room that no one wants to publicly say. We're heading toward stagflation. Risk assets will sell off in the short-term. In the longer-term, there will be winners and losers.

1npf99s,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 11:30:25,"Fermi America IPO, is this Legit?","It seems like this company is well positioned to do what they say they would. They plan to supply the energy for data centers with a nuclear plant in Amarillo, Texas. It was founded by Rick Perry and Toby Neugebauer who both have deep ties to both the Texas government and Texas energy sector; which likely smooth permitting processes/timelines. Work and construction set to begin next year, and first plant operational by 2032.

But there’s three big red flags for me. For one this company is relatively new. The second piece is going back to the fact that this plant would be in Amarillo, Texas. Where are they going to get the water from to cool a nuclear plant, and how the heck would it be affordable if it needs to be piped in from somewhere else? Last piece is cash burn, I’ve read they’ve secured 350M in private funding already; and are hoping to secure another 550M from going public. But I see that nuclear plants can cost anywhere from 6B-9B, so for something that would be completed in 7 years it seems like they would need more cash than they hope to get via IPO to meet that goal. Do they already have contracts lined up that’ll front the construction costs? Or maybe government funding they’re expecting that hasn’t been announced? 

All to say, some numbers aren’t adding up to me here and the company is pretty fresh. If it weren’t for the founders having deep ties to the Texas energy sector I could more definitively say this is an AI hype cash grab than a legitimate push.  

The primary growth prospects before the plant opens is the company hitting construction milestones, potentially receiving government funding, and signing contracts to supply data centers. At that point it seems like you’d sell the news.

Any other thoughts on this? I’d personally need to see answers around where the water comes from and how they expect to get the rest of the cash needed for construction given the aggressive timeline btwn now and the first plant opening.

1npc6fd,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 09:29:35,$CDTX: FDA Minutes Confirm Expanded + Accelerated Phase 3 for Cidara’s Flu Prophylaxis CD388,"In my first post ([CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or am I missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)) I hinted (very strongly!) that FDA minutes for Cidara's ""End of Phase 2"" meeting could be a major turning point for Cidara. That news is now official, and it’s even stronger than expected:

**1. Phase 3 accelerated**

* Start pulled forward by 6 months:  enrollment begins Fall ’25 in the Nothern Hemisphere, not Spring ’26 as previously planned.

**2. Single Phase 3 may be sufficient for approval**

* FDA supporting that CD388 could go straight to a **BLA filing off one registrational study** if phase 3 is successful. That cuts **2–3 years** off the approval timeline.

**3. Expanded patient population**

* Originally: high-risk comorbidities + immunocompromised.
* Now: also includes **all adults ≥65**, significantly expanding U.S. eligibility to **100M+ patients**.

**Why this matters**

* FDA support for BLA filing after this phase 3 trial is a huge signal of confidence.
* The accelerated start reduces time-to-revenue.
* Expansion to ≥65 significantly expands the potential TAM.
* Together, these updates shrink the “binary biotech discount” the market is still applying to CD388.

**What’s next?**

The next milestone is a potential BARDA award, with a decision expected by year-end (unclear if that means government fiscal year-end in September or calendar year-end in December).

Cidara has been clear: they are seeking BARDA’s help to onshore and scale manufacturing capacity. That may not mean an immediate stockpiling contract, but it’s still a strategic step. For CD388 to play a role in pandemic preparedness, the U.S. government will want domestic supply secured.

So the way I see it:

* Best case: BARDA supports manufacturing build-out and future stockpiling.
* Baseline case: BARDA helps de-risk manufacturing scale-up, validating CD388 as a preparedness asset.

Either outcome reinforces CD388’s long-term strategic value.

**Bottom line**

Universal flu prophylaxis used to be fiction. With today’s FDA minutes, CD388 is:

* Accelerated
* Expanded
* Supported by the FDA
* And fully funded through Phase 3

The market is still treating CD388 like a long shot. Today’s FDA news makes it clear: this is less and less about ""if"",  and increasingly about ""when.”

In my next post, I’ll do a deeper dive into why CD388’s probability of success is higher than most Phase 3 assets and update my rNPV valuation to reflect this news.

1npbyeg,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 09:20:09,$PATH Toward a Multi-bagger,"I have been building my position in PATH for about a year now and am starting to see a recent surge in interest. After noticing a bunch of ""why PATH?"" posts across various subreddits, I decided to provide my thesis:

* UiPath's flagship legacy product is currently the MARKET LEADER in enterprise Robotic Process Automation (RPA) - automating repetitive, generally clerical tasks for enterprises by leveraging PATH's ""software robots"" which can scrape processes and repeat tasks very efficiently (think of robust ""if this, then that"" rules).
* In October 2024, they announced that they were re-building their software suite to be focused on agentic AI with the goal of becoming the primary agnostic software player that would automate entire workflows at the top layer of the enterprise and allow customers to build across third party applications (i.e., not caging enterprises into the walled gardens of Salesforce, Microsoft, etc.). This is a game-changer, as it would go way beyond the rule-based constraints of RPA - it would leverage generative AI to let the software make decisions across platforms.
* In Spring of 2025, UiPath released their Maestro enterprise orchestration software and began putting together proof-of-concepts for their customers. The feedback has been great as Maestro allows customers to build custom end-to-end workflows that combine UiPath's industry-leading RPA technology with the newly released suite of generative AI capabilities. UiPath has a huge advantage over competition as they are already a trusted provider of software automation for over TEN THOUSAND enterprise customers.
* Their go-to-market strategy is super compelling as they have massive partnerships with Deloitte and SAP to help market their products. They also have strong relationship with other software providers like LangChain and Microsoft to ensure UiPath is staying relevant and connected with top companies in the supply chain.
* From a financial perspective, their balance sheet is INSANELY STRONG. Zero debt and $1.5B of cash/marketable securities on-hand.
* They recently made a strategic acquisition of Peak AI to further their product offering by adding a specialized inventory and pricing management AI agent to their software stack.
* Their CEO and founder Daniel Dines is a GENIUS who owns 10% of the company (massive skin in the game). He had the vision, technical prowess, and leadership skills to essentially invent the enterprise RPA market and dominate it before anyone else - he is now going after the enterprise agentic AI space.
* Share price is currently insanely cheap at 4-5x trailing twelve-month sales. Their revenue has been growing at decent clip of \~10% per year, but that doesn't even include the inevitable growth of their agentic AI products that are just now starting to be marketed and gain traction. The market has been sleeping on UiPath and the growth of their new agentic AI automation software is not priced in at all - the industry is projected to grow at a 40% CAGR between now and the end of the decade. Even in a stock market pullback, I think downside risk is pretty limited given the cheap multiple they're already trading at.
* A weakening labor market (which is where we're headed) is bullish for a company that is selling software that allows companies to automate processes and ""do more with less"". So owning PATH is also a natural hedge against the unemployment rate going up.

For all these reasons, PATH has become the second largest position in my portfolio.

Literally any investing related sub will tell you that. The most common advice is “time in the market beats timing the market,” and that if you buy quality companies or broad index funds and just hold for decades, you’ll come out ahead.

But then I see so many people actively trading stocks. Sometimes daily, sometimes weekly, trying to time short term moves. From the outside, it feels like that goes against the idea of long-term compounding, especially when you factor in taxes and trading costs.

So what exactly is the appeal of trading over long-term investing? Do traders believe they can consistently beat the market? Is it more about short-term cash flow rather than long-term wealth building? The excitement that comes with it?

Been looking at some periodic rebalancing of my holdings in my long-term portfolio, and I'm both in VOO and VYM. I liked having a mix, and VYM is known for its dividend yield, AND also how it weathered the 2022 bear market. I'm having trouble finding the tools on Fidelity to compare both, including their dividends. While VYM only did +76% over the last 5yrs, and VOO around +101%, VYM carries the dividend factor that offsets some of that gap and brings it closer.

What's your take on it, and where should I be looking forward?

I've also begun investing in VGT, which is the tech sector - which I think is a hot one right now. Over 5yrs, that one did +145%! As long as AI is driving the market in a big way, I think the tech sector one is a good one to have, at least short-term.",0,4,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nox758/voo_vs_vym_longterm/,new,Unknown,0.5

> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday noted that asset prices, a category that typically includes stocks and other risk instruments, are at elevated levels. During a speech in Providence, Rhode Island, the central bank leader was asked how much emphasis he and his colleagues place on market prices and whether they have a higher tolerance for higher values.

> “We do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we’re trying to achieve,” Powell said. “But you’re right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued.” In the run-up to last week’s policy meetings, stocks and other assets rallied strongly as conviction grew that that the Federal Open Market Committee would be lowering its benchmark overnight borrowing rate. Stocks have continued to climb, setting a succession of record highs for major averages, since the decision Wednesday to cut by a quarter percentage point.

> “Markets listen to us and follow and they make an estimation of where they think rates are going. And so they’ll price things in,” Powell said in part of the conversation dealing with mortgage rates. Though Powell noted the lofty equity values, he said this is “not a time of elevated financial stability risks.”",1103,169,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1noq1ae/fed_chief_powell_says_stock_prices_appear_fairly/,new,Unknown,0.96

> On the heels of Nvidia’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI, two research notes out today suggest the current boom in AI may be unsustainable.
> 
> “AI machines - in quite a literal sense - appear to be saving the U.S. economy right now,” George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank wrote to clients. “In the absence of tech-related spending, the U.S. would be close to, or in, recession this year.”

The bad news is that in order for the tech cycle to continue contributing to GDP growth, capital investment needs to remain parabolic. This is highly unlikely.”
> 
> He also noted that “growth is not coming from AI itself but from building the factories to generate AI capacity.”

> AI spending is also distorting the stock market, Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid argued in a separate note published this morning. “The S&P 500 is now up +13.81% so far this year, whereas the equal-weighted version is only up +7.65%.

That combination makes AMSC one of the cleaner mid-cap growth plays I’ve seen recently but there’s very little discussion around this company compared to other energy-adjacent players.

American Superconductor (AMSC) is a ~40 year old systems company for megawatt-scale grid resilience, data centers, wind controls and naval ship protection (high-power electronics, STATCOMs/D-VAR, high-temp superconducting wire which is basically super efficient power transmission, ship protection systems). The company recently added NWL, which brings recurring industrial and defense power sales. They seem to be a differentiated niche leader. AMSC owns useful HTS and power-electronics IP and has won program-level naval and utility work (like a ~$75M Canadian Navy deal). That combination (IP + visible contracts + cash/backlog) is what makes the company interesting to me.

If AMSC consistently convert bookings at decent margins and avoid further dilution, you get margin expansion + multiple re-rating (defense contracts + grid demand are sticky, and their tech is already shipping). If they don’t, downside is fast. Same facts cut both ways. The company has a very relevant set of products as energy grids and fleets demand more power density and stability to integrate wind, solar, rapidly-increasing data center loads and advanced naval systems.

I’m curious to hear from anyone who knows much about AMSC, currently invests in them, or understands their market niche well. Trying to gauge if there’s as much upside left here as it seems.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I am probably not the only one that sees the gap between perceived reality and the market. Still, I am wondering if there are factors I do not take into consideration. It makes sense that the ones with money made the most since Covid and that there are sectors such as AI, that serve as investment vehicle.

But is that all? It all seems like smoke to me. All of the geopolitical events had a comparingly small impact on the market, expect for Covid, while the green candles just keep rising. Is it newly printed money that enter the markets?

I just cant help but think the TikTok deal was built into that outlook. Oracle said they signed 3 multi billion dollar contracts but didn’t say which ones. They projected rev this year to be 18B, and by 2029 144B annually. This kind of projected growth by a tech dinosaur, in my opinion should not be met with the kind of surge we just saw. Especially when the company has been missing earnings projections on and off for years. That is a wait and see if I ever saw one.

It just feels like blatant insider trading. Everyone knew Oracle was getting the deal. Everyone knew earnings call was going to be the moment to jump.

*Oklo Inc today holds a groundbreaking ceremony at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for its first Aurora powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”*

*“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.*

*The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.*

*“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”*",86,45,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1no03ff/oklo_breaks_ground_on_first_aurora_powerhouse/,new,Company News,0.92

What is a good strategy to capitalize on a still very young industry with new players joining every day? I'm currently seeing three main segments that drive revenue with a TAM that's rapidly expanding across all three segments:

**Infrastructure**
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft and Oracle are building chips and datacenters to generate compute. All of the MAG7 companies are investing heavily in their own facilities to become a big player in the scene without any sign of slowing down.

**Data**
The place the internet comes together is a goldmine for LLM's to be trained on. Places Like X (Twitter) (owned by xAI) GitHub (owned by Microsoft, very valuable for coding), Stack overflow, Wikipedia, Quora, but maybe the biggest and most valuable of them all, yes, Reddit. A very important aspect of why Reddit's conversations are very valuable is because there is no money incentive like on X. The company has gone public in 2024 and has done licensing deals with Google and OpenAI and others worth 200M+ annually. They are reportedly currently in talks with Google for a much bigger deal. The platform is imo mildly monetized and thus growing rapidly. A company worth looking into financially.

**Applications**
Probably the biggest and widest segment that has yet to fully materialize is the way AI has been putting itself on the market as a product. The most obvious applications are LLM's like ChatGPT, but OpenAI is not close to profitability. Self-Driving cars are also slowly being applied, but in low numbers. Public companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and Palantir are among a bigger group of companies well positioned to thrive in this segment.

AI is no longer just a buzzword. The companies that control infrastructure, data, or applications are setting the rules of the game. The next few years are going to separate the leaders from the followers. If you’re looking to understand where value is being created, AI is still a an early opportunity.",1,19,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nny89w/long_term_ai_strategy/,new,Industry Discussion,0.52

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

First, let’s state the obvious: we’re not in a low-rate environment right now. However there are some things happening that are leading to one. Regardless of your views of the current U.S. president, he’s been pushing Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. So far, Powell has remained focused on the economic data and stayed independent in his decision-making. However, Powell’s term ends in about eight months (May 15, 2026). Once that happens, it seems almost inevitable that Trump will try to appoint someone more in line with his agenda, someone who will likely push for rate cuts until his target rate of around 1.5% is reached (this seems to be the consensus, though I’ve seen various estimates).

If/when that happens, I expect markets to take off for the foreseeable future. Why? Because lower rates mean cheaper borrowing. A simple(although flawed as mortgage loans are amortized amongst other things) example:

A $500K home at 2% interest would cost roughly $665K over 30 years (assuming no early payments).

A $500K home at 6% interest would cost $1.1 million over the same period.

This is basic economics, lower interest rates increase borrowing power, which lets companies expand faster and take on more risk.

Does this mean we’re heading for another major recession or depression eventually? Probably. But that timing is much harder to predict than the markets’ current expectation that a low-rate environment is coming.",51,30,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nntg89/in_a_low_rates_environment_nearly_all_equities/,new,Broad market news,0.78

1. Eli Lilly (LLY) – With its advanced immuno-oncology pipeline and existing blockbusters, it feels almost unavoidable. What stands out is their ability to diversify revenue while staying a leader in such a competitive field.


2. Pfizer (PFE) – Known for vaccines, but their oncology division is getting stronger with targeted acquisitions. Despite the post-COVID slump, I think they remain a solid long-term player in cancer treatment.


3. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) – Probably one of the most robust oncology portfolios. Their CAR-T therapies look very promising, and while the stock price isn’t exploding right now, I believe it’s one to keep on the radar.



The only issue on my side: I’m still pretty new to stocks.  I noticed that some crypto platforms like Bitget are starting to list tokenized US stocks and RWAs, I’m not sure if that is very similar to traditional broker.

Demand for Nvidia’s GPUs first started rising when OpenAI first released ChatGPT in 2022, and OpenAI still relies on Nvidia’s AI chips to develop its software and deploy it to users.

>It also signals just how many Nvidia chips OpenAI will need in order to develop next-generation artificial intelligence that can do more than its current models.

>“This is monumental in size,” CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC’s Jon Fortt in an interview on Monday.

>“Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.

>In August, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call that building one gigawatt of data center capacity costs between $50 billion and $60 billion, of which about $35 billion of those costs are for Nvidia chips and systems.

>Nvidia will join a roster of investors that valued OpenAI at $500 billion in a recent secondary round. Microsoft was one of OpenAI’s early investors, and has strategic partnership with it to integrate OpenAI models into its cloud service, Azure, and Microsoft Office.""









This is quite the circular economy we got going here. By investing in the deeply unprofitable startup that buys their product, they ensure demand for their products remains strong.

Probably the right move for Nvidia, because a lot of this money will come back to them, and they can sell their hardware at high Margins. And with their stock trading at 50x earnings, it makes sense to spend their cash flow on funding/acquiring AI startups rather than buying back shares.

This all but ensures the  AI bubble keeps going a couple more years, but also inflates it even further. MAG7 is becoming more and more exposed to AI, with cash flows going towards datacenter buildout and training AI models rather than innovation or shareholder returns.",596,169,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnqz79/nvidia_will_invest_up_to_100_billion_in_openai/,new,Company News,0.96

1nnpqxs,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 11:33:55,Markets And Gold Are Both Hitting ATHs. Last Time That Happened Was...,"COVID, which as a rare global event driven by a pandemic. Then, before that, in 2007. Right before it hit the fan in 2008 with the financial crisis.

Historically, gold and the markets have been divergent. When people are optimistic, they pile into the markets. When they get worried, they move into gold. It's pretty rare to see them both hitting ATHs at the same time. I am curious to hear your thoughts on this.

From my perspective, it seems all of society is bifurcated right now on just about everything. We have a large group of Chicken Little's, that think this is all going to blow up in our faces any day now. Even Warren/Berkshire is holding a record amount of cash and more T-Bills that the Treasury itself ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/why-warren-buffett-s-berkshire-hathaway-now-owns-more-treasury-bills-than-the-federal-reserve-11807572)). Conversely, we seem to have an equal size group of Pollyanna's that think we are entering into some sort of golden age and manage to find a silver lining in every bit of news (pun intended). I am somewhat agnostic and think both groups are not seeing things too clearly. At the end of the day, it is the optimistic crowd that drives the markets and set the prices. If they keep thinking they are getting a good deal and remain willing buy what the others are selling, and they believe in it enough to hold, then the markets will just keep going up or possibly plateau for a while until some external event drives them in either direction.

There is lots of money going into specific buckets right now, such as AI and crypto, which is also hitting ATHs. I have no idea what people think they will do with the stupid amount of money flowing into crypto and its offshoot financial products (other than trying to make a quick buck). And I think all the AI plays will take much longer to shake out and find the winners and losers than most people think (like the dot-com era). I view AI stocks with mind numbing P/Es, precious metals, and crypto as all something investors would need a high level of conviction and a buy-and-hold mindset to buy into right now at these levels. And I question how much conviction is really there.

With both groups (Chicken Little's and Pollyanna's) buying into both sides of fear and optimism, it seems like every scenario is priced in. It's like a double bubble face-off that just keeps growing, just waiting for something to happen. Even if more geopolitical turmoil erupts and/or inflation starts ticking back up with high unemployment, are people really going to buy in more to precious metals when they are at ATHs already? Without hitting the bottom line in spectacular fashion, is there any development that can get AI more hyped and inflated while we wait for it to generate a real ROI somewhere? And what if nothing happens at all and things more-or-less stay the same economically and geopolitically?",993,343,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnpqxs/markets_and_gold_are_both_hitting_aths_last_time/,new,Unknown,0.93

Now, the company wants a second win.

Starting on Monday, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema will hear arguments in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on how to fix Google’s monopoly over some online advertising technology. The judge ruled this year that Google had broken the law to protect its dominance over the largely invisible system of technology that places ads on pages across the web. The hearing is expected to last for two to three weeks.

The Justice Department has said it wants Google to sell the technology it uses to connect buyers and sellers of ad space, among other potential remedies. Google has instead proposed measures including changing its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers.

Judge Brinkema’s ultimate decision could disrupt the company’s $3.1 trillion business and help rewrite the playbook for tech dominance in the modern internet era.

After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

⸻

Bottom line:
Japanese real estate small caps are a rare mix of hyper-growth, low valuations, insider ownership, and secular tailwinds.

- Nuclear energy stocks are roaring upwards, sending nuclear energy speculative stocks soaring despite being loss-making, and despite no revenues in some cases (OKLO!), so it’s only a matter of time before attention turns to a high-growth, cash-generative business like Rolls Royce, which keeps announcing new deals.

- Rolls-Royce won a £2,500,000,000 deal in June to build nuclear reactors in the United Kingdom. Last week, they’ve issued a statement on it welcoming in the “Golden Age” of nuclear energy.

- Rolls-Royce builds and maintains the Nuclear reactors powering submarines.  They signed a £9,000,000,000 contract with the UK Ministry of Defence to provide long-term support for the existing fleet and future builds, securing its role in the UK's nuclear deterrent for decades to come.

- Goldman Sachs have initiated coverage of RR with a Buy rating, with a target of £12.90 /  $17.40  - recognising the turnaround story since covid, and the huge profit margin and FCF improvements in recent years.

- Citigroup have upgraded their price target to £14.40 / $19.44.
(The difference appears to be that Citigroup have recognised how massively exciting the Nuclear Energy side of the business is, whereas Goldman haven’t even mentioned it.)

- The vast majority of analysts are rating RR a buy. 
 
- Saudi Arabia Railways will be using more Rolls-Royce engines in their trains than before. Since 2012, there have been seventy 12V 4000 engines used in trains operated by Saudi Arabia Railways, and – having been impressed by their quality even in the harshest of conditions – Saudi Arabia have ordered an additional 50 trains with RR engines, as announced a month ago.

Sure I’ve missed so many things there as all the many divisions of Rolls-Royce seems to be on turbo charge at the moment.

With aviation demand rising (and especially from Airbus more than Boeing),  with defence spending rising, and with the growing and desperate need for more sustainable energy solutions from nuclear, etc etc, it is inevitable that Rolls-Royce will be announcing more deals on all fronts in the coming weeks and months.  
[…and it can only help to be having dinner with the Trump and Starmer last week!]

On this basis, I believe we will £20 within the next 12 months =  74% higher than we are here.  And longer term it’ll be multiples of where it is today. And it is all backed up by solid real results - real revenues, real profit, and real deals worth billions.

Russia’s control of oil supply could send gas prices soaring but what about the economic impact from Eastern Europe at war?

We haven’t really had a large scale war since WW2 so we don’t have recent examples to go off of except maybe around 9/11 and the beginning of war in the Middle East but that doesn’t affect global markets like a war in Europe would.

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley’s are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley’s. When economic conditions are rough, there’s not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn’t be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been sharply declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is “motorcycles are dangerous”. Anyone who rides motorcycles, knows someone who has been injured or killed on a bike. It is not very uncommon in the community.

6. The overall state of the market makes me nervous. Everything’s great until it isn’t and I want to have a hedge against a potential downturn in the market. I think this company would be more heavily affected than anything else I could choose from.

Historically, for the insiders this returns 910% since 2019! (53 purchases, final total amt. invested of 7754$ in my fake portfolio)

Recently, this past week, I can see that insiders are starting to average in again (you can see this on any site that tracks this kind of stuff, Form 4s).

UAA market cap is down to just over $2 billion! Kevin Plank, founder & CEO, is focused on rebuilding the brand.

1nm567c,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 14:07:12,The Future of RDDT Stock,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.

This deviation could be a setup for an October treat that leads to a strong fourth quarter.

**iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF** **(TLT)**:  This long-term Treasury bond has gained price appreciation over the past month from the expected and subsequent federal interest rate cut this past Wednesday.  It is moving higher along with stocks from the interest rate cut, with two more likely rate cuts before the end of this year.  It peaked at $172.25 on Aug 6th, 2020, and has never gone below $80 for the past 23 years.  The Treasury Bond ETFs do not have the price action of stocks and other ETFs, but it is also less risky with a limited bottom and a significantly higher monthly dividend yield. Yields from Treasury Bond ETFs are subject to federal tax, but are exempt from state and local taxes. 

**SPDR Gold Shares (GLD):**  Gold has hit an ATH without much hype and is likely to benefit from the upcoming multiple interest rate cuts.

**Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS):**  This ETF has up 20% since June and shows that money continues to flow into dominant cloud, AI, and digital infrastructure.  The price appreciation of Magnificent 7 is pointing to a supercycle that will likely lead to one of the strongest fourth quarters.

1nltilf,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 05:16:54,Indian Market Data Shows ESG Scores Flip Normal Price Discovery Rules,"Market mechanics just got weird. A recent analysis of Indian stocks shows that companies split into two trading patterns purely based on their ESG ratings:

* High ESG companies → spot market leads futures (completely backwards from normal).
* Low ESG companies → futures market leads spot (as expected).

Futures are supposed to lead because they’re cheaper and more efficient. Yet somehow, ESG flips the script.

What’s wilder: the effect isn’t uniform.

* Banking & IT → bidirectional causality, no matter the ESG score.
* Cement, oil & gas, pharma → high ESG firms drove spot-led discovery.
* FMCG & autos → low ESG firms showed futures-led dynamics.

My take: post-COVID inflows into good companies might have made spot trading hypersensitive, leaving futures lagging. For traders, it suggests that ESG leaders vs. laggards, the traditional playbook won't work.

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I’m doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I’ve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I’ve never had much of a strategy, I’ve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I’ve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in “core” growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in “moonshots” like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. 

The issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max. 

I struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I’m up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there.

1nlrvhd,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 03:31:36,Bears only hope remaining to maul the bulls,"I am not a bear or a bull I am bullish but alot more cautious than most and wont fomo into some of the stocks I have been watching as I know its a dangerous time when people think the market is easy.
Anyway bears have been slaughtered recently and perma bulls are making money and most people are in the delusional stage of the rally and see no way down. 
Whilst this is unlikely I can seen one major way in which the market could turn ugly, its a black swan event so unlikely but its always good to account for black swans as they have a disproportionate negative impact.
I think energy prices mainly oil and gas are low right now and thus support the fed when it comes to their expansionary monetary policy, cutting rates to boost the job market and stocks love that. However, if we were to get a supply side shock because of one of a number of reasons such as an escalating war then this would mean inflation would become rampant like in the 70s and the fed would have to raise rates or create a class war or major social unrest. At the minimum they could not cut anymore, this seems unlikely and is not a prediction but any reason for a significant spike in inflation which has already been high since Covid would be the bears last hope.
It would tank the market imo or cause some if the worse violence and social problems since 1929 and the rise if the far right.
Something like this is not likely now but in Europe or the Us I can see something like this being fairly probable in the next 3 or 4 years in an already vulnerable underlining economy.

Just to clarify not a prediction, more something to start debate on potential causes of high inflation and a stock crash or alternatively if you think there is another factor at play more likely to stop fed easing and cause a major slow down.

I know they have that $24.5B ATM shelf open, which means they can issue more shares basically any time. Based on some modeling I did, here’s what another raise might look like:
	•	If they raise $2B at $60/share, that’s roughly 33M new shares → about 15% dilution.
	•	If price tanks to $30 and they raise $2B, that’s 66M shares → closer to 30% dilution (way worse).
	•	If price rips to $100 and they raise $2B, it’s only 7.5% dilution (pretty mild).

Historically, they tend to announce raises when share price + ETH price are strong so I’d expect the next dilution within the next 3–6 months if conditions stay favorable.

My big fear is: if they hit us with a big raise and the market sells off, this could easily drop to $55 or even $49 support levels fast.

1nlf722,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 16:54:37,"SPT Sprout Social - Big upside move ahead, AI and Social Media","Hi everyone,

with this post I want to introduce the company Sprout Social (Nasdaq: SPT) and explain why, in my view, buying the stock could pay off over the mid to long term.

**1) About Sprout Social:**  
Sprout Social, Inc. is a U.S.-based provider of cloud software for social media management. From one central platform you can schedule and publish posts, handle comments and messages, run performance analytics, and monitor social conversations. Sprout Social serves roughly 30,000 customers in 100+ countries and is among the leaders in this space. The business model is Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with recurring subscription revenue.

Sprout Social was founded in 2010 and went public in 2019. Headquarters are in Chicago, with offices in Seattle, Dublin, and Kraków, among others. The company currently employs over 1,300 people worldwide and has received multiple awards for its products and customer satisfaction (including #1 Best Software Product 2024 according to G2).

Market cap: 0.84 billion (Prior year: 1.6 billion, -47.5%)  
Revenue: 0.45 billion FY 2025 (Prior year: 0.4 billion, +12.5%)

**2) Risks (just Sprout specific, of course there are more overall)**  
\- Sprout Social still reports GAAP losses of 57 million in 2024. However, it operates profitably on a non-GAAP basis. If Sprout fails to manage costs effectively, particularly in areas like sales, marketing, and research and development, or if it cannot accelerate revenue growth, the path to full profitability may be delayed.

\- The declining market cap is a consequence of the lack of GAAP profitability and the slowdown in revenue growth over the past few months.

\- SBC: The company reports non-GAAP profits despite reporting GAAP losses due to a high amount. At least the SBC rate has remained stable: Q2/2025 reported SBC expenses of $20.2 million, which is almost unchanged from the prior year ($20.6 million). Additionally, SBC’s total expenses for the first half of 2025 were just under $40 million, compared to $38.7 million in the prior year.

**3) Opportunities**  
\- In the era of AI, data scale plays a crucial role. Sprout Social, for instance, connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this data scale.

\- Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance.

\- Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.

**4) Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:**  
\- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

\- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

\- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.

1nl7vt4,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 12:14:02,Jerome Powell on the labor market and why they chose to cut rates,"All direct quotes from the fed meeting:


“In the labor market, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August but remains little changed over the past year at a relatively low level. Payroll job gains have slowed significantly to a pace of just 29 thousand per month over the past three months. A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force, due to lower immigration and lower labor force participation. Even so, labor demand has softened and the recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the “breakeven” rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. In addition, wage growth has continued to moderate while still outpacing inflation. Overall, the marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers is unusual. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. In our SEP, the median projection for the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and edges down thereafter.
Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the Consumer Price Index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent. These readings are higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up. In contrast, disinflation appears to be continuing for services. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about tariffs, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.0 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent in 2026 and to 2.1 percent in 2027.
Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4-1/4 percent and to continue reducing the size of our balance sheet.“

1nl2uoj,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 08:57:26,$CDTX: H5 bird flu results are in,"Yesterday I flagged that the results from a study to evaluate in vivo efficacy of Cidara's CD388 pre-exposure prophylaxis against H5N1 (bird flu) would be presented today at the ISRV conference in Singapore. The results are now out ( [A single prophylactic dose of CD388  provides protection against highly  pathogenic bovine-origin Influenza  A virus in the ferret model](https://www.cidara.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ISRV-2025-Cidara-CD388_H5N1_Andreevl-FINAL.pdf)).  The study results were presented by Konstantin Andreev, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

**Key findings:**

This is the first in-vivo demonstration of CD388 against H5, building on prior in-vitro data.

In the ferret model (the gold standard for flu):

\***A single prophylactic dose protected against lethal H5 challenge.**

\* ≥10 mg/kg = 100% protection, with dose-response observed (3 mg/kg = 75%, 1 mg/kg = 25%).

\*Treated animals showed reduced weight loss, fewer symptoms, and no systemic spread or neuroinvasion.

\*CD388 also reduced viral shedding and cleared virus from the upper respiratory tract by Day 9.

**Why it matters:**

\*Confirms CD388’s potential as a **true pan-influenza prophylaxis**, not just seasonal.

\*Strengthens the **pandemic preparedness** story.  This is the type of data BARDA and other governments look for when deciding on stockpiling/contract awards.

\*Reinforces the idea that CD388 carries **strategic “insurance value”** on top of its seasonal high-risk market.

 

**Next milestones to watch:**

1.      End-of-Phase 2b FDA minutes (expected shortly): Looking for confirmation of an accelerated Fall ’25 Phase 3 start vs. planned spring 2026 base case.  May also confirm if Ph2b counts as pivotal, allowing for shorter phase 3. News on  Breakthrough Therapy Designation could also be included.

2.      BARDA decision on grant application.  CEO has said a decision is expected by year-end (unclear if fiscal or calendar). This is the next potential big non-dilutive funding catalyst.

**Bottom line:** Seasonal flu alone supports my conservative $445 (!) share rNPV. With H5 protection confirmed in vivo, CD388 is positioned not just as a seasonal prophylaxis but as a potential pandemic countermeasure, which  strengthens the case for BARDA funding and stockpiling.

Earlier this week, President Donald Trump proposed the idea that companies should no longer provide earnings reports on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead. The SEC said the agency is actively looking into that plan.

“At President Trump’s request, Chairman \[Paul\] Atkins and the SEC is prioritizing this proposal to further eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies,” an agency spokesperson said earlier.

1nl1f0l,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 07:50:52,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",113,56,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,new,Industry Discussion,0.89

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1nksav5,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 23:00:45,UPS Has A Limited Downside From This Price,"United Parcel Service (UPS) $85

**Industry/Sector/Type –  – – Transportation/Goods/Cyclical** 

Biggest catalyst for the stock – High dividend yield and low valuation, scraping the bottom of the barrel for “value” stocks. Cautious buy, expecting a limited downside.

**Positives**

**Low Valuation:** United Parcel Service trades at a decade-low valuation of 12x earnings, which doesn’t give enough credit to its pivot from low-margin Amazon volumes towards higher-value customers. I believe that in a few years, UPS should improve operating margins significantly from the current 9% to about 12% with better paying customers.

**Healthcare logistics market:** The healthcare logistics market is estimated to grow at 9-10% to $82Bn, and UPS has plans to double revenues from this segment to $20Bn by 2026. This is a significantly higher valued market with a lot of specialized functions - storage, handling, and time-sensitive transportation, essential when you're delivering medicine, biologics, and medical devices. The $87Bn UPS has a competitive advantage over smaller carries, because it has a lot of infrastructure in place - such as temperature-controlled storage in several locations to cater this industry from clinical trials to patient deliveries. The best part of course, premium pricing. 

**Cost cutting and operational improvements:**  Here are the key points of UPS $3.5B cost reduction program:

* Reducing 20,000 jobs in 2025, across operations and management, with voluntary buyouts.
* Closing 73 facilities as part of a broader consolidation.
* Automating 64% of operations.
* 35% of reductions will come from operational roles, and 30% from Capex.
* Consolidating package routes.
* Raising revenue per piece by dropping less-profitable customers and increasing rates on retained volume

**Negatives**

**Under performer** – In the past decade the stock has lost 14%, with a very high percentage of Amazon’s business, which hurt margins. It has fallen significantly off a high of $203 from 2022. 

**Lack of forward guidance** – turnaround efforts have flattered to only deceive, two recent examples, it pulled its 2025 revenue and profit outlook in April and again withheld from providing targets in July. 

**Tariff uncertainty**  – the US-China trade being a key contributor to the lack of clarity. The demise of the de minimis exclusion of merchandise below $800 from tariffs is hurting UPS.

**Valuation**

After 15% and 4% earnings and revenues drops in 2025, I do expect UPS to return to 10-11% earnings growth and 2-4% revenue growth for the next 3 years.

A market cap of just $71Bn against $87Bn in sales is attractive. Add to that a historically low P/E of 12, and a dividend yield of 7.5%,

**High yield** – its dividend yield of 7.5% looks safe for now. **This a cautious buy.** The only caveat is that we still have a lot of trade uncertainty, and if the turnaround takes longer, this could fall even further, but I believe the downside is limited from here.

* **CD388 has already shown in-vitro activity against H5**. Tomorrow’s readout is **in-vivo.**   If results are good, that’s additional proof of **broad, pan-influenza prophylaxis** beyond just seasonal strains.
* Governments care about (and pay for!) **pandemic preparedness**. Positive H5 data could bolster the case for BARDA stockpiling, the next potential big non-dilutive funding catalyst for Cidara.

My baseline rNPV ([CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)) only accounts for seasonal high-risk cohorts in High Income Countries (HICs).

Strong H5 data increases the probability of **optional upside** :  
• Pandemic preparedness contracts (BARDA, ex-U.S. stockpiles).  
• A strong pandemic countermeasure story supports the strategic “insurance value” of CD388 and could lead to a reduction in the “skepticism discount” that seems to be currently applied to the asset.

The results won’t change my conservative base case on valuation right away, but it adds meaningful **optionality that isn’t included in my model yet**.

1nk3147,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 04:48:13,$APLD DD AI Datacenters huge run from $3 --> $20 since April,"I think $APLD  deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story. 

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.  
  
Not financial advice. Just my DD.

1njy059,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 23:42:38,Zillow Will Benefit Strongly From A Housing Rebound,"**Zillow (Z) $90.75,  Planning to add tomorrow morning**

**Industry/Sector/Type - - - Housing Marketplace/Platform/Steady growth tied to housing cyclicality.**

**Biggest catalyst for the stock** \- If interest/mortgage rates keep reducing and housing bottoms out, this could be a better way to play the housing rebound. It’s asset light, a market leader with a lot of scale and has emerged much stronger in the housing sector decline.

The great fight against inflation, which saw the Fed funds rate shoot up from 0.25% to over 5% in a short 16 months from March 22 to July 2023 felled the overbought, overpriced housing industry, which is still struggling to recover two years after its peak. Existing home and new home sales peaked around Q1-2022 at 6.1Mn and 1Mn units respectively. Now, they’re down 33% to 37% from that peak to just 4Mn and 625K units. **However, prices have dropped only 5% to 7% from their respective peaks and at a 6.5% mortgage rate continues to be a severe impediment to any kind of a rebound.**  
But if the housing market rebounds as housing cycles normally do with lower interest rates, I think Zillow would be a great way to take advantage of it.

**What’s positive about Zillow?**  
**Market leadership** \- dominant online buying and rental platform, with over 60% market share.  Zillow's housing app makes it the most visited real estate site in the US, with an estimated 243M Monthly unique users over its various platforms, with its engagement levels several notches above its competitors.

**Rental revenue** \- Rentals are now 25% of revenues, growing at 36%. With housing increasing unaffordable for younger cohorts, Zillow's has focused on rental demand by building a multiple listing service (MLS) on steroids. Its largest supply comes from multi-family landlords, growing at 45%. Its scale, reach and heft give it operating leverage even with lower revenue growth,  growing revenue per user and better conversion rates than smaller competitors. Zillow also gets high margin ancillary revenue from after-market services, such as title, mortgage financing, and escrow services.

**Beating the industry** \- Its For-Sale business is still growing even as new and existing home sales continue to decline.  
**Earnings growth** of over 30% expected with 14% revenue growth in the next three years.  
**Strong earnings momentum** \- beat in the first two quarters of 2025.  
**Lower mortgage rates could goose housing** \- with labor markets weakening, I believe that the 25 basis point cut is the start of declining interest rates, which would give the moribund housing industry a decent boost. I now believe that Zillow is a better long-term option than homebuilders to play housing at much lower risk.

**Zillow had wasted a significant amount of money, time and resources with its first-party home-flipping business, which they exited. Thank God! That was a disaster.**

**Negatives, challenges and risks**

**Housing cycle needs to recover** \- Poor existing, and new home sales, combined with still high prices and mortgage rates suggest that the housing cycle still has a long way to recovery.

**Stock could remain range bound** \- The stock has been on a tear gaining 44% over the last 12 months, much of the first two quarter’s earnings growth could be priced in.

**Stagnant housing market** \- A stagnant housing market has resulted in poor listing volume and even fewer transactions.

**Cyclical industry** \- It cannot escape housing cycles.

**Prices still high** \- Home prices need to drop further, they’re just 5 to 7% below the 2022 peak.

**The dispute with Compass could derail growth** \- The large real estate brokerage platform, Compass’ use of private “pocket listings,” reduces the availability of listings on Zillow’s site, attacking Zillow’s business strategy of aggregating the largest number of listings. Should this practice continue with other brokerages, the business will fragment, diminishing Zillow’s appeal as having the the largest inventory of listings.

To be sure with the 44% rally, the stock is already priced at 39x 2026 earnings, growing at 30%, with a forward PEG of 1.3, Similarly it quotes 7x 2026 sales growing at 14%. Not terrible, but no longer cheap either.

1njv8wk,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 21:26:21,Mark Zuckerberg unveils $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses,"Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display.

The glasses, which costs $799, contain a small digital display that can be controlled via hand gestures through a wristband powered by neural technology, confirming a CNBC report in August. A promotional video of the new smart glasses appeared on Meta’s YouTube page on Monday but was later removed.

The new smart glasses are a bridge between the company’s audio-only Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and the experimental Orion augmented reality glasses that the company revealed at last year’s Connect event. Orion can overlay 3D visuals over a person’s real-world field of view with the help of a wireless computing puck, but the glasses are expensive to make and not yet available to consumers.

The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses come with the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that allows users to control the device using hand gestures.

“These are glasses with the classic style that you’d expect from Ray-Ban, but they’re the first AI glasses with a high resolution display and a fully weighted Meta neural band,” Zuckerberg said.

With the new glasses, people can do tasks like watch videos through the display or see and respond to text messages, Zuckerberg said. The display doesn’t block a person’s view, and it disappears when not being used, he said.

The glasses go on sale in the U.S. on Sept. 30.

The company on Wednesday also debuted the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses, intended for athletes who participate in high-intensity sports like snowboarding and mountain biking. The Oakley-branded glasses will cost $499 when they launch on Oct. 21, making it $100 more expensive than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses that went on sale in June.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses have a sportier look than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses thanks to a wraparound design that extends its colorful lenses around a person’s temples. Unlike the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, the new model contains a button on the underside of its frames so that athletes who wear helmets can more easily capture photos and videos.

The new sports-centric smart glasses have up to nine hours of battery life, can capture 3K video and contain speakers that are louder than their predecessors. The glasses can connect with Garmin-branded fitness watches to track certain stats like their heart rates using the Meta AI assistant. Preorders start today.

Meta also debuted the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the latest version of the company’s original smart glasses. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) costs $379, up from $299 for the version released in 2023. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) has double the battery life of the previous model, lasting 8 hours on a single charge, and a more powerful camera that can capture 3K Ultra HD video. The new glasses go on sale today.

Zuckerberg also announced Horizon TV, pitching it as a way to watch television shows, sporting events and movies using the company’s Quest VR headsets. Some of Meta’s partners who will be contributing content to the app include Disney and Universal Pictures, Zuckerberg said.

>Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.

>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen.

>In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4‑1/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Austan D. Goolsbee; Philip N. Jefferson; Alberto G. Musalem; Jeffrey R. Schmid; and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action was Stephen I.

1. Uber just invested 300 million dollars to partner with Lucid on a 20,000 unit robotaxi fleet built on the Gravity SUV platform. This is a huge validation of both Gravity and Lucid’s tech, with the first launch planned in the US next year
2. Saudi PIF backing is still solid which means financial support is not going away
3. The Gravity SUV launch on the consumer side adds another growth angle beyond the Air sedan
4. EV names often move together. Any rally in Tesla, Rivian or the sector can give Lucid a sympathy lift
5. Cost cutting has started to show up in the financials and management is working on margins
6. The reverse split has already played out and most weak holders are gone which reduces negative sentiment
7. Lucid is no longer trading like a penny stock which means bigger institutions can step in
8. Central bank policy leaning more dovish supports high growth names like Lucid by lowering funding pressure

The reality is uranium is in seriously short supply.,"Obviously this ban (actually the Chinese government telling Chinese companies to avoid NVIDIA's AI chips) is bringing down NVIDIA stocks today. But it looks like it is also affecting Uranium and Nuclear. Sprott and VanEck Uranium/Nuclear ETFs are down up to a half percent as I type this, for example. However, this ""instruction"" by the Chinese government *does not affect the building boom of data centres in the western world*. These data centres are still being built at a record pace in America and elsewhere.

Consider first that it is recognized that there is impending uranium shortage because of this data centre building boom and widely predicted energy shortage. There is simply not enough uranium being mined and processed today to keep up with a very real future demand.

And on top of this, there is a growing understanding that a more reliable and 'green' source of stable power is required for the next 50 years or so, until 'renewable' energy can do this. Currently green can definitely supply large amounts of power, but the stability at grid scale is still a work in progress.

Nuclear is in such high demand, that even retired nuclear generating stations are being refurbished and brought back online. And at least 5 countries in Europe are either extending the lives of current reactors, and/or are also building new ones.

Even Canada is upping its nuclear game. A sure sign that nuclear is winning, over purely wind and solar solutions. It is expanding its nuclear capacity. The Bruce Generating Station in Ontario has almost completed adding two new reactors, which will make it once again the largest nuclear generating station in the world. And Ontario's Darlington nuclear generating station (currently with 4 reactors) will be adding 4 new SMRs which was just announced by the PM. And Alberta is looking seriously at building a nuclear generating station. If Canada is doing this, nuclear is mainstream.

It is expected that an announcement can happen at the annual meeting in a couple of weeks on Sep 30 or even announced earlier.

the reason why Warren outperforms the market & loves insurance, is because insurers reinvests their profits. For Warren & Geico, they rolled their profits & reinvest into equity, which allows them to make outsized returns. Bill Ackman wants to replicate this success.

Based on his vision, a P&C insurer is his most likely choice, as reserve requirements are low which allows for reinvestment and it also follows the Geico playbook pretty well.

LMND mcap is too high(4.2B), HIPO mcap is too small & unprofitable, ROOT makes sense(1.5B) but management has always mentioned that they wanted to grow ROOT to be larger than PGR, so that is likely out of the pic, as ROOT takes the solo approach.

I do not see Bill investing in health insurance due to his past criticism of UNH. Nor is he investing in life insurance due to the higher reserve requirements. Speciality insurance is also too niched with less TAM. Also many MGA's have terrible balance sheets with negative tangible equity (GSHD, RYAN, TWFG, etc)

1nj9v93,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 06:54:22,China bans tech companies from buying Nvidia’s AI chips,"     China’s internet regulator has banned the country’s biggest technology companies from buying Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips, as Beijing steps up efforts to boost its domestic industry and compete with the US.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) told companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s tailor-made product for the country, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Several companies had indicated they would order tens of thousands of the RTX Pro 6000D, and had started testing and verification work with Nvidia’s server suppliers, the people said.

After receiving the CAC order, the companies told their suppliers to stop the work, the people added.

The ban goes beyond earlier guidance from regulators that focused on the H20, Nvidia’s other China-only chip widely used for AI. It comes after Chinese regulators concluded that domestic chips had attained performance comparable to those of Nvidia’s models used in China.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, told reporters in London on Wednesday that he expected to discuss the chipmaker’s ability to do business in China with Donald Trump that evening during the US president’s state visit to the UK.

“We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,” he said. “I’m disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I’m understanding of that. We are patient about it.” 

Beijing is putting pressure on Chinese tech companies to boost the country’s homegrown semiconductor industry and break their reliance on Nvidia so it can compete in an AI race against the US.

“The message is now loud and clear,” said an executive at one of the tech companies. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it’s all hands on deck to build the domestic system.”

Nvidia started producing chips tailored for the Chinese market after former US President Joe Biden banned the company from exporting its most powerful products to China, in an effort to rein in Beijing’s progress on AI.

Beijing’s regulators have recently summoned domestic chipmakers such as Huawei and Cambricon, as well as Alibaba and search engine giant Baidu, which also make their own semiconductors, to report how their products compare against Nvidia’s China chips, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.

They concluded that China’s AI processors had reached a level comparable to or exceeding that of the Nvidia products allowed under export controls, the person added.

China says Nvidia violated antitrust law when it bought Mellanox

The Financial Times reported last month that China’s chipmakers were seeking to triple the country’s total output of AI processors next year.

“The top-level consensus now is there’s going to be enough domestic supply to meet demand without having to buy Nvidia chips,” said an industry insider.

Nvidia introduced the RTX Pro 6000D in July during Huang’s visit to Beijing, when the US company also said Washington was easing its previous ban on the H20 chip.

China’s regulators, including the CAC, have warned tech companies against buying Nvidia’s H20, asking them to justify having purchased them over domestic products, the FT reported last month.

The RTX Pro 6000D, which the company has said could be used in automated manufacturing, was the last product Nvidia was allowed to sell in China in significant volumes.

Alibaba, ByteDance, the CAC and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1nirgbf,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 15:37:42,Microsoft announces $30 billion investment in AI infrastructure in UK,"Microsoft said on Tuesday that it plans to invest $30 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.K. by 2028.

The investment includes $15 billion in capital expenditures and $15 billion in its U.K. operations, Microsoft said. The company said the investment would enable it to build the U.K.’s “largest supercomputer,” with more than 23,000 advanced graphics processing units, in partnership with Nscale, a British cloud computing firm.

The spending commitment comes as President Donald Trump embarks on a state visit to Britain. Trump arrived in the U.K. Tuesday evening and is set to be greeted at Windsor Castle on Wednesday by King Charles and Queen Camilla.

During his visit, all eyes are on U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is under pressure to bring stability to the country after the exit of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over a house tax scandal and a major cabinet reshuffle.

On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said his stance on the U.K. has warmed over the years. He previously criticized the country over its attempt in 2023 to block the tech giant’s $69 billion acquisition of video game developer Activision-Blizzard. The deal was cleared by the U.K.s competition regulator later that year.

“I haven’t always been optimistic every single day about the business climate in the U.K.,” Smith said. However, he added, “I am very encouraged by the steps that the government has taken over the last few years.”

“Just a few years ago, this kind of investment would have been inconceivable because of the regulatory climate then and because there just wasn’t the need or demand for this kind of large AI investment,” Smith said.

Starmer and Trump are expected to sign a new deal Wednesday “to unlock investment and collaboration in AI, Quantum, and Nuclear technologies,” the government said in a statement late Tuesday.

Yes, if you bought during or before 2021 you likely are still down. However, if you held your nose and bought when it was trading at dirt cheap prices during Feb 2024 you’re probably pretty happy right now.

The best time to buy is when everyone says “this is Uninvestable.” For example, I think stocks like MOH and CNC could have a lot of upside, maybe some REITs like ARE or MPW have value too. 

And yes, I am well aware of the VIE structure of the BABA ADR. It is certainly a risk, but all investing comes with risk, you just need to ensure that you’re well compensated for the risk you’re taking. If it scares you, consider FXI which owns shares on the Hong Kong exchange. Full disclosure I own that too, as well as TCEHY. 

Next time someone on reddit says that you should avoid a heavily beaten down sector, consider buying.

The program came out of a June executive order and sets up controlled trial environments under DOT and FAA oversight. Archer will work with airlines (United is already backing them) and cities to show that its Midnight aircraft can fly quietly, safely, and at scale.

CEO Adam Goldstein called it a *“landmark moment,”* while United’s CFO said flying taxis could reshape how people move through congested cities. The trials could start as early as next year, with data feeding into certification and future expansion.

ACHR has already had a wild run this year (up over 150% YoY), but this adds another layer of federal legitimacy. Analysts keep slapping buy ratings with $13 PTs, even after the stock’s volatility.

**The bigger question:**

- Are we seeing the real start of urban air mobility, or is this just another news-fueled pump before a long wait on certification?

- Can these fleets actually scale like ridesharing, or will costs/noise/local politics kill it?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1nhxe5d,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 16:36:29,EchoStar (SATS) seems massively undervalued after the $17B SpaceX deal,"I look at EchoStar (SATS), and I see something very interesting. A big thing happened and I think many people do not see the real story. I think maybe the price is too low now.

So, this company had a very big problem. It had too much debt. Like a huge credit card bill that is hard to pay. But then, they sell something very valuable. They sell their invisible highways for phone signals, what people call spectrum. First, they sell some to AT&T for $23 billion. Then, they sell more to SpaceX, the Elon Musk company, for $17 billion. That is so much money. With this money, they can pay all the debt. The big problem is gone.

The deal with SpaceX is very special. EchoStar did not just get cash. They get $8.5 billion in cash, and also an $8.5 billion piece of the SpaceX company. So now, EchoStar owns a part of SpaceX. This is very exciting, because SpaceX is growing very fast with its Starlink internet from satellites.
So what is EchoStar company now? It is not the same company it was before. Before, they were trying to build a big new 5G phone network all by themselves. This was very risky and was costing so much money. Now, they stopped that plan. The company is now more simple. It is a company that just owns a few other businesses. It is much safer now.

Think of it like a box with different toys inside. What is in the box?

First, there is the TV business, with DISH and Sling. This part is getting smaller, but it still makes a lot of money, like a cash machine.

Second, the phone business, Boost Mobile. It is smaller now and will use towers from other companies. But it will have a special new power: it will use the Starlink satellites from SpaceX so customers can get signal even in the middle of nowhere.

Third, an internet business called Hughes. This part is very stable and sells internet to government and other big companies.

Fourth, the piece of SpaceX. This is the most exciting part. It is like having a ticket for a rocket ship that is already flying to the moon. SpaceX is worth so much money, maybe $400 billion or more.

And fifth, they still have more of those invisible phone highways left to sell! One big bank said this extra part could be worth almost $10 billion. They can sell this later to a company like Verizon and get even more cash.

So, I add up all these pieces. The TV business, the phone business, the internet business, the piece of SpaceX, and the extra highways they still own. When I add it all up, I think the company is worth about $32 billion. But if you look at the stock market, the price for the whole company is only about $22 billion. This is a very big difference. It means one share of the stock could be worth maybe $110, but today it is much cheaper.

The story is simple. The company had a big debt problem. They sold some things and now the problem is gone. Now they have no debt, they have businesses that make money, and they own a piece of one of the world's most exciting companies. But the stock price is still acting like the old company with the big problem. This is why I think it is very interesting.

1nhozun,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 11:28:53,How do I (27M) convince my dad (68M) to stop gambling on individual stocks?,"My dad comfortably retired around 13 years ago from a good business he owned. He was able to build a strong nest egg to coast through retirement easily, even if he just kept it in lower-interest assets yielding 3-4% per annum.

As for me, I've began my investing journey around 3 years ago and adopted a relatively conservative approach. By this I mean I hold around

* 30% cash in high-yield accounts (3-4%)
* 20% in a retirement account (6%)
* roughly 50% in a mixture of ETFs, individual stocks and crypto. Breakdown would be:
   * 35% ETFs tracking S&P500
   * 13% individual stocks
   * 2% crypto

This entire breakdown is derived from my entire net worth, I'm debt-free and projecting retirement in my early 40s.

Now going back to my dad, we've had several conversations about stocks & investments over the years, many of which have raised strong questions from me over his investing style. Let me name a few to paint a better picture:

* He's taken a nearly $2-3 million dollar loan to invest into more stocks (paid back almost half the loan)
* Majority of his investments are individual stocks, many of which consists of penny/speculative stocks that have tanked -80% all the way to delisting.
   * Huge chunk in GoPro in 2015, still holding to today with massive losses and no plans to sell and reallocate
   * Another huge chunk in (actinium pharma), which tanked nearly 90% due to not receiving FDA approval
* Several huge investments in mutual funds with high management fees (1.5-2%) which are either loss-making and barely making meaningful returns.

I was able to get hold of his spreadsheet recently to properly review his financial situation and it's extremely alarming. From my analysis, he's holding:

* 70+ individual stocks, mostly losses
* 10+ mutual funds, mostly losses

Over the last 10 months, I've created and presented two separate presentations explaining the amount of risk he's taking. I've explained the urgency of trimming his portfolio massively and reallocating into a simple index funds / bonds and even blue-chip individual stocks instead of penny stocks.

However, he has massive sunk-cost fallacy and refuses to cut his positions. He wants to wait another 6 months despite having held some of these positions over a decade. This is despite me presenting the mathematical projections that he's almost guaranteed to continue incurring huge losses holding these duds over investing in safer assets.

Does anyone have advice? I'm appaled as to how bad the damage is and whether he'll be able to repay the loan given his age.

TLDR;

Dad lost most of retirement savings from risky assets, has a $1.6 million loan to repay.",253,243,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nhozun/how_do_i_27m_convince_my_dad_68m_to_stop_gambling/,new,Unknown,0.78

1nhof8h,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 11:07:46,"LENZ Therapeutics - A high risk, high reward biotech stock","Hello r/stocks I have a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is possibly easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read?” I was just like you when I first read that. Here is what I learned.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•Target population of the US is 128 million people

	•A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year

	•The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600

⸻

Company Financial Health: Good

	•Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•I am unable to determine if their creation of this drug is protected by some type of IP or patent

	•It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•Financial health could be pressured if they fail to scale in an economical way

	•Short Interest is 30% – it is irrelevant to my thesis on this product but something you should all be aware of

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter.

1nhnjwm,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 10:35:00,Trump advocates end to quarterly earnings reports,"President Donald Trump floated the idea Monday of companies no longer providing earnings report on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is “subject to SEC approval” and would “save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”

“Did you ever hear the statement that, ‘China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!’” Trump said.

The wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.

“In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” the pair wrote.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.

Supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.

1nhmzq8,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 10:13:32,Alphabet becomes fourth company to reach $3 trillion market cap,"Alphabet has joined the $3 trillion club.

Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company into territory occupied only by Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple.

The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust ruling by a judge, whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year a district court ruled that the company held an illegal monopoly in search and related advertising.

But Judge Amit Mehta decided against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President Donald Trump congratulated the company and called it “a very good day.”

Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared to the 15% gain for the Nasdaq.

The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google’s IPO and a little more than 10 years after of the creation of Alphabet as a holding company, with Google its prime subsidiary. .

CEO Sundar Pichai was named CEO of Alphabet in 2019, replacing co-founder Larry Page. Pichai’s latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through while also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up helping Google land the recent favorable antitrust ruling. The company’s hopes of becoming a major AI player largely ride with Gemini, Google’s flagship suite of AI models.

1ngvvff,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 12:33:24,Why Par Technology Corp is a LT Buy.,"Hey Everyone,

I came across this company while reading a partnership letter of an asset management firm that allocates capital in various securities. Naturally, I was curious to learn more about it, and low and behold, it was severely undervalued with great underlying economics and management that has made decisions that have kept the company alive and is positioning itself for the future very well.

For background PAR started as a defense company and made its way into the food industry firstly offering hardware solutions, like POS items, and in the last seven years undergoing a rapid transformation into a more cloud based solutions within the food industry. The security is undervalued due to net losses in the last seven years, this is because of the rapid transformation of the company into a primary software solutions provider, which has included many acqustions to position the company to offer a unified experience from Point of sale, to payements, to commerce. Hence in recent years the company has under gone volitality from the market, yet is is important to not net loss has dramtically reduced from around 70 million in 2023 to just 5 million net loss in 24, this aligns with strong revenue growth, year over year. Management has proved that it can adapt with the moving times something that kills great companies like Kodak as a major example. (Or perhaps severely weaken their market share.) I am acknowledging that saying that profitability in the near future is speculation, but all trends point in that way. (I will attach a summary of financials below.)

The balance sheet is strong as well as assets fully outweigh liablities and the assets include the companies they acquired equating to the goodwill, and 200 million in cash as well.

They also have great business advantages, primarily the fact that companies face high switching costs once they integrate. This is more relevant than ever since PAR is offering unified experiences. This can somewhat be applied with pricing power as well.

The margin of safety is there, although it is rather hard to make predictions for growth, even conservatively, the margin of safety is quite large, i have bought at 44 a share.

Compass is a tech forward real estate brokerage. the thesis is that if interest rates drop, that real estate volume will pick back up. Josh also sees similarities to Redfin where another company can come in to acquire compass for synergies. Their profit margins are higher than other brokers, due to the tech support that compass provides to their agents. Compass has 33,000+ agents.

Weis Markets operates a chain of supermarkets with over 200 stores. Currently has a 1.75B market cap. Currently runs at a 17.64 P/E. has steady growth in assets, revenue, and offers a dividend. The thought behind this, is buying Weis in thoughts of it becoming the next Walmart. Though, growth hasn't been strong enough to support the thesis.

It’s basically a Luxembourg-based satellite outfit running the Astra satellites + O3b stuff. What’s kinda dope is they’re not just GEO like the old guys but also got a MEO constellation, so the latency’s lower and coverage’s wider than some of the newer LEO kids.

Money-wise it’s a bit of a mixed bag tbh. Revenues are in the billions € but profits are meh. They just finished buying Intelsat which could be a huge deal if they don’t mess up the integration. Dividend’s juicy at \~7% but obviously that comes with risk – heavy capex, debt, Starlink breathing down their neck etc.

1ngujqq,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 11:42:16,Mag 7: exposure to AI downside,"Hi everyone,

A quick question: out of the Mag 7, which do you think have the largest and lowest downside potential in case AI does not turn out to be the goldmine many think/thought it could be?

There are increasing concerns around the current version of AI (LLMs) being limited and not able to reach AGI (see, for instance, Yann Lecun’s take on it), coupled with concerns around monetisation (or, at least, monetisation in a scale compatible with providing good returns on the huge capital being invested), hence my question.

I think Nvidia is the top loser in that scenario, and Tesla the least exposed. Not sure about the other ones.

Thank you!

1ngogkq,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 07:06:03,Stock buybacks--Why are they happening and what do they imply for regular investors?,"I just saw that companies are buying back their own stock at a record pace, and this activity represented 6 times the volume of households buying in the market in 2024.  This is mind-blowing, and I can see a few ways to take it.  Also, I might be missing the point or the info might be misleading.  For example, how did they count my money managed by Vanguard or whoever in my 401k?

1-It could mean that the companies think their own stocks are drastically undervalued, and that might imply that despite measures like P/E ratio sending us the signal that the market is overvalued, the people in the know see it differently.  However, counter-intuitively, the chart I found showed that buybacks were lowest in the 2008 crash and the covid drop.  Those are the times that the companies' management should have seen their stocks as undervalued.  Maybe they were too focused on survival at that point to find the cash for buybacks(?) 

2-It could imply that they are using the buyback strategy as a substitute for investing in the future of their companies.  Perhaps they are trying to get the price up to catch a bonus, to increase the value of their own holdings, or just to give shareholders good feelings about their management as they see the price go up.

3-It could imply that the managers of these companies see few opportunities for investment, and they are just 'circling the airport', waiting for opportunities to come along in the future.  Maybe this could mean that a crash is likely in the near future.

Am I correct to think that today's levels of buybacks are unprecedented?  What is driving them?  What do they imply that rational individual investors should do in response, if anything?",13,98,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngogkq/stock_buybackswhy_are_they_happening_and_what_do/,new,Unknown,0.61

1nfl6jr,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 21:47:41,My thoughts on PAR.,"Hey Everyone,

So i have been looking for undervalued securities, and often you find investement ideas in niche places, from value line, to barrons, to in my case a interview with a founder of a asset management firm. The founder brought up PAR, and naturally my curiosity spiked, i went to check out the company as of now. This is will be pretty unformal so please bare with. The company has been loosing money as of late, which has relativley been the main factor in poor investor sentiment, and the whole reason the company is so undervalued in the first place. They have been loosing money primarily, because they are agressivley trying to acquire market share. PAR is a technology company that offers solutions to food businesses out of while tropical cafe and arbys are customers. I like this business because i know there are naturally high switching costs, and pricing power is strong. They have collectivley acquired different businesses from payments to commerce to really provide a unified expeirience to customers. Management competency is pretty high, Savneet Singh is the CEO and is track record is respectable to say the least. And i since the current price is at the 52 week low, it seems foolish not to put a shitload in the business, i see a long term oppurtunity, conservative dcf calculations seem to predict 10 year share prices of 110 of course this will vary individual to indiviual. So yeah for me PAR is a strong strong buy.

I bought RDDT at IPO and have been holding, because I believed in the company, and still believe that it’s a well run company with a good strategy for growth/monetization.

However, the Trump administration is putting their hands all over corporate America, and almost every large corporation is following the White House’s bidding, because no one wants to be on the wrong side of a fight with the entire federal government. Anyone that goes against the President could be faced with lawsuits, loss of contracts, having mergers/acquisitions blocked, etc. Look at how many concessions Paramount had to give the White House before their merger could be approved!

After the Charlie Kirk assassination, the American right-wing is PISSED, and swearing vengeance against “the violent left.” High ranking officials, including the President himself, are promising to root out left wing ideas. They’ve already organized extremely fast to get people and organizations investigated, suspended, and fired - https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/us/politics/charlie-kirk-shooting-firings-celebration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare

Reddit is the highest profile left-leaning social media. Multiple high profile conservatives are already angry about the highly upvoted posts that are sympathetic to the killing. Just look at the most upvoted posts yesterday on any default sub.

I think it will only be a matter of time before this sentiment about Reddit reaches the White House, and they will force Reddit to adopt changes that are favorable to the administration, such as shutting down certain subreddits, overhauling the moderation strategy, or even demanding sensitive details about certain users. If Reddit abides, it could severely impact Reddit’s growth strategy as left-leaning users find other platforms. If Reddit refuses, the administration will pursue many options to punish Reddit, like tying it up in lawsuits or preventing other companies from doing business with Reddit.

Either way, this should significantly affect Reddit stock price.

Could I be wrong and then RDDT runs up some more? Of course, but I’m already up 450% and won’t lose any sleep from selling it.",0,31,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfj3ri/why_im_selling_rddt_even_though_i_think_it_has/,new,Company Discussion,0.29
1nfgpnp,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 18:19:53,Finally leaving Robinhood after a decade,"I was part of the original batch of users when Robinhood was first teased online. Back then zero commission trading was unheard of. As a 21 year old trying to buy Tesla, logging into Scotttrade and paying commissions every single time felt like a huge barrier. Robinhood completely changed that and honestly changed the whole industry for the better.

But the app today feels very different. It has turned into a so called “super app” that constantly pushes Gold, nags you to roll over retirement accounts, and adds features that feel more like gambling than investing. The contract trading section especially just seems predatory.

I stuck with Robinhood through everything. I was not even mad during the GameStop Citadel mess when trading was locked. I defended them and even made YouTube videos back in the day recommending Robinhood to beginners.

This morning I finally moved everything to Fidelity with an ACATS transfer. I also signed up for their 2 percent cash back credit card and will funnel the rewards into index funds. At this point it just feels like the smarter move for where I am now.

Not trying to convince anyone, but after nearly a decade it feels like closing a chapter. Maybe I just grew up.


Edit: Wow, I didn’t expect so many Robinhood fans to chime in. To be clear, I was a fan too! The app just doesn’t sit right with me anymore. I’m not doing anything fancy like options these days. I’m a pretty passive investor now, mainly just buying two companies through my brokerage since my other accounts are already handling the index fund side.

> Shares of Pfizer and Moderna fell on Friday after a report that Trump administration health officials plan to link Covid vaccines to the deaths of 25 children.  The report from the Washington Post said officials plan to include the claim in a presentation next week to a key vaccine panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That committee plays a critical role in determining vaccine access, as it reviews immunization data and makes recommendations on who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other duties. But the presentation to that panel is not final, the Post reported. “FDA and CDC staff routinely analyze VAERS and other safety monitoring data, and those reviews are being shared publicly through the established ACIP process,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement, referring to the panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. “Until that is shared publicly, any this should be considered pure speculation,” the spokesperson added.

> Pfizer’s stock fell more than 3% on Friday, while shares of Moderna dropped more than 7%. Novavax, which creates protein-based Covid shots, slid more than 4%. The report comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moves to change vaccine policy in the U.S. He has dropped Covid shot recommendations for healthy kids and pregnant women and set new limits on the approval of new jabs against the virus. In a statement, Moderna said the safety of its vaccine is “rigorously monitored” by the company, the FDA and regulators in more than 90 countries.

You can participate in IPOs but they have an anti-flipping rule that if you sell it within 15 days you get a 180 day ban from participating in IPOs the first time, and if you do it again you get a 1 year ban. Kind of annoying since if they were serious about IPO flipping they would just outright prohibit you from doing it. Also, presumably institutions and higher-level traders don't have those types of restrictions, so it's really a penalty to disadvantage retail traders.

Curious, does anybody know of retail trader platforms that don't have any IPO flipping penalties?

1nfa1qo,2025-09-12,2025-09-12 13:55:45,Follow-up: Why flu vaccine economics shouldn’t apply to Cidara’s (CDTX) CD388 universal flu prophylaxis,"In response to my earlier post asking if Cidara’s (CDTX) CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” was the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market ([CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), I received a number of comments that begged the question:  Why should CD388 be priced any differently than flu vaccines?

This question is worthy of a deeper dive to explain why I think why vaccine economics should not apply to CD388:

1. CD388 isn’t a vaccine! It **doesn’t depend on the immune system**, so what this means in practical terms is that **it will work** just as **well for people that have weakened immune systems**, like the elderly, cancer patients, or people with other diseases that suppress immune function, as it will for healthy people.
2. CD388 is **flu strain agnostic**, whereas vaccines need to be reformulated yearly in the hopes of matching the most active strains.  For folks with weakened immune systems and at high risk of complications from the flu, the seasonal uncertainty of protection from vaccines translates to risk, and this risk translates to lifestyle changes (like wearing a mask and staying home) that have a serious impact on quality of life.
3. **CD388 works pretty much right away**, whereas it generally takes a couple of weeks for healthy immune systems to build up immunity after exposure to a vaccine.  This means people most at risk will be able to be confident that they’re protected soon after receiving CD388 and will stay protected through the flu season.
4. The effect of **CD388 is additive to vaccines**!  In terms of protecting the most at-risk population, this means that vaccines and CD388 can be used together to maximize protection against disease.

The key point here is that if the effectiveness of CD388 demonstrated in Cidara's 5000+ person-strong phase 2b holds for their phase 3 trial, they will have a drug that, for the population for which the flu disease burden is highest (i.e., where there is higher risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death), is far more effective than available flu vaccines.   Not only more effective, but additive to current vaccines.  Vaccines alone don’t deliver this same benefit to this population and so don't have the same value – economic or otherwise.  That’s why the company believes that a mAb prophylaxis like Beyfortus, not a flu vaccine, is a better reference for CD388 pricing.

Although I only included this high risk population in my original TAM calculation, the fact that CD388 is pan-influenza and applicable to H5 (Bird flu) strains, and that it works near-instantly, makes it an obvious candidate as a medical countermeasure for pandemic preparedness.   There is no doubt that stockpiling at scale for the masses would drive a different pricing regime, consistent with the volumes that can be expected for such stockpiles.  I excluded this “icing on the cake” from my previous analysis, however, simply because the numbers just leave me shaking my head in disbelief! I’ll leave that analysis for when and if BARDA gives us a hint of what that stockpiling might be worth.

Bottom line, I am still looking for the definitive answer to my original question: Is Cidara's CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market?  Some of the feedback I’ve received suggest that its current discount reflects its development stage, but my valuation math already considers a measured probability of success (or failure).   Does a 60%-80% discount on top of my already risk-managed rNPV really make sense?

For discussion only. This is a question, and not investment advice! I hold shares of $CDTX.",11,11,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfa1qo/followup_why_flu_vaccine_economics_shouldnt_apply/,new,Company Discussion,0.82

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

But with Nasdaq now asking the SEC to allow trading tokenized stocks, the roles might be reversing: traditional finance is moving into blockchain territory.

What stands out is that tokenization isn’t new.

Crypto platforms have already been experimenting with RWA products for a while  from tokenized bonds to futures tied to stocks like TSLA or NVDA.

These products weren’t perfect, but they proved the concept and attracted real user demand.


Now, Nasdaq itself wants in, asking regulators to approve rule changes so tokenized stocks can trade alongside traditional ones, under the same conditions. That’s a massive shift in narrative: Wall Street isn’t just watching RWA anymore, it wants to own it.

So here’s the open question:

If Wall Street starts pushing tokenized equities and bonds, will crypto platforms that pioneered these products (like Bitget with its RWA index futures) still have an edge?

Or will the traditional markets simply absorb the idea and leave Web3 players behind?

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don’t make money, they burn money, so it’s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it’s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it’s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm’s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it’s going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies.

WASHINGTON (AP) - In another grim sign for the U.S. labor market, jobless claim applications jumped to their highest level in almost four years last week, virtually assuring the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate next week.

The index for all items less food and energy increased 0.3 percent in August (SA); up 3.1 percent over the year (NSA).""

The expected inflation, combined with an increasingly weak job market, sets the stage for the expected next week's Fed interest rate cut. There was a 92% chance of a 25 bp cut and 8% chance of a 50 bp cut prior to this morning's CPI report.

Wall Street is looking forward to a more aggressive trajectory of rate cuts alongside the slowing jobs market.  A growing number of economists now forecast a quarter-point rate cut at each of this year’s three remaining meetings, instead of just two cuts. 

""The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.4 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in August, after rising 0.2 percent in July, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today.

The index for shelter rose 0.4 percent in August and was the largest factor in the all items monthly increase. The food index increased 0.5 percent over the month as the food at home index rose 0.6 percent and the food away from home index increased 0.3 percent. The index for energy rose 0.7 percent in August as the index for gasoline increased 1.9 percent over the month.

I'll prove it.","**TL;DR: I believe $BYRN will pop off on or before their earnings call on October 8th.** Shorts are trying to convince you that a company with 57% revenue growth and frankly explosive profits is a bad bet. They are wrong.


    Standard play: $BYRN shares currently $19-20;
    
    Budget play 1: 10/17 25c currently ~$0.65;
    
    Budget play 2: 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80. 


\---------------------------------------------------

In 2023, I started value investing again. Responsibly. Just a bit. And long story short, I found BYRN. I've been holding it since it was $4. After their 2025 first quarter earnings, they spiked to around $34, where I took profits. But then the stock sank. And sank some more. For no reason. So I bought back. And so should you.

Disclaimer: I couldn't post this in WSB because BYRN is at $475mm market cap and doesn't meet the $500mm minimum requirement. Hopefully tomorrow I can post there too.

---
- *Quick rundown of Byrna.  It's a nonlethal gun (""launcher"") company that gained attention after Google banned them from advertising on their platforms in 2023 for promoting violence. Ironic. Police departments worldwide are using it now, and the Streisand effect is gaining them more and more contracts. Their CMRO is genuinely goated, most recently securing a deal with Sportsman's Warehouse to have in-store Byrna demo rooms. It's been a massive success, as you'll see below. They have*  ***zero debt and positive income***.

---

Seriously though, there's like literally no reason it's being suppressed at $20. I have reason to believe there's some bullshittery happening here. Here I shall present to you my thesis on their October 8th earnings call. Fun fact, I typed this entire thing myself. No AI.

So you're doubtful? Nah bruh. LOOK at the

###Fundamentals:

**Tariff resistance stats:** 100% ammo production in the USA. 92% launcher production in the USA.

**Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $26.2 million (57% increase from $16.7 million)
    Gross Profit: $15.9 million (61% of revenue)
    Net Income: $1.7 million (9900% increase from $17,000)

**Q2 2025 vs. Q2 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $28.5 million (41% increase from $20.3 million)
    Gross Profit: $17.6 million (62% of revenue)
    Net Income: $2.4 million (14% increase from $2.1 million)


**Q3 2025 vs. Q3 2024 (Preliminary)**:

    Net Revenue: $28.2 million (35% increase from $20.9 million)
     - Driven by a 147% increase in chain store and dealer channels (wtf)
    Web sales increased by 8%.
    International sales grew by 33%.

Like please. In one of the most turbulent economic chapters in US history, BYRN is STILL ramping its sales and margins. And yet, the stock is hovering around $20. My best guess is, your average retail investor isn't who is shorting it. It's someone else. Possibly a hedge fund, because 66% of BYRN is owned by institutional investors who don't give enough of a shit to short it.

I've been tracking this stock for 2 years now. People are catching on. Remember, these guys were trading at $4 in 2023. Every single one of their C level execs is amazing. Analyst price targets are between $35 and $46. The company is officially profitable, and income is consistently in the black. But the stock is marooned at $20. I couldn't make sense of it, because I don't like conspiracy theories. But it kept happening. For MONTHS.

###The Short ""Interest""

Yeah, we're a bit allergic to the term ""shorts"" these days. I get it. But... I have to call it out. Because as of August 15th, the short interest on BYRN was 4.08 million shares, or 23.1% of the total float. ***Nearly a quarter of the company’s publicly traded shares are being shorted.***

##***23.1% short interest on a profitable, zero debt company.*** WHAT.

> **They use AI in their marketing...**

- The target market for the AI ads are boomers who shop at Sportsman’s Warehouse. They can’t tell the difference between AI and a real video, and they don’t care. I literally sent my parents the video and asked them what was wrong with it. My mom said ""it was a wonderful ad, very clever"". Bullish.

> **The economy is uncertain...**

- BYRN is nearly immune to tariffs. See Tariff Resist Stats above. The fact that the stock moves on tariff news is honestly dumb as heck, but we live in the world of algos now. Bullish, but also I'm a bit pissed about this.

> **They're burning cash...**

- Yep. New product release (Byrna CL), they're burning cash to stockpile and advertise it. And they're still in the black. AND it’s working. Gotta spend money to make money. Bullish.


The preliminary earnings for Q3 are already out, and they are fantastic. The only thing left to be revealed in October is the EPS, and I’m betting 30k shares that it’s going to be another profitable quarter.

Why am I writing this all out? Because I want someone else other than me to be interested in this. BYRN is an obviously overlooked company. I rode the wave from $4 without saying a word and waiting for talking heads from Yahoo.com to spread the news. But lately I've been thinking, there's a big value play here, and it's happening because somebody with a lot of money somewhere made a mistake and needs time to unload. I'm expecting it to run up to somewhere from $35-$45. Am I crazy? Can someone stop me because I want to throw 100% of my portfolio into this baddie. I'm actually simping for this company so hard its crazy.

###Plays to take advantage of this (I did all 3):

1. 10/17 25c currently ~$0.60-$0.90

2. Buy the stock. Currently hovering between $19-$21

3. 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80 (less risky play)

**$SOUN** provides voice enabled platforms for cars, restaurants, and customer support. They sell voice solutions to businesses. It’s still early stage and not fully profitable, but the growth potential is there.

**$OPEN** is a tech driven home buying and selling company. They give homeowners instant cash offers, flip houses, and offer extra services like title and escrow. Their revenue swings a lot with housing market cycles and management moves.

**$RR** makes service robots for hospitality, restaurants, warehouses, and cleaning. Some robots handle drinks, deliveries, or cleaning, basically taking over repetitive human tasks. Deployment is growing, but profitability is still in the early stages.

All three companies are using technology or systems to replace or streamline traditional processes. None of them are rock solid profitable yet, so stock swings can be wild. News, market sentiment, or sector trends can make big moves in either direction. Their solutions have large potential markets. Voice platforms can be scaled across industries, Opendoor targets the massive US housing market, and RR’s robots can be applied wherever service humans are needed.

Of course, there are risks, costs are high (development, deployment, maintenance), market adoption isn’t guaranteed, competition is fierce, and management/operational risks exist (e.g., OPEN had CEO changes recently).

So, yeah, they're not the same companies, but they are all future, AI + automation or robotics. Could be fun to watch if you'd like speculative trades,  but don't be fooled, they are not low risk.

I’ve been digging into Cidara ($CDTX), which is developing CD388, a once-per-season prophylaxis for influenza. Essentially a “universal flu med” for high-risk groups (elderly, immunocompromised, diabetics) where vaccines don't work well. It recently came out of a large phase 2b trial with ""game-changer"" efficacy results and will soon be moving on to phase 3.

Share price today: ~$63/share × ~42M FD shares (fully diluted) = ~$2.7B valuation.

Note: It perked up a bit today (and promptly settled back down), I suspect because the company mentioned yesterday to investors at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference that they were very happy with how their end of phase 2b meeting with the FDA in August went. Also, their phase 3, which was supposed to start in the spring 2026, is now posted on clinicaltrials.gov as starting this fall. No official PR from Cidara yet, but it seems some good news is coming.

Anyway, here's my math on valuation (conservative inputs):

TAM for CD388: ~285M high-risk in WHO high-income countries (CDC/WHO data, overlap-adjusted). I am extrapolating from the company's US-only data because it seems silly to think a universal flu drug that works well and is safe will only sell in the US.

Pricing: Anchored to long-acting prophylactics (like Beyfortus RSV mAb), not cheap antivirals. U.S. ~$495/dose, ex-U.S. ~$225 → ~$280 weighted avg. (company has done market research and projects confidence that payers will cover at these price points. The ex. US assumption is my own, but follows typical patters of 50% reduction outside US).

COGS: ~$70/dose (figure mentioned by CFO in recent presentation, better as they scale production) → ~75% gross margin. Net margin assumed at 25% (in line with biologics).

Uptake: 25% peak (~71M treated). For context: flu vaccine coverage = ~45% of U.S. adults, ~70% of seniors. So 25% feels skeptical, not aggressive. I more realistic number would be to match vaccine uptake in this high-risk population, but I'm trying to keep this conservative.

Valuation (rNPV): Launch 2028 (potential timing for approval also mentioned by CEO in above conference), patent to 2039, biosimilar erosion by 2042. Discount 10%, PoS 75%. Outcome = ~$22B NPV → $445–530/share!

That's a big number for a clinical stage biotech, but this is a universal flu play! And Cidara is also a platform play with an oncology med based on the same DFC platform waiting in the wings, so maybe it should at least get some optionality out of that.

So my question: why the disconnect?

Is it just “clinical-stage biotech = high risk” until Phase 3 reads out?

Are institutions deliberately keeping this quiet until they’re positioned? (huge institutional interest vs. small free retail float)

Is the market over-discounting dilution, competition, or BARDA uncertainty?

From where I sit, the numbers look like 7–8× upside, but the stock sits flat at $62-$64.

Curious to hear from this community: what am I missing? Why does the market price CD388 so conservatively when even cautious rNPV with risk levers turned up points so much higher?

1ndkcue,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 13:18:00,WeRide – Quietly Crushing the Autonomous Driving Game,"Alright, let’s talk about a ticker nobody’s giving enough love: WeRide ($WRD).

Yeah, their earnings were 2 months ago, but sometimes you gotta let the hype die down and actually look at the numbers. And holy hell, these guys are quietly building one of the strongest plays in autonomous driving.

Q2 ‘25 Recap:

* Total revenue hit $17.8M, up 60% YoY.
* Robotaxi revenue exploded +836% YoY to $6.4M. That’s now over a third of their total business – it’s not a “pilot program” anymore, it’s a legit revenue driver.
* Gross profit climbed 40% YoY, with gross margin sitting pretty at 28%. Scaling AND getting more efficient. Most of their competitors can’t say that.
* They dropped HPC 3.0, running on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor. This isn’t just marketing fluff – it cuts system cost in half while keeping it fully automotive-grade. Lower costs + better scalability = every fleet rollout becomes more profitable.
* Market Cap still only 2.7 Billion - potential 10x in coming years

Global footprint (bigger than most people realize):

* Abu Dhabi: robotaxi fleet tripled since Dec ‘24. Over 2,200 days of safe ops – regulators love that.
* Saudi Arabia: first company to run robotaxis in Riyadh. Major flex in the Middle East.
* Singapur: First operating autonomous vehicle without a safety driver in South-East Asia
* Permits in 6 countries.
* Uber and Grab partnership: the real kicker. WeRide’s tech is getting plugged into Uber’s and Grab's ecosystems, with plans for 15 cities outside US/China in the next 5 years. Uber also tossed in a $100M investment.

People sleep on this – WeRide isn’t just pushing one product. They’ve got:

* Robotaxis (obviously)
* Robobusses
* Robovans (autonomous logistics/delivery)
* Robosweepers (city sanitation, already deployed)
* Other mobility/transport solutions, all running on the WeRide One Platform.

That means multiple revenue streams across mobility + logistics + smart city services. They’re building an ecosystem.

Look, the stock isn’t mooning *yet*. They’re still in growth mode, and yes, net income is red. But think about it: massive YoY growth, global ops scaling, partnerships with Uber, Grab, Lenovo and NVIDIA, and a diversified portfolio. Compare that to the other AV players stuck in testing loops or bleeding cash without a clear roadmap.

This is how a long game looks – grab market share, get permits, build trust with regulators, diversify products, line up big-name partners, and then ride the revenue curve.

TL;DR  
2 months after earnings and I’m still hyped:

* Revenue up 60%, robotaxi rev up 836%.
* NVIDIA-powered HPC 3.0 = cheaper, faster scaling.
* Global expansion (Abu Dhabi, Saudi, Singapur, 6 permits worldwide).
* Uber deal with $100M backing.
* Broad product lineup beyond taxis.

I’m not saying it’s going 10x overnight, but this smells like a sleeper growth stock that’ll sneak up on everyone. While the herd chases Tesla and Waymo FSD headlines, WeRide is quietly racking up cities, fleets, and partnerships.",26,15,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndkcue/weride_quietly_crushing_the_autonomous_driving/,new,Company Analysis,0.76

The cloud giant is on pace for its best day since 1999, and is now quickly approaching the $1 trillion market cap benchmark

The company said it has $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 359% from a year earlier.

“This is a very historic kind of print right here from Oracle with this backlog,” Ben Reitzes, technology research head at Melius Research, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Tuesday. “The Street was looking for about $180 billion in RPO and they’re talking about a number that is a multiple of that. That is astounding.”

Oracle now sees $18 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in the 2026 fiscal year, with the company calling for the annual sum to reach $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion and $144 billion over the subsequent four years.

Other analysts were left “blown away” and “in shock.” D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria called it “absolutely staggering on CNBC’s “Fast Money.” Wells Fargo analysts said it was a “momentous confirmation” of the artificial intelligence trade.

1ndeclp,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 09:33:52,Broadcom Cements Its AI Credentials,"**Broadcom (AVGO) $342**

I first bought Broadcom more than a year ago for $150, and added more yesterday around $340, deciding to take the plunge after holding on and realizing that the price wouldn’t come down.

Broadcom (AVGO) the second largest AI chipmaker, and the leader by far in custom GPUs, and datacenter networking gear declared July quarter results that just passed estimates by a whisker.

The stock, however, rallied massively the next day as the ebullient CEO, Hock Tan talked up a massive $110Bn backlog , a new $10Bn customer and an expanding TAM for custom silicon and datacenter networking.

**The quarterly results and guidance at a glance**

* Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.69 beat by $0.03.
* Revenue of $15.95Bn (+22.0% YoY) beat by $130Mn. Broadcom’s revenue growth rest on two pillars, AI 32% and VMware 36% of sales, so an overall 22% growth is  excellent for the company.
* Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7Bn, with a 67% margin.
* A massive cash haul of 7.2Bn less Capex of just $142Mn, gave it an FCF of $7 Bn or 44% of revenue – **Very impressive.**

**Guidance was also close to estimates on supply constraints.**

The good stuff came during the earnings call, which was much more illuminating; CEO Hock Tan was very enthused about AI prospects, and talked about sufficiently faster growth and a massive backlog of $110Bn, plus he confirmed adding a new customer, rumored to be OpenAI.

This is one company and CEO, I respect tremendously. Hock Tan whose tenure was extended to 2030 by the board always talks up a big game; more importantly he delivers like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Arista Networks', Jayshree Ullal. 

**From Broadcom’s Q3 Earnings call:**

>

**Broadcom’s strengths and positive catalysts**

**AI revenue share keeps rising:** The share of AI revenue has gone up to an estimated 32-33% of FY2025 sales from 24% last year and based on management’s confidence in Ethernet and custom silicon scale ups and scale outs it should grow to $34Bn in FY2026, or 43% of sales and $56Bn in FY2027 or 61% of total sales. Broadcom’s sales and earnings multiples expand with each percentage increase of AI in the total mix.

**Ethernet can increase market share:** Management believes that hyperscalers prefer Ethernet “as one single fabric for both scale-out and scale-up,” and Broadcom’s Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers, and NICs can continue to grow and gain datacenter connectivity share over competitors like Nvidia, Arista Networks and Marvell.

**High margin SaaS continues to grow:** VMware continues to be a pillar of strength, with 17% high margin revenue growth. Besides, Broadcom is positioning VMware as an integrated AI solution with custom silicon.

**Strong margins:** Broadcom has strong 37% adjusted operating and 44% operating cash flow margins.

**Increasing TAM:** Previously, management had indicated that FY2026 AI revenue growth might be similar to FY2025 (roughly +50–60% YoY). But now, with the addition of a fourth hyperscaler, Broadcom’s 2026’s AI growth to “accelerate” beyond that rate, likely between 60 and 70%. The new $10Bn+ XPU customer has moved to production for AI server racks with shipments scheduled to begin in Q3 FY2026. This deal suggests several million custom AI chips could be delivered, aimed at AI inference workloads, which is the next big frontier as it takes over from training, and cements Broadcom as one of the biggest and preferred inference players.  Inference requires significantly more tokenization than training, which means hyperscalers will have to continue investing, to continue getting higher throughput at lower costs, which is key to Broadcom’s success. The $110Bn backlog that Tan spoke of confirms that this demand is much higher than anticipated.

**Broadcom’s biggest challenge is valuation, 20x FY2026 sales growing at 22%, leaves it with little room for error. It is priced to perfection.**",29,8,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndeclp/broadcom_cements_its_ai_credentials/,new,Company Discussion,0.85

Only negative part IMO is that the growth projections are in the single digits, so it's not a high growth company.

On the other hand, it's current pull backs from its 2024 highs is quite significant. It sits where it was around 5 years ago where it is sitting on a rather strong support.

1nd8ojp,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 04:33:18,Investing in (the rise of retail) investing?,"Hello again!

Three months ago I made a reddit thread about Investing in Escapism. I took my observations as a gen Z living in SEA and I had good discussions in the previous thread with people sharing their experience and what industries/stocks might benefit from escapism.

My initial bets were: Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (700), and Meta. They're all doing well and I even added RDDT into my portfolio due to that thread, it's up over 100% now (sadly I haven't bought much of it yet).

I was still exploring into industries like BNPL which are really popular in poorer SEA countries (in Thailand where I live, the government warns that people are using BNPL to pay for food and groceries), and traveling (one redditor raised traveling as another thing to look out for, and from my observation it seems most Gen Z's seem to travel a lot, I see people taking a trip to Japan. I even plan one myself later this year). I ruled out Gaming and Alcoholism. (There was RBLX mentioned too, and it's been doing well this year)  
  
While I was thinking about Escapism, It hit me that I, too, am one of the target demographic. There is a raising trend about Gen Z who take their finances much more seriously than previous generations. Crypto, trading, stocks are becoming common words. I started investing back when I was 22-23, now I'm 28 and it's changed my life trajectory massively. There are probably many who are also doing this. a gen Z investor/customer will mean a lifetime of commission/fees if a service can make them stick long term.

I'm not familiar with all the financial service or other non-stock space. My initial thought is obviously my broker: IBKR. I've been using their service since 2021 and I'm very happy with them. They have lower fees and global reach for both markets and clients. The financial knowledge in the US is likely the highest of the world, all the cheapest index funds and competitive brokerages are over there. I think the rest of the world will slowly catch up, which could mean positive outlook for IBKR who's positioned to benefit the most from the rise of retail investing (outside of maybe S&P 500 itself due to all the money flowing over there). Coinbase is another that comes to my mind but I haven't looked into it.

I want to hear your thoughts. Which stocks or industries do you think will directly or indirectly benefit the most from the rise of retail investing?

NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices settled higher on Tuesday after the Israeli military said it carried out an attack on Hamas leadership in the Qatari capital Doha, an expansion of its military actions in the Middle East.

Brent crude futures settled 37 cents, or 0.6%, higher at $66.39 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures also climbed 37 cents, or 0.6%, to close at $62.63 a barrel.

Both benchmarks had gained almost 2% shortly after the Israeli attack on Qatar, but gave up the majority of those gains later as the United States assured Doha that such a thing would not happen again on its soil.

""Both the U.S. and Qatar have made it clear they are not seeking further escalation, while the muted reaction from other (Gulf Cooperation Council) members reinforces the view that the risk of a wider regional flare-up remains contained,"" said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.""

For now, geopolitical risk premiums are easing rather than building,"" Leon said.

Oil prices also pared some gains because the attack did not create any immediate supply disruption, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.

The oil benchmarks were trading higher prior to the attack on Qatar, supported by the latest oil output increase from OPEC+ being smaller than anticipated, expectations that China will continue stockpiling oil and concerns over potential new sanctions against Russia.",29,1,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nd7rzv/oil_settles_higher_after_israeli_attack_on_qatar/,new,Industry News,0.87

1nd1djr,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 21:37:26,Nebius Moves To The Big Leagues,"**The $17.4Bn to $19.4Bn Nebius - Microsoft Deal**

NBIS ($96)

**This is a tremendous deal for Nebius.**

My investment thesis for Nebius was based on its technical/engineering strengths as a medium sized Neocloud provider democratizing AI infrastructure for medium sized businesses who did not want or need to pay exorbitant fees to AWS or the other hyperscalers. Prior to this deal, its biggest customer was Shopify and it was well on its way to expanding its reach to companies at, or below Shopify’s size.

**Nebius' competitive advantages:** Its biggest strengths lie in its full software stack, honed by decades of engineering talent from the ex Yandex team, instead of being a brute provider of GPU‘s in scale like Coreweave, which meant that it had the competitive advantage of not being sucked into lower pricing from just renting out GPUs. It could command a higher price and margin than other Neocloud providers, by focusing more on providing a platform and a superior stack of solutions, plus its customers were supposed to be smaller, giving it more bargaining power. Its second competitive advantage is its strategic relationship with Nvidia, which allows it to commit and guarantee computing power, the way it did with Microsoft. It has the GPUs and the datacenter infrastructure to ensure that there are no supply constraints or bottlenecks.

**Excellent Return On Investment**: Prior to this deal, its estimated sales growth was $0.6Bn in 2025, growing to $9Bn by 2030, and my target was 8X sales or a market cap of $72Bn, which was about 5x the market cap of $15Bn it was selling at till yesterday - so an almost 5x return over 5 years or 37% per year. **Pretty hefty.**

**Even better ROI:** A deal of $18Bn at mid-point clearly changes these estimates and I’m conservatively forecasting the six year deal adds at least $2Bn to revenue each year. And of course, they will get growth from other clients, a massive deal like this gives them even more cachet - my revised sales target for 2030 is $13.5Bn, valuing Nebius at 10x sales = $135Bn. CEO, Arkady Volozh calls this just the beginning, and so far he has walked the talk. At $135Bn we could be looking at almost 7x the current market cap of $22.6Bn (at a price of$95), or a return of 42% per year.

**Need to raise capital:** They will need to raise at least $3-5Bn in the next 2-3 years from both debt and equity, to play in the majors, but what’s also amazing is that they are financing this with Microsoft’s cash and credit, which means the dilution/interest payments will not be that high. Nebius still comes out way ahead with another 30% increase in share count, if needed at this price. Coreweave has $7.5 billion in long-term debt with about $7 billion in sales in 2025 with around $30 billion worth of contracts, and their growth trajectory confirms that capital raises are absolutely necessary for Neoclouds to thrive. 

**Adding more shares:** I was very content to hold and even sold off some in the mid-sixties after getting 2.6x my purchase price of $23, but now I think the stock is still worth buying even though it has shot up 45% in a day, considering where this company could go in the next five years. This deal actually validates my original thesis and I have no qualms about pyramiding (adding smaller quantities) to my holding.  
**To be sure, this increases the risks and challenges, namely execution, reduction in AI demand, enhanced competition, and dilution, but I think the risks are worth it.**",59,27,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nd1djr/nebius_moves_to_the_big_leagues/,new,Company Discussion,0.86

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.47 adjusted vs. $1.48 expected
* **Revenue:** $14.93 billion vs. $15.04 billion expected

Revenue increased 12% from a year earlier during the quarter, which ended on Aug. 31, according to a statement. Net income was about flat at $2.93 billion, or $1.01 per share, compared to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Oracle said its remaining performance obligation, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been contracted, now stands at $455 billion, up some 359% from a year earlier. During the quarter OpenAI said it signed an agreement with Oracle to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity.

Alongside larger cloud providers such as Microsoft, Oracle has been one of the big winners of the AI boom, due to its cloud infrastructure business and its access to Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) needed for large workloads. CEO Safra Catz said in the statement that the company signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the quarter.

Also in the quarter, Oracle said cloud rival Google’s Gemini artificial intelligence models would become available on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure.

Oracle shares hit a record last month and are up 45% in 2025 as of Tuesday’s close, while the S&P 500 index has gained 11%.

They got in a pissing match with an FDA official, and long story short, it’s still ongoing but in a detente. They have huge political support, as well as support from families of the kids suffering from this. The FDA pulled their therapy, yet shortly after, put it back on the market. 

There is no other solution for kids suffering from DMD, and nothing in the near or medium term either. If they can continue to keep their drug on the market and if they’re allowed to sell it to non-ambulatory patients again (perhaps in conjunction with some liver-protecting drugs) the stock could potentially go back to triple digits.

1ncj0ng,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 09:31:48,"Why are all EVTOLs posts focusing on Joby/Archer, while EH seems at least as promising, if not better ?","Every week there are new threads on this sub trying to pump Archer, and occasionally Joby, but I feel like the discourse here completely overlooks EHang, which is to me a much safer bet for the following reasons 


**1. First to Market, first to revenue**

While Joby and Archer are still in the FAA certification process, EHang has already achieved its equivalent in China. They hold the Type Certificate, Production Certificate, and a standard Airworthiness Certificate from the CAAC for their EH216-S model. It has allowed them to be the first in the world to launch commercial, passenger-carrying eVTOL operations. EHang has a full year of revenue-generating flights under its belt and what appears to be a growing order book. Joby and Archer, for all their progress, are still effectively pre-revenue companies on the passenger side. To me, this is a considerable edge over them, as they actually have something on the market now. 

**2. A much more favourable environment**

EHang operates in a region that is actively championing the growth of the ""low-altitude economy."" The Chinese government and various local municipalities are partnering with EHang, providing financial support and, most importantly, a clear and streamlined regulatory pathway. This contrasts sharply with the challenges in the United States and Europe, where there are way more regulatory roadblock, NIMBY sentiments, and a general mindset that is more cautious towards new technologies. 

In my opinion, this is crucial, as if you really think about it, the current certifications hurdles are just the start for Western companies, as building the infrastructure for EVTOLs will definitely be met with a lot of resistance, flight routes will be considered a disturbance for the locals and will struggle to receive approvals, and the development might be extremely slowed down because of it, independently of the actual viability of the vehicles.

**3. A more pragmatic approach**

Personally, I think EHang’s strategy of starting with a simpler, two-seater, autonomous vehicle has paid off quite well. It allowed them to achieve certification and commercialization far earlier. A key point for me is that their platform was designed to be autonomous from day one, which I believe is the ultimate endgame for this industry in terms of operational efficiency and scalability. It also gives credibility to their ambitions when it comes to longer range vehicles. 

Their VT-35 will be able to fly 300km, and is already well into its certification process with the CAAC. They have a partnership with the city of Hefei to establish a comprehensive product hub for the VT-35, involving a joint investment of approximately 1 billion RMB, covering R&D, testing, manufacturing, and the entire certification process, significantly accelerating the model's industrialization.

They're also making variants of their EH216 model for other applications such as logistics and firefighting. 

**4. Tangible growth and expansion**

It's also clear that EHang's ambitions are not confined to its domestic market. Over the past year, they've solidified partnerships in the UAE, Southeast Asia, and parts of Europe, moving from demonstration flights to laying the groundwork for international sales and operations. This suggests a clear and aggressive growth strategy.

**5. The massive valuation disconnect**

EHang's market cap is hovering around $1 billion. Compare that to Archer at ~$5.5 billion and Joby at ~$11.5 billion.

To me, there is a massive valuation gap. It looks to me like the market is pricing Joby and Archer for near-perfect future execution, while seemingly discounting EHang's very real, present-day achievements. It makes the risk/reward much more attractive ofr EH.

**Conclusion: A safer bet on a very speculative sector**

As I see it, investing in Joby and Archer rely on a lot of uncertain event to go rights, starting from the certification, to the viability of the mass production, whether the piloted model can be viable or not (it's not an uber, you won't get away with paying pilots peanuts, so this makes the commercial viability more challenging as costs will be higher), the need to manage the roadblocks to the required infrastructure development, NIMBY blocking flight routes, safety concerns of the customers, etc. EVTOLs might succeed, but it's definitely a tough road ahead.

With EHang, I feel like you're investing in a company that has already proven its model. They have a certified product, established manufacturing, growing revenue, and a supportive domestic market. When factoring in that you're getting all this for a fraction of its competitors market caps, I find it hard to justify picking them over EH at the moment.

To be honest, I'm sure a lot of people will react with the usual ""China is uninvestable"" discourse, but I feel like it makes very little sense in this case, as the usual risks associated with Chinese stocks are very minor compared to the huge risk that such speculative investments represent in the first place. Even if you want to discount the stock a bit for it, it should at least be in the conversation when discussing EVTOLs companies.

1ncf2fd,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 06:19:34,"Share that one stock that everybody seems to hate, but you like","To me, it is $SNAP

Everybody is saying the same things about it. The CEO sucks, they have flopped many products, they can't monetize in the way that other social media giants can. But the reason I believe it's a good purchase: It’s survived wave after wave of “this app is dead” & still the userbase is growing year after year.

Snapchat is growing year-over-year, with a 7% increase in global monthly active users (MAU) to 932 million and a 9% increase in daily active users (DAU) to 469 million in Q2 2025.

This makes it very interesting for acquisitions by e.g. Meta or Google - or simply a complete overhaul of the monetization done by money hungry consultancy firms such as Mckinsey or Deloitte.

Besides, they currently already have increased profit quarter after quarter. They could even keep improving with the current set-up.

And the cherry on top: it's currently trading at an all time low.

It has the potential to grow slowly in the current states, but it could also increase exponentially with exciting developments in the future.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1ncdql0,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 04:54:59,Thoughts on SpaceX's acquisition of Echostar,"In the realm of satellite communications, the most critical and scarce resource is frequency; orbital resources, by contrast, are abundant.

Among the foreign D2C satellite constellations, the only one that can truly compete with Starlink is ASTS, which is backed by numerous telecommunications operators. The others are merely dabbling.

ASTS has three relative advantages.

First, it has a large number of partner operators. Once its satellite network is complete, its services can be rolled out faster and more broadly.

Second, it has more frequency resources. Currently, most mobile communication frequencies are held by operators. With more partners, ASTS clearly has an advantage in this area. On a lighter note, ASTS once tested on a frequency band partially allocated to amateur radio enthusiasts, which drew protests from the amateur community. ASTS claimed their tests proved there would be no negative impact on others, but the FCC didn't buy their story and swiftly issued a clear order prohibiting ASTS from using that band.

Third, its satellites are more advanced, boasting the world's largest satellite communications array (223 square meters).

However, Starlink has now aggressively secured the AWS-4 and PCS H-Block frequency bands with its financial power, significantly diminishing ASTS's frequency advantage.

On the other hand, ASTS is facing delays in its network deployment. Only five BlueBird-1 satellites (the first generation, with a 64-square-meter array) are currently in operation. The manufacturing and launch progress of BlueBird-2 is far behind schedule. In contrast, Starlink has already deployed over 600 of its first-generation D2C satellites and has launched D2C data services via an app on select phones. Its next-generation D2C satellites are rumored to have thousands of directional beams, increasing communication capacity by 20-fold. ASTS's technological lead is shrinking, and the manufacturing and launch costs of BlueBird-2 are far higher than Starlink's. Even with a technical edge, it cannot compete with Starlink on a cost-performance basis.

Starlink's dominance in the D2C constellation market is becoming more solidified, and there is a possibility that operators who once backed ASTS could switch sides.

However, Starlink's D2C service still faces potential challenges.

Most existing mobile phones do not support the AWS-4 and PCS H-Block bands. To use these frequencies in the future, cooperation from handset manufacturers is required. Among these, Apple's stance is the most critical, and Apple has always had a poor relationship with SpaceX. Apple has been planning for D2C service for a long time, with its main satellite partner being Globalstar. It launched ""Emergency SOS via Satellite"" in 2022. However, Globalstar is still a traditional, old-school aerospace company, where delays and high costs are commonplace, and its network deployment is slow (a classic case of ""starting early but finishing late,"" which has become a traditional skill for Apple). When Starlink and T-Mobile launched their D2C service, Apple's response was not very enthusiastic. Although the iPhone series eventually enabled the service, its rollout was slower than that of Samsung and other phone manufacturers.

The future will depend on whether SpaceX and Apple can reconcile. If Apple remains stubborn and opposes SpaceX at the risk of losing money and alienating operators (a small but existing possibility), there isn't much SpaceX can do. As for the idea that SpaceX or Tesla would manufacture their own phones, it's best to take that with a grain of salt.

There is also speculation that SpaceX might enter the market directly and become a mobile communications operator itself. This scenario is also unlikely. SpaceX still holds too few frequency licenses. Becoming an operator involves a very cumbersome process of approvals and qualifications. Partnering with existing operators remains the best option.

Finally, while the D2C market is a ""blue ocean,"" how large is it really?

Starlink's terminal service has already been a great success because there is a huge market for broadband services in remote areas abroad. Capturing this market segment is enough to be profitable. At the same time, Starlink is also planning to compete in the fiber-to-the-home market. At the same technological level, satellite communication cannot compete with fiber optics in densely populated areas. But the reality is that competition is never based on an equivalent level of technology. The quality of home fiber service providers in Europe and America varies greatly, whereas Starlink is the leader among satellite service providers. It's like the saying: ""My average horse is weaker than yours, but my best horse is stronger than your mid-tier horse."" Therefore, SpaceX is actively preparing for Starlink V3 and the next-generation gigabit home terminal to compete with home fiber.

However, the D2C market may not be as large. The standard Starlink terminal service in the US costs about $100 per month. The monthly fee for D2C is only $10. Revenue from Starlink terminal users is expected to exceed $10 billion this year. If D2C service is priced at $10 per month, with operators taking half, reaching a similar revenue scale of $10 billion would require 160 million users. Achieving such a user base is very difficult.

The situation for mobile phones is different from that of fiber optics. No matter how poor the cell towers are, in densely populated areas, D2C can never compete with terrestrial base stations. Starlink terminals can compete with fiber by using large phased-array antennas and high-frequency, wide-bandwidth satellite communication bands. If the speed isn't enough, they can increase the terminal's array size and add more frequency bands. Mobile phones are limited by their size; the antenna's size and power cannot be increased significantly, and acquiring new frequency bands is an arduous battle for every 10 MHz due to operator monopolies.

D2C is a supplementary solution, meant to cover areas without cell tower signals. Elon Musk has also emphasized this in his speeches. If you disagree, you can argue with him on X. Some might say that technology will evolve and D2C will one day surpass base stations. But terrestrial base stations and ground networks are not standing still; they are also advancing. Furthermore, building a D2C satellite network is not cheap. Because phone antennas are small and their performance is limited, the satellites themselves must have higher performance (which is why ASTS is developing a 223-square-meter array), naturally leading to higher costs.

Therefore, D2C is a future development trend, and major operators, phone manufacturers, and satellite companies are all positioning themselves in this space. D2C constellations are emerging one after another, and a winner at the hundred-billion-dollar level might appear. However, the market size is ultimately limited.

1nbwetv,2025-09-08,2025-09-08 14:54:56,Respectfully: Why on earth should I invest *long term* (10+ yrs) into a MAG7?,"So - don't get me wrong: I believe you likely will not lose any money in the long run. You'll even make quite a lot. But what I am asking myself:


I read a lot about people who spend all their money on Google or Nvidia for the money to have doubled in 10 years. Sounds good - but 10 years is REALLY long and it has a risk of failure that the company gets into trouble and the stock goes sideways instead of up.
Why should I invest into e.g. Nvidia in the *long term* meaning 10+ years? Yes, the stock can grow 10% in a short period of time, and maybe double or triple over the whole time, but why shouldn't I sell earlier and realize my winnings I already have? Then I can invest into something else that might grow a little more in a shorter time frame, and so on. This could create more wealth in a shorter time. And I don't mean WSB-like trading here. More like ""read news every day and look in my depot every week"".


I understand that this might be about safety when investing into single stocks (MAG7 will very unlikely vanish). But IF I want safety, why not use an ETF exclusively? Yes, this has less revenue, but: When I invest in the short term, worst case is that it dips first, goes sideways, and sooner or later goes up (hopefully) - it becomes an unwilling long-term hold. When I invest in the long term, worst case is that just when I need it, the stock did just plummet. I make myself dependent on THIS single company.


Do you understand what I mean? I cannot wrap my head around this really. And what explicitly makes me think is that I am currently +20% with Google and think about cashing out. On the other hand, I think Google could still grow quite a lot within a shorter time frame (2-3 years).",0,88,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbwetv/respectfully_why_on_earth_should_i_invest_long/,new,Advice Request,0.42

> Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that he is “confident” that President Donald Trump’s tariff plan “will win” at the Supreme Court, but warned his agency would be forced to issue massive refunds if the high court rules against it.
> 
> If the tariffs are struck down, he said, “we would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the Treasury,” according to an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
> 
> He added, however, that “if the court says it, we’d have to do it.”
> 
> The Trump administration last week asked the Supreme Court for an “expedited ruling” to overturn an appeals court decision that found most of his tariffs on imports from other countries are illegal.
> 
> Generally, the Supreme Court could take as long as early next summer to issue a decision on the legality of Trump’s tariffs.
> 
> Bessent has said that “delaying a ruling until June 2026 could result in a scenario in which $750 billion-$1 trillion in tariffs have already been collected, and unwinding them could cause significant disruption.”
> 
> The prospect of the government having to refund tariffs of that magnitude could mean an unprecedented windfall to the businesses and entities that paid them.

Not sure how likely this is with SCOTUS but the last time Bessent ""warned"" what would happen if their tariffs were voided they lost in the appeals court decision. 

So this could be another signal that they aren't confident in the legality of about half of these tariffs implemented so far (regardless of him saying he's confident)

I'm curious about what companies will be the biggest winners if they are forced to give tariff refunds. I believe the Section 232 tariffs implemented so far will stay in effect, since the appeals court ruling covers tariffs under IEEPA. So this would mainly impact the retaliatory tariffs levied against every country",1495,215,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbq5q9/treasury_secretary_bessent_warns_of_massive/,new,Broad market news,0.98

Although still early stage, Archer’s push into electric vertical takeoff and landing technology is planting the seeds for a fundamentally new way to navigate urban airspace. The kind of energy around Archer isn't coming from hype, it's rooted in real momentum, industrial innovation backed by big-name partners, solid funding, and a clear path toward commercialization

The fact that someone is calling it a “no-brainer” reflects growing recognition that Archer’s mission to elevate mobility isn't some distant fantasy, it’s steadily becoming reality

Between ambitious certification timelines, manufacturing ramp-ups, and smart investments across the commercial and defense side of aviation, Archer is building a narrative that feels increasingly credible and compelling.

America does not produce any Antimony, and it is *critical* for national defense munitions manufacture. No military bullets can be made without antimony. China has banned its export to the USA, and no, it is not a rare earth metal and so that ban has not been lifted. The antimony will get the mine built, the gold will make the money. The Company in a web presentation has stated that it will sell antimony concentrate created during the gold production to offset that production, making it the lowest cost gold producer in the USA, as well as the largest privately owned gold mine. All finances are in place for getting this started up (500M recently raised), and there is a 2B ExIm loan in the works already.

They only have one real permit left to get (I'm pretty sure, if not it is a dubious second). And that one permit has it's public comment period by the Idaho DEQ ending on Sept 8 (this Monday). After that there is some time to address the comments. I'm not sure of the timing but somewhere soon it goes into a draft permit if there are no significant issues. Given the federal permits take years to address, I'm thinking it's close (EDIT: i.e. all the big questions have been resolved with the federal permits and the state permits are much quicker to resolve). The company in one of their recent updates think it should be any time now. They have already stated that they are ready to present the go forward plan to shareholders anytime the permit(s?) complete which they expected in the summer. Likely production/refining by 2029.

**Look for this from June on YouTube (this sub doesn't allow YouTube links): ""Webinar: Perpetua Resources Unlocking the Stibnite Gold Project"".** It's the best overview out there. Also there are monthly updates on their site. Their projected share price in that was based on gold being $3000/oz is $38/share and $50/share at $3500/oz. If you've noticed, gold is climbing above 3600 and likely to go higher. Some speculate that gold will reach 5K in the next few years. And this is based on the current reserves they are about to open. But in fact there is high likelihood that there is nearly double that on their property, based on past exploratory drilling.

The only pain point is the the Nez Pierce tribe filing constant lawsuits. However I don't think any have stuck so far and they seem to be along the same vein. They're trying another one now but I think the counter argument to sink it is, why did you wait till now, this just seems like some blocking/delaying action. And many of their members want the mine for the jobs. They are trying to cause pain to block it, but simply put the mine is too important to the USA not to go forward.

More importantly is the fact that the mine is of significant strategic interest to the United States. Critical strategic interest in fact. Personally I think it is a done deal. It was on Biden's list to get built, Trump's top ten list, the DoD funded much of the permitting work, etc. That's my $0.02. As one should always do, do your own homework. :) Cheers.",22,3,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbc2vz/perpetua_resources_is_being_added_to_the_sptsx_as/,new,Company News,0.83

The Dutch ASML is committing 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) for Mistral’s 1.7 billion euro (\~$2 billion) fundraise and is expected to get a board seat at Mistral, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private negotiations.

The round will make Mistral the most valuable AI company in Europe with a 10-billion-euro ($11.7 billion) pre-money valuation in its latest Series C funding round, the people said.

ASML declined to comment. Mistral did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

1nazqw0,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 13:47:46,"The Weak Payroll Report Of Only 22,000 jobs Is Bad For The Market And The Economy","**S&P 500 recovery on 09/5/225:** I believe that the S&P 500's recovery from the day’s low to close just 0.2% down, after a weak payrolls report of 22,000 only net new jobs in August is a perverse reaction anticipating lower interest rates, and is incorrect. 

**Bad news is bad news:** Yes, the 10 year rallied from 4.17% to close at 4.08%, boosting the S&P 500 from the day's low, but weak jobs report confirms a 4 month trend of a softening labor market, it's not a flash in a pan. Further, I don’t see any catalysts for this trend reversing. The average four month payroll growth is now just 25,000, as compared to 185,000 in the same period last year, and 186,000 in 2024. And excluding the pandemic, this is the weakest monthly job creation since 2010. 

**A reliable job sector is showing weakness:** Worse, job creation in non cyclical sectors such as elder care, healthcare, government and municipal services has slowed signifying real barriers to employment growth. Healthcare jobs have always been the growth engine and a reliable one in an aging population, thus the slowdown in this sector is foreboding. Employment in health care and social assistance rose by about 47,000 in August. That’s the smallest monthly increase since January 2022. It’s arguably a big warning sign for the wider labor market given the sector has accounted for more than 40% of all new jobs over the last three years. 

**Non-Farm payrolls was not the only sign** – The JOLTS report showed slowdowns in job openings, unemployment claims have gone up and continuing claims remain high indicating that its getting tougher to find jobs.

**What can the rate cuts do and not do?**

It helps lower the 10-year treasury yield as we saw on Friday, which in turn will reduce mortgage rates and commercial business rates.

It will help housing the most, and ease financial conditions for commercial construction and business, but this will take time to filter through.

It does not directly help job creation

It will inflate assets, especially stocks, which is dangerous.

**Avoid the FOMO and BTD impulses:** Don’t jump in because the Fed will cut in September – that’s already priced in. The Fed will cut rates of at least 25 basis points, possibly 50 at the September 17 meeting, but cuts will take time to impact growth. **What’s not priced in is a weakening economy and a much needed correction in an expensive market.** Don’t chase the rally just on lower interest rates, instead understand that a weak labor market can nudge the country into a recession. To be sure, there has never been a recession with unemployment rates below 6%, and at 4.4% there are no alarm bells, but we’re trudging in the wrong direction. Trade policy uncertainties, AI productivity improvements and DOGE cuts are taking their toll on the economy. Rate cuts may briefly lift valuations,  but you need fundamental improvements to sustain the rally.

1napdma,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 06:02:37,OPEN Reality Check: From Someone Who Actually Built the Products You're Betting On,"*TL;DR:* While I'm rooting for OPEN long-term, the current price will correct down significantly. If you have profits, seriously consider taking some. This is deep in casino mode now - be warned.

Former OPEN leader here. More importantly, I’ve diamond-handed OPEN stock for years. I rode $OPEN up, then all the way down to 50¢. If you've only been holding for weeks, listen up. (*Update*: If my background is a distraction, ignore - most of my points below are public information anyway)

I also spent years protecting regular people from financial predators. The pump-and-dump energy around OPEN right now feels very familiar.

Over the weekend I talked to a few folks ready to jump in without realizing this is pure casino mode -  that’s what pushed me to write this up. If you already know OPEN is pure casino now, no need to keep reading - you likely know the rest already or do not care.

# Where We Are: Phenomenal Momentum, Terrible Risk/Reward

The $OPEN chart might as well have 🚀 on it. Golden Cross, record volume, RSI overbought - every meme signal is flashing. So we got a whopping 10x move from 50¢ in June to $6+ now.

But here’s the problem: options even with the new peak today give you less than 20% odds of hitting $12 in the next few months. 

Translation: you might roll a 6 and 2x, but odds are higher you get smacked with a 40–50% downdraft. 

This rally is priced to flame out in weeks, not years. Think before you YOLO because your buddy doubled last week.

# What Insiders Are Actually Doing

Forget charts. Look at the people with the most information.

* **Carrie** (former CEO)**:** As soon as she was **free** to sell after leaving, she unloaded \~$35M at $5/share. Usually that’s all you need to know.
* **Shrisha** (interim CEO): Yes, bought 30k shares - first insider buy I remember. Props, but symbolic. He already had a [4,250,000](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000180116925000078/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1756411509.xml) share grant, and his cash comp just jumped by [another $500k-$1M](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000114036125033195/ef20054807_8ka.htm). A 30k buy is <1% of his stake and covered by his raise. To be clear, I'm rooting for him and have been very impressed by his leadership, but that buy isn't something you should make big bets on.
* **Veterans:** Every insider free to sell I've talked to has sold everything (except one). That includes 10-year veterans who have seen it all. And more telling: no one is buying.

Sure, insiders sell for all kinds of reasons. But here’s the pattern: nobody was buying at $2 - and they sure aren’t buying at $6–7. that tells you everything.

# Why the Bull Arguments Don't Hold Water

I hear the bull cases - “I will wait for Fed cuts / new CEO / earnings.” Here’s why they don’t stack up:

* **Rates: Already Baked In** The stock trades higher now than when rates were close to zero and Opendoor was doing 5x the revenue. A predictable 25 bps cut in two weeks? Classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” (look it up) - the price might actually drop. 
* **Q3 Earnings Will Be Brutal:** Don't take my word for it. Opendoor's own [guidance](https://www.opendoor.com/articles/2025-second-quarter-financial-results) shows revenue dropping 50% from Q2's $1.57B to just $800-875M in Q3. They also forecast returning to losses: adjusted EBITDA loss of $21-28M after barely eking out a $23M profit in Q2. How do you think retail buyers will react when earnings show a 50% revenue drop?
* **New CEO Won't Be Magic:** Short of hiring Elon Musk, no new CEO can justify a 5x-10x price jump alone. The business model challenges remain the same regardless of who's in charge. Leadership takes time. This market won’t wait.

# Bottom Line

I'm not saying OPEN is worthless or to trash the company. I genuinely want the company, and the years of work by some of the most talented people I have known, to be lasting. The Q2 2025 positive EBITDA of $23M was a monumental achievement after years of losses.

But this 1000% rally has priced in years of perfect execution. You're betting everything goes right - housing recovers, margins improve, debt becomes manageable.

Even if the next two weeks are great, the next few months will likely be ugly. Q3 earnings will show that 50% revenue drop. The new CEO search will take time. Rate cuts won't magically fix the business model. And when reality hits, this thing will fall fast.

**If you have profits:** Take some off the table. Insiders sold at well below $5, you're sitting at $6-7.

**If you believe long-term:** Wait for a better entry point. This isn't your last chance.

**If you're speculating:** Set stops and don't risk money you can't lose.

I know I'll get hate from true believers (whom I respect) and from pumpers looking for exit liquidity. That's fine. Call me a pessimist or worse - that's better than watching ordinary people get wrecked.

> Nestle has fired its chief executive after just one year in the job because he failed to disclose a ""romantic relationship"" with a ""direct subordinate"". The Swiss food giant, which makes Kit Kat chocolate bars and Nespresso coffee capsules, said Laurent Freixe had been dismissed with ""immediate effect"" following an investigation led by Nestle's chair and lead independent director. The BBC understands the inquiry was triggered by a report made through the company's whistleblowing channel. Nestle chair Paul Bulcke said: ""This was a necessary decision. Nestle's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestle.""

> The relationship was with an employee who is not on the executive board and the investigation began because it represented a conflict of interest, the BBC has learned. As well as Mr Bulcke, independent director Pablo Isla oversaw the inquiry into Mr Freixe ""with the support of independent outside counsel"". The Financial Times has reported that concerns were raised about Mr Freixe's relationship with an employee earlier this year and, after an internal investigation, the claims were found to be unsubstantiated. After the complaints persisted, the newspaper reports that Nestle conducted another investigation with help from outside counsel after which the claims were upheld. A spokesperson for Nestle said: ""We acted at all times in line with best practice corporate governance.",1551,133,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n9n3w3/nestle_has_fired_its_ceo_because_he_failed_to/,new,Company News,0.98
1n9jpac,2025-09-05,2025-09-05 18:57:15,"Kinsale Capital Group ($KNSL) - Expensive on the surface, a long term high quality growth opportunity underneath","Disclaimer: I currently own a small tracker position <1% of my portfolio. Looking to increase to a 15-20% position over the coming months to year.

Kinsale Capital ($KNSL) is a lesser known name in the property and casualty (P&C) insurance space. Formed in 2009 by founder and CEO Michael Kehoe (see speech from him on YT talking on Baron conference) with others from James River, the company went public in 2016 and has since delivered a ~22X return for investors since IPO. I believe this company has much more room for growth, and the recent multiple compression occurring over the last 2 years due to no significant share price movement offers a good entry point for new long term investors.

Kinsale Capital is the only publicly traded pure play excess and surplus (E&S) insurer of P&C. Basically for those that don't follow the insurance industry, this is a ""niche"" insurance market for risk that the standard market cannot bear, underwrite or price. This market has a total adressable value of >115B. It's for policies that carry too much risk or are so unconventional that no standard insurer (i.e. Progressive, Libery Mutual, GEICO...) in the admitted market will accept it. Think risky buisnesses like a night club in a rough part of town, a weapons manufacturer, a demolitions company, or a business that has already made multiple claims in the past. Where standard insurers turn away from this risk, Kinsale steps in. The E&S market is not limited by regulations and policies as compared to the standard market, and Kinsale is allowed to thereby create its own prices to fully adjust for the risk it bears and add significant exclusions to its policies to limit risk.

Anywho, Kehoe discusses the business quite well in his speech from the Baron conference, so you can get a more detailed idea by watching the video.

Sounds great? What's the catch?

The company has historically traded at a significant premium valuation for an insurance/financial business, which I believe is why the stock has been relatively stagnant since October 2023. It has had two short thesis written on it on VIC and have heard of other shorts explaining their thesis on YouTube. Shorts have thus far not succeeded in their plays. Its 5 year average trailing PE has hovered around 38, and forward PE of 34. It has also carried a significant price to book premium of 7-8x, as compared to most insurance carriers at 1-2x.

Since October 2023 with no significant movement in share price, the multiples have compressed as the buisness continues to grow. The trailing and fwd PE now hovers around 24, and price to book has contracted to a, still frothy, 6x.

My thesis lies in my conviction that this premium is well justified. Following Buffets timeless saying, own wonderful businesses at fair prices, as compared to fair businesses at wonderful prices.

There are several factors that stand out with Kinsale which I believe justify it's high valuation. The company is growing significantly faster than most insurance carriers. Net income and underwriting income y/y continues to grow at rates from 25-45%. The ROE sits comfortably around 30%. The company also has a combined ratio, the primary metric used by insurance carriers to show profitability after accounting for claims payouts and business expenses, of astounding percentages in the mid-70s. As of the most recent quarter, 75.8% - this is practically unheard of in the insurance business. Most insurers average in the low to mid 90s (lower is better, indicating more profitability. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit while combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss).

The company operates a lean, low cost business model and only has about 700 full time employees. Kehoe has stated that they are very disciplined in their underwriting and carry conservative loss reserves. The E&S space continues to also grow annually in the low teens, roughly double that of the standard P&C space in the mid single digits. Kehoe further describes a business quality that other insurers don't have is a contemporary and centralized software to process claims quickly, where other insurers who rely on M&A must compile data across many legacy platforms that decrease efficiency and time to process claims. Kehoe also has a large shareholder incentive as the majority of his wealth is tied to Kinsale, as Chris Mayer says, skin in the game - Kehoe owns about 3.8% of the company. Finally, the company appears to have significant room for growth, as they only hold about 1.4% of the TAM of E&S policies based on their financial presentation.

While I don't think Kinsale is a screaming buy, I believe this is a good entry point for a long term position that will continue to show positive and upward momentum in the next 5-10 years.

Risks:

- Continues to carry a premium valuation despite recent years multiple compression, still holds P/B of 6x, well above industry peers

- Recent decline in growth of their largest line, commercial property, though all other lines continue to grow at ~15%

- Operates in a risky and litigious insurance space, battles with many litigations over claims

Look at the manufacturing sector, the biggest victim of tariffs. Not only have tariffs failed to help them recover, but high raw material prices have also destroyed their competitiveness. Is this something that cutting interest rates can fix? Sigh.

This is the only time that I've seen so many inverse things happen like this.

* Giving a founder additional shares to do his job just to motivate him when the majority of his wealth is based on Tesla in the first place, Refreshers are normal and option plans are normal, but needing 1T worth of them is not.
* They think that old Elon who used to captivate an audience through being progressive and promoting the future... will somehow return (not only has he lost steam for promising lofty ideas but people are finally tired of broken promises by him, every year its another almost there target for self driving. Also where is the new roadster?)
* Everyone is tired of Elon standing on stage trying to compute how to speak  as he jumps around and does salutes ""as a joke""  vs someone who sits back and builds out the company to its full potential
* The company still caters to a a high end, well educated consumer for their products. As soon as he lost the base for it he did all the damage control he could. He literally tried to have Trump sell his cars on the Whitehouse green, that's how desperate its got for him crying on twitch (a gaming platform) about people hating him.
* The board of directors is  stacked in his favor but also is so fearful of him that they won't standup to him. They at least have enough of a spine to make sure he hits targets to get his package. Although he will never meet those goals so I guess if you are an Elon Supporter this is great news (your lord is staying around) if you are inbetween you know what you are getting and if you hate him, well he has a giant carrot Infront of him to do something.

I think that the pay package is so strange as somehow he will recover the mess he created. If I joined a company (as Elon joined Tesla, he didn't create it) then got it to the position where he risked everything to make it the brand/success it is, then tanked it by his political/ketamine rants, then was offered 1T to act normal and bring it all back.... I'd be the luckiest person on earth. This story is bonkers.

**I'd rather see they pay someone a 1 trillion dollar pay package to wipe Elon's image out of the Tesla picture or** associated with Elon. A rebrand to being progressive, for human rights, and a environmental company .

This is the strangest pay package I've ever seen. The bottom line is, if they hired any reputable CEO that can re-establish the brand of being a modern, progressive company, they would be back on track, not trying to force this monstrosity back into its cage with money.

Tesla in Europe, China, and even North America sales are steadily declining, tax credit offsets are ending, the company needs a new face, and Elon is the worst way to promote what was once the progressive movement.

EDIT:  
To everyone saying that if they don't offer this up he'll leave and either start another competitor or destroy the brand. The issue is the brand is destroyed already by someone who tweets about illegal aliens and governement conspiracies all day and night. How has his ventures gone since he became the DOGE psychopath? XAi is a dumster fire of VC money, Boring Company has.... built a tunnel under vegas convention center that has human drivers for robo taxi's, sales have steadily declined, solar and battery have been taken over by other companies, uhhh what am I missing?

There are only few (like 3/4 ?) manufacturers of storage. STX, WD, Toshiba being the major ones.

If yes, how come these stocks are down ? recent revenues were down but isn't that like ignoring the potential demand from AI requirements ?

Alphabet Inc.’s Google was fined almost €3 billion ($3.5 billion) by the European Union and ordered to stop favoring its own advertising technology services, in a move that risks further inflaming tensions with US President Donald Trump.
The European Commission said Friday that Google had abused its dominance by giving its own ad exchanges a competitive advantage over rivals and that it must bring the practices to an end.

“When markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power,” EU antitrust commissioner Teresa Ribera said in a statement. “True freedom means a level playing field, where everyone competes on equal terms and citizens have a genuine right to choose.”

The company immediately vowed to appeal. Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice president for regulatory affairs at Google, said the move “imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money.”

The EU punishment comes at a tense moment for EU–US trade relations, with Trump repeatedly deriding the bloc’s efforts to rein in Silicon Valley giants. Although Google faces antitrust scrutiny worldwide, it won some relief this week when a US judge ruled that its search business would not need to be broken up to address the harms alleged by the Department of Justice.

Google’s adtech operations, however, also remain under threat in the US. The DOJ is expected to file proposed remedies later on Friday, ahead of a Sept. 22 hearing on those proposals. Previously, the department had floated forcing Google to divest its Ad Manager platform to tackle the alleged anticompetitive risks.

The EU warned Google in 2023 that it had abused its dominance in advertising technology to harm online publishers. At the time, the Brussels-based commission said Google had favored its own ad exchange program over its rivals and bolstered the company’s central role in the ad tech supply chain.
Ribera’s predecessor Margrethe Vestager warned then that only a “mandatory divestment” of part of its business would solve the issues. The Dane had spent a decade in Brussels, where she hit Google with fines of more than €8 billion across three different cases, although one penalty was annulled and another cut by EU judges.",710,216,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n98aaa/google_fined_almost_3_billion_by_eu_for_abusing/,new,Company News,0.95

You may remember me from such classics as “$LULU - the bar is low” where I mentioned that I had a $1 million investment in Lulu stock at $205.

I went through the numbers and listened in on the call, and while I feel there is some turbulence ahead, I feel that it’s not all doom and gloom.

1) Tariffs have hurt, but the de minimis exemption removal was particularly painful. Increasing prices in a softening macro isn’t the way to do it, but price increases will come as rate cuts boost the economy. There is also a wild card out here: the Supreme Court may rule the tariffs illegal and order all tariffs collected to be refunded. Lutnick’s own ex-firm, which is being run by his sons, is reportedly betting on this outcome.

2) Management has had their “come to Jesus” moment. Calvin has done well and presided over massive growth, but I think they got a little too cocky. No doubt he is feeling the pressure over the 67% stock slump, and they will shake things up now and go back to what made them great to begin with. More product innovation, more technical apparel, and more frequent refreshes. They can’t just introduce a slightly different color for a model of leggings and call it a day. 

3) An activist could get involved, which could likely be Chip Wilson, the founder and a major shareholder. Chip built this company from scratch and has an uncanny sense of what the consumer wants. The last time Lulu slipped up (2018) Chip tried to buy it out. He didn’t succeed, but the changes he demanded resulted in a 10x of the stock.

4) The stock has never been this cheap; it’s at a low teens PE. Yes, the E may fall a bit more, but Lulu has $1.2 billion in cash and they’ve been actively buying back shares. If they reduce capex (they should, no need to grow store count during this time) they can direct free cash to buying up cheap shares and increasing EPS metrics.

5) Their main competitor, Alo, is not public yet. They’re spending balls-to-the-wall on influencers in order to goose their revenue so they get a higher multiple for their IPO. However, Alo has much higher CAQ and lower customer retention than Lulu, so it’s not sustainable.

By the way, before anyone declares them dead, they will have $11 BILLION in sales this year and they are very profitable.

**The Bear Case: Heavy Cash Burn and Dilution**

**Massive Cash Burn:** Archer is losing ~$500M in free cash flow annually. Scaling aircraft manufacturing is extremely capital intensive & it may be years before the company can generate positive cash flow

**Dilution Risk:** Shares outstanding are up more than 50% YoY as the company raised $850M last quarter. This shareholder dilution could continue as Archer funds its manufacturing buildout.

**Execution Risk:** To cover its expenses, Archer would need to deliver 300+ Midnight aircraft annually, far above the 50 planned in the near term. Any delays in certification or ramp up could extend losses and erode investor confidence.


**The Bull Case: Strategic Backers and Market Potential**

**Strong Investors:** Boeing, United Airlines, Stellantis, and ARK Invest are all backing Archer. This validation from major aviation players gives credibility to its long-term vision.

**Cash Runway:** With $1.7B on the balance sheet, Archer has several years of runway to prove itself, even at the current burn rate.

**Commercial Opportunities:** Initial deliveries to Abu Dhabi Aviation, plans for taxi routes at the LA 2028 Olympics, and potential defense contracts with Anduril offer multiple paths to revenue.

**Urban Mobility Moat:** If eVTOL becomes mainstream, Archer could benefit from first-mover advantage in building networks in cities where time savings (10min flights vs. hour long drives) have clear value

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/time-to-buy-the-dip-on-archer-aviation-stock-below-10/ar-AA1LR8n0?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds

**My Take:**
At under $10, Archer offers exposure to a potentially transformative technology but comes with serious risks. The high burn rate and reliance on capital raises make it vulnerable, yet the backing of large industry players and its international traction provide a real (though speculative) upside case

For me, this falls into the optionality bucket it could be a multi bagger if execution goes right or a value trap if certification drags and dilution continues

**Questions for the community:**

-Do you believe Archer can realistically ramp from 50 aircraft per year to 300+ within a decade?

-How do you handicap the probability of FAA approval by 2028?

-Would you treat ACHR as a venture style bet/ does the dilution risk outweigh the upside?

The proposed compensation plan for Musk, already the world’s wealthiest individual, consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. It would also give Musk increased voting power over the EV maker and aspiring robotics titan, which he has publicly demanded since early 2024.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Here’s how the chipmaker did versus LSEG consensus estimates:

The company topped second-quarter earnings estimates but slightly missed revenue expectations. But it said it expected tariffs to hit its full-year profits by $240 million.

Here’s how the company did for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: $3.10 vs. $2.88 expected
* Revenue: $2.53 billion vs. $2.54 billion expected

“While we continued to see positive momentum overall in our international regions in the second quarter, we are disappointed with our U.S. business results and aspects of our product execution,” CEO Calvin McDonald said in a statement.

Shares of the company sank more than 10% after the bell Thursday. The stock is down more than 45% this year.

The company reported second-quarter net income of $370.9 million, or $3.10 per share, compared to $392.92 million, or $3.15 per share, in the year-ago period.

Same-store sales in the Americas were down 4%. Overall comparable sales increased just 1% compared to Wall Street estimates of 2.2%.

It projects third-quarter revenues will be between $2.47 billion and $2.50 billion compared to Wall Street estimates of $2.57 billion. The company said it expects earnings per share in the next quarter to be between $2.18 and $2.23 per share, compared to an estimate of $2.93 per share.

Gap released their denim ad with Katseye 2 weeks ago.

There’s a ton of analysis from marketing professionals praising Gap’s ability to capture the momentum from the Sydney Sweeney ad and put out something that appears to be much more successful and effective. 

Gap has been on an uptrend since their last earnings, and I’m confident the virality of the Katseye ad paired with the now proven effectiveness of the Sydney Sweeney ad through AEO’s earnings will keep Gap’s momentum going.

Meanwhile, the market is underappreciating the rising quality of Google’s ad leads, which will cause pricing to go up, providing another tailwind for the stock.

Mahaney’s current price target for the stock sits at $240 per share, implying an upside of 13%. But he believes shares could eventually rise to around the $300 level, which is approximately 42% than where shares are currently trading.

Mahaney added that this ruling is also a “big win” for Apple.

“This has clearly been an overhang on Apple stock, and now they’ve got this almost guaranteed $20, $25 billion a year, and super high margin revenue coming their way thanks to Google,” he said.

1n7q8at,2025-09-03,2025-09-03 16:36:50,Salesforce issues weak revenue guidance even as earnings beat estimates,"Salesforce issued disappointing guidance on Wednesday, even as earnings and revenue topped estimates for the fiscal second quarter. The stock dropped 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.91 adjusted vs. $2.78 expected
* **Revenue:** $10.24 billion vs. $10.14 billion expected

Revenue increased 10% from $9.33 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income rose to $1.89 billion, or $1.96 per share, from $1.43 billion, or $1.47 per share, a year ago.

For the fiscal third quarter, management called for $2.84 to $2.86 in adjusted earnings per share on $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had been looking for $2.85 per share on $10.29 billion in revenue.

Salesforce maintained its full-year revenue outlook but now sees higher earnings. The company is targeting $11.33 to $11.37 in adjusted earnings per share on $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion in revenue. The consensus estimate from LSEG was $11.31 in earnings per share and $41.2 billion in revenue. The forecast in May included $11.27 to  $11.33 in adjusted earnings per share.

Salesforce has fallen out of favor on Wall Street this year due to an extended stretch of meager revenue growth, which has been stuck in the single digits since mid-2024. While the company regularly touts its investments in artificial intelligence and the advancements in its software and systems, it hasn’t been lifted by the AI boom in the same way as many of its tech peers.

Going into Wednesday’s report, Salesforce was down 23% for the year, lagging behind all but one stock in the Dow and trailing all other large-cap tech companies.

The ratio of Salesforce’s enterprise value to its free cash flow has reached a 10-year low because of fears of disruption from AI, according to analysts at Jefferies, who have a buy rating on the stock. Salesforce is trying to counter the pressure by selling its Agentforce AI software that can automate the handling of customer service questions.

During the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce said it was planning to increase the cost of some products and announced its intent to acquire data management software company Informatica for $8 billion.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** breakeven
* **Revenue:** $249.6 million vs. $248.8 million expected

Revenue increased 41% year over year in the second quarter from a year earlier, Figma said in a statement. The company provided a preliminary estimate of $247 million to $250 million in a July regulatory filing. CNBC isn’t including a profit estimate because it’s Figma’s first earnings report.

Net income totaled $846,000, compared with a loss of $827.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. The company’s adjusted operating income came to $11.5 million, after Figma provided a prior estimate of $9 million to $12 million.

For the third quarter, Figma forecast revenue of between $263 million and $265 million, which would represent about 33% growth at the middle of the range. The LSEG consensus was $256.8 million.

The company sees between $88 million and $98 million in adjusted operating income for the full year and a little over $1.02 billion in revenue. The revenue range implies about 37% growth and is above the $1.01 billion LSEG consensus.

In the second quarter, Figma announced Figma Make, which uses artificial intelligence to compose app and website designs based on a user’s descriptions, and Figma Sites, which turns designs into working websites. The company also acquired vector graphics startup Modyfi and content management system startup Payload.

A number of software vendors have faced pressure this year due to concerns surrounding AI and whether it will displace business. Figma co-founder and CEO Dylan Field said he’s not seeing that play out internally and that, if anything, the role of designers will only become more critical.

“I think that the more that software becomes easier to build with AI, the more that people are going to see that that human touch is needed,” Field said. He acknowledged that Figma has been adopting so-called vibe-coding tools for AI-driven software development.

Figma reported a 129% net retention rate, a reflection of expansion with existing customers. The figure was down from 132% in the first quarter.

Following its IPO, Figma expects a share sale lockup to expire for 25% some employees’ stock after market close on Sept. 4. Investors holding just over half of Figma’s outstanding Class A stock have agreed to an extended lock-up that will expire in August 2026 for about 35% of their shares.

Field said he wanted to provide clarity for investors.

“That’s something that I think is valuable information,” he said.

On Wednesday the company’s stock closed at $68.13. The company priced shares in its IPO at $33, and saw the stock pop to $115.50 in its debut.

The company’s splashy, yet controversial, campaign with the “Euphoria” star led to some criticism and blowback but the launch, coupled with a recent partnership with Taylor Swift’s new fiancé Travis Kelce, has led to new customer acquisition and positive traffic across channels. 

American Eagle stock soared more than 20% in after-hours trading Wednesday.

“The fall season is off to a positive start. Fueled by stronger product offerings and the success of recent marketing campaigns with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce, we have seen an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales,” CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a news release. “We look forward to building on our progress and the continued strength of our iconic brands to drive higher profitability, long-term growth and shareholder value.” 

The company also re-issued its full-year guidance after withdrawing it earlier this year. It now expects comparable sales to be approximately flat, better than the 0.2% decline analysts had anticipated, according to StreetAccount. 

It still expects gross margin to be down for the duration of the year, but it made key changes to its outlook for operating income, which is bearing the brunt of the tariff impact. The company is now expecting its full-year operating income to be between $255 million and $265 million, down from a previous range of between $360 million and $375 million. 

Here’s how American Eagle performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 45 cents vs. 21 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $1.28 billion vs. $1.24 billion expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $77.6 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with $77.3 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales fell to $1.28 billion, down slightly from $1.29 billion a year earlier. 

For the current quarter, American Eagle is expecting comparable sales to be up in the low single digit range, better than the 0.9% uptick analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. It’s expecting the same trend during the fourth quarter.

> WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing contracted for a sixth straight month in August as factories dealt with the fallout from the Trump administration's import tariffs, with some manufacturers describing the current business environment as ""much worse than the Great Recession.""
> 
> The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Tuesday also showed some manufacturers complaining that the sweeping import duties were making it difficult to manufacture goods in the United States. President Donald Trump has defended his protectionist trade policy, which has raised the nation's average tariff rate to the highest in a century, as necessary to revive a long-declining U.S. industrial base.
> 
> That was reinforced by government data showing spending on the construction of factories dropped in July and was down 6.7% from a year ago. A U.S. appeals court ruled last Friday that most of Trump's tariffs were illegal, adding more uncertainty for businesses.
> 
> ""I continue to see the broad economy generally and the manufacturing sector in particular as in a holding pattern until tariff-related uncertainty recedes,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander U.S. Capital Markets.
> 
> The ISM said its manufacturing PMI edged up to 48.7 last month from 48.0 in July. A PMI reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for 10.2% of the economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PMI would rise to 49.0.
> 
> Seven industries, including textile mills, miscellaneous manufacturing and primary metals, reported growth last month. Among the 10 industries reporting contraction were makers of paper products, machinery, electrical equipment, appliances and components as well as computer and electronic products.
> 
> Tariffs continued to dominate commentary from manufacturers. Some makers of transportation equipment said conditions were worse than the 2007-09 recession, adding ""there is absolutely no activity"" and ""this is 100 percent attributable to current tariff policy and the uncertainty it has created."" Some viewed the conditions as consistent with ""stagflation.""
> 
> Some electrical equipment, appliances and components producers complained that ""'made in the USA' has become even more difficult due to tariffs on many components."" They said the ""administration wants manufacturing jobs in the U.S., but we are losing higher-skilled and higher-paying roles."" Others reported that because of the lack of ""stability in trade and economics, capital expenditures spending and hiring are frozen.""

Webull (BULL) is currently trading around 13.2/share. It IPOd on 11Apr right at market lows. There was immediate interest sending the IPO price from $12 to $60, then a sell off to $11. 

Financials: 
Revenue Q1 = $117M
Revenue Q2 = $131.5M
Q3 projection = $150M 

Yes they have competition from other brokerages, but their market edge is lower trading fees and easy to use app. They now also permit other forms of trading which im not allowed to specify on this sub. 

So why webull? 

If you do a simple Revenue vs. Market cap comparison of brokerages, Webull is by far the most undervalued brokerage - likely because they recently had smaller market exposure pre-IPO and the IPO timing was horrible. 

Webull would be trading at $39/share using a revenue vs market cap vs. Share price comparison to other brokerages (aggregate). 

In other words, if Webulls financials were treated the same as other brokerages, it should simply be close to $40/share. 

$13/share is outrageously undervalued for this brokerage. Time and value will realize itself and Webull will be trading at $40/share soon. Just a matter of time.

Waller proceeded to lecture the audience that what people don't understand is ""see through inflation"".  He said people don't understand that this is just temporary and caused by tariffs and you need to see through it and it will soon go away.  I guess by magic,  he didn't say what would cause it to go away.

The department store operator also raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance. It now expects adjusted earnings of between $1.70 and $2.05 per share, compared with $1.60 to $2 per share, and revenue between $21.15 billion and $21.45 billion, compared with $21 billion to $21.4 billion.

The stock surged 20% in early trading on Wednesday.

Macy’s had slashed its full-year guidance last quarter and reported uncertainty in sales due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

“We’re just well positioned right now for the environment we’re in to take share, to deliver for our customers and to provide a better experience,” CEO Tony Spring told CNBC in an interview.

Last quarter, the company said it was hiking prices of certain products to offset tariff costs. Spring said Wednesday that the company now has tariff impacts included in its outlook and remains cautiously optimistic about the future.

“Tariffs are real. It’s a component of the business, but we have tail winds that we are trying to mitigate against those headwinds,” Spring said. “That’s a better customer experience, that’s a newer assortment, that’s less redundancy in our assortment, that’s now a business that’s growing across all three nameplates in our portfolio and a healthy inventory position going into the fall season.”

Spring added that the consumer remains resilient and continues to spend on new items and fashion.

Macy’s said it saw its best comparable sales growth in 12 quarters, and Spring said the retailer’s strategy is leaning into business segments that are working to keep its momentum going, including growth in denim, women’s contemporary apparel and watches.

Here’s how the company performed during its fiscal second quarter, compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 41 cents adjusted vs. 18 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $4.81 billion vs. $4.76 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Aug. 2, the company’s net income was $87 million, or 31 cents per share, compared with $150 million, or 53 cents per share, the year prior. Net sales dropped from $4.94 billion in the year-ago period to $4.81 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were 41 cents.

Macy’s said the group of 125 stores that the company has chosen to focus on with higher staffing and renovations, outperformed the broader Macy’s brand, seeing comparable sales growth of 1.1% on an owned basis.

The department store also owns Bloomingdale’s, which reported comparable sales growth of 3.6% on an owned basis, and Bluemercury, which saw comparable sales rise 1.2%. Those two brands have consistently performed better than the Macy’s namesake stores.

The company also reported a $28 million increase in credit card net revenue to $153 million.

“When you think about the strength of a department store or a marketplace, it’s when multiple categories are working,” Spring said Wednesday.

CFO Tom Edwards said on a call with analysts on Wednesday that Macy’s is exploring more price hikes on certain products because of tariffs.

“We’re adjusting prices, but as appropriate, not broad-based and really assessing it with our partners in an effort to remain competitive,” Edwards said. “I believe that we are really well positioned to navigate through this time given our business model.”

Here are a few that stood out to me (data from Finviz / company filings):

APP (Applovin): +36% YTD; EPS +102% this year; sales growth +34% YoY; forward P/E ~32.8

DASH (DoorDash): +47% YTD; EPS up ~750%; revenue +23.8% YoY; forward P/E ~63

CVNA (Carvana): +76% YTD; EPS growth +170%; sales +39.5% YoY; forward P/E ~117

NET (Cloudflare): +82% YTD; +138% 1-year return; forward P/E ~176.7

PINS (Pinterest): EPS +41%; profit margin ~49%; sales +17% YoY; forward P/E ~16.6

These are all strong movers, but the valuations range wildly…Some look like they still have room to run, while others may already be stretched…

But, take ORLY for example at a PE of 37 and market cap of $88 billion (bigger than either Ford or GM or Cummins).

Net income 2021 - 2024 up from $2.16 to $2.39 billion (only 10% increase).  CPI inflation is more than that (18.5% since Dec-2021).   This even when their store count is up by over 10% over the same period.  They are not growing like a tech company despite their 37 PE.

Long term debt up from $3.8  -  $5.5 billion (50% increase).

Their earnings per share have increased, as they buy back shares rather then pay dividends.  Though it seems like much of those purchases are funded by added debt.

1n6wf9c,2025-09-02,2025-09-02 17:38:00,"Waymo starts testing in Denver, Seattle in bid to expand robotaxi service across U.S.","Alphabet’s Waymo unit will begin test drives of its robotaxis in Denver and Seattle this week, with humans behind the wheel, the company said on Tuesday.

“We will begin driving manually before validating our technology and operations for fully autonomous services in the future,” a company spokesperson said in an email. Waymo announced the tests in blog posts.

The autonomous vehicle venture aims to expand its driverless, ride-hailing service across the U.S. after already launching commercial operations in Austin, Texas, as well as Atlanta, San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles.

In some markets, including Austin and Atlanta, Waymo’s driverless rides can only be hailed through the Uber app. In others, riders must use the company’s standalone Waymo One app to book a robotaxi.

Safety drivers, who are employees of Waymo, will man the steering and braking behind the test vehicles in Denver and Seattle. The company is also running similar tests with its robotaxis in New York, having recently obtained permits in the biggest U.S. market.

The company’s test fleet in Denver and in Seattle will include a mix of their fully electric Jaguar iPace and Geely Zeekr AVs.

Waymo told CNBC that it will have up to a dozen cars each in Denver and Seattle to start testing.

Waymo’s primary competition on the global stage is Baidu-owned Apollo Go in China, which operates driverless ride-hailing services throughout Asia. Meanwhile, Tesla has obtained a permit to operate a ride-hailing business in Texas, and is testing a manned robotaxi service in Austin and another in San Francisco.

In a landmark case filed in 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that Google kept its share of the general search market by creating strong barriers to entry and a feedback loop that sustained its dominance.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in August 2024 that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which outlaws monopolies, saying the company has held an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search.

Google said it will appeal the ruling, which would delay any potential penalties.

1n6udom,2025-09-02,2025-09-02 16:19:23,"September feels heavy: seasonality, tariffs, shutdown talk, and Fed nerves all hitting at once","The market kicked off weak this week with the Nasdaq, S&P, and Dow all sliding lower. Honestly, it feels like there are too many headwinds piling up at the same time, and no one can agree on which one is the real driver.

September is usually a bad month for stocks anyway, especially for tech. Maybe this is just the classic seasonal slump playing out. But it also feels like the other stuff going on is making it worse. A federal appeals court just ruled most of Trump’s tariffs were illegal, which doesn’t kill tariffs forever but does leave everything messy. Nobody knows what the new rules will look like, which goods are impacted, or if companies might even get refunds for what’s already been collected. That kind of limbo is exactly what markets hate.

Then there’s the government shutdown risk. Congress has until September 30 to figure it out, and the odds of a shutdown are being thrown around at 40 percent. If it happens, you could see cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which would ripple through the economy. Maybe they pass a short-term patch that drags this into December, but even the back-and-forth in DC is enough to make investors nervous.

The Fed adds another layer. Nobody’s sure what their next move is, and stocks entered September priced for perfection, so the bar is high. When valuations are stretched like this, even a little bit of bad news can knock things down. Add in the jobs report coming on Friday, and you’ve got another potential swing factor hanging over the week.

So yeah, between seasonality, tariffs, shutdown talk, and Fed uncertainty, the market just feels heavy right now. I’m curious what everyone thinks is weighing the most. Are you making moves in your portfolio, or just sitting back and treating this like a normal September dip that will pass?",71,35,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n6udom/september_feels_heavy_seasonality_tariffs/,new,Unknown,0.73

My understanding is that we have 3 options.

Option 1, peg gold at its current price, and don’t address the deficit immediately.  This would require a period of extreme austerity and fiscal discipline.

Option 2, peg gold at an extremely high price like $130K per ounce to wipe out the deficit.  This would make the dollar practically worthless.

Option 3, we remain a fiat currency.  According to the Triffin dilemma, we have to continue running trade deficits so the world can accumulate enough dollars to create liquidity.  But over time, confidence in the currency erodes gradually since the dollar is backed less and less by real assets and is backed more by trust.",0,25,0,stocks,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n6siqs/what_are_the_chances_of_the_us_going_back_to_the/,new,Unknown,0.18

The stock finished down about 8% after the company cut its fiscal 2026 outlook. Analysts figured a trim was coming, but the size of the cut was worse than anyone expected.

Management blamed softer consumer demand, and distributors will likely have to rebalance inventories. Bloomberg Intelligence pointed right at beer sales as the main problem, which is surprising since beer has usually been Constellation’s strongest category.

The bigger question is what this says about the consumer. If people are pulling back on beer, even from a major player like STZ, does that mean discretionary spending is weakening more broadly? Or is this just a company-specific stumble? Either way, the reaction shows just how quickly investors will punish consumer names when demand looks shaky.

Is this the start of a larger trend, or just Constellation having a bad quarter?

1n6m0en,2025-09-02,2025-09-02 11:06:24,Paramount and Activision partner on Call of Duty live-action film,"Call of Duty, one of the most successful video game franchises of all time, will be coming to the big screen with the help of Paramount.

The studio announced Tuesday that it had inked a deal with Microsoft-owned Activision to develop, produce and distribute a live-action feature film based on the first-person shooter game.

“As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty this is truly a dream come true,” David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, said in a statement. “From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love.”

Paramount and Activision said they will honor the brand’s “rich narrative and distinctive style” for fans of the video game franchise. Call of Duty has been the best-selling video game series in the U.S. for 16 consecutive years, with more than 500 million copies sold globally.

“I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand,” Ellison said.

The deal is yet another major announcement from Paramount since it officially merged with Skydance in early August. Weeks later the studio announced it had signed The Duffer Brothers, the creative team of Matt and Ross Duffer who created Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” to a four-year agreement for feature films, television and streaming projects.

Paramount also bought the U.S. rights to UFC in a $7.7 billion, 7-year deal that starts in 2026.

Ellison said in an open letter shortly after the merger that the company would invest in “high-quality storytelling and cutting-edge technology” to help “define the next era of entertainment.”

1n6lf3n,2025-09-02,2025-09-02 10:44:17,Warren Buffett says he is ‘disappointed’ in Kraft Heinz split; shares fall 5%,"Warren Buffett told CNBC on Tuesday that he is disappointed in the Kraft Heinz split that unwinds much of the blockbuster merger he masterminded a decade ago.

With a 27.5% stake in the company, Berkshire Hathaway is Kraft Heinz’s largest shareholder. The firm has not touched its shares since the 2015 merger that formed the food conglomerate.

Shares of the company fell more than 3% following Buffett’s comments.

Buffett told CNBC’s Becky Quick on Tuesday that the merger didn’t turn out to be a brilliant idea, but he does not think that taking the company apart will fix its problems.

Greg Abel, who will take reins at Berkshire Hathaway from Buffett at the end of the year, expressed disappointment to Kraft Heinz, according to Buffett.

Kraft Heinz did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Buffett’s stance on the deal.

The split announced earlier on Tuesday once again separates Kraft Heinz into two companies: one focused on sauces, spreads and shelf-stable meals and a second that includes North American staples like Oscar Mayer, Kraft singles and Lunchables.

Berkshire Hathaway teamed up with private equity firm 3G Capital in 2015 to merge Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. 3G Capital quietly exited its Kraft Heinz investment in 2023, after years of periodically trimming its stake as the company struggled.

Though it holds a roster of iconic brands like Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, Kraft Heinz saw its U.S. sales slip just a few years after the merger. Health-conscious consumers were buying less packaged food and shopping more around the perimeter of the grocery store. Some analysts also blamed the company’s slump on cost-cutting measures that kept Kraft Heinz from investing in its brands at a time when they needed it most.

In an effort to turn around the business, Kraft Heinz sold off some of its portfolio, like Planters nuts and some of its cheese division. The company has also been investing in some of its brands, like Lunchables and Capri Sun. In May, Kraft Heinz executives said that the company was weighing strategic changes and potential transactions.

Even as other investors have lost faith in Kraft Heinz, Buffett has stood by the company.

Regarding Berkshire’s future as a Kraft Heinz investor, Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire will do whatever is in the best interest of the firm. If Berkshire is approached to sell its shares, the firm will not accept a block bid unless other shareholders receive the same offer, according to Buffett.

1n6kqml,2025-09-02,2025-09-02 10:18:21,"Musk looks past Tesla sales slump, says 80% of value will come from Optimus","Tesla CEO Elon Musk predicted that Optimus robots, which have yet to hit the market, will eventually make up more than three-quarters of his automaker’s value.

In a post on X on Monday, Musk wrote, ”\~80% of Tesla’s value will be Optimus.” In mid-2024, Musk predicted that Optimus robots would someday turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company, which was equal to more than half of the entire value of the S&P 500 at the time of his comment.

With Tesla in the midst of a multi-quarter sales slump due to competition from lower-cost Chinese competitors, an aging lineup of electric vehicles and Musk’s incendiary political rhetoric and involvement with the Trump administration, the world’s richest person has been trying to convince Wall Street to look to the future.

For Tesla, that dream revolves around a world filled with robotaxis and humanoid robots, powered by artificial intelligence.

“It is important to note that Tesla is by far the best in the world at real-world AI,” Musk said in the company’s second-quarter conference call with analysts in July.

The problem for Tesla is that it’s behind in those key markets.

In robotaxis, Tesla has only recently started tests in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, while Alphabet’s Waymo is live in numerous markets and reached 10 million paid trips in May. Baidu’s Apollo Go is live in China.

Meanwhile, competition in humanoid robots is coming from the likes of Chinese companies like Unitree, which won multiple medals at the World Humanoid Robot Games. Others in the space include Boston Dynamics, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, 1X and Figure.

Musk said in March that Tesla plans to make 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year. In its first-quarter shareholder deck, Tesla said it was on target for “builds of Optimus on our Fremont pilot production line in 2025, with wider deployment of bots doing useful work across our factories.”

Tesla recently lost the person running the division.

Milan Kovac, Tesla’s vice president of Optimus robotics, announced his departure in June after nine years at the company.

Tesla is developing Optimus with the aim of someday selling it as a bipedal, intelligent robot capable of everything from factory work to babysitting.
