1m1v2h7,2025-07-16,2025-07-16 21:50:44,Notes From a Multimillionaire Trader,"Long-term investing can dwarf what you make from trading. Know what you can trade, and what you mustn’t trade (PLTR).

Trading for a living still feels like an ordinary job. 

As I come tantalizingly close to $4 million, I don’t feel any different than when I had $1 million, or $500,000. I don’t live any differently. I don’t spend any more money. I'm not any happier.

There are only one or two brief periods in an entire year that are suitable for trading. Sometimes there are none. Unsuccessful traders tend to press as many buttons as possible as often as possible. Successful traders trade very reluctantly. 

Learn to read SPY, QQQ, and market internals. Then, and only then, find a stock showing (true, not imaginary) relative strength. Compare lots of them. Focus on market leaders. 

If something keeps working, keep doing it. If it becomes much harder, pay attention and get ready to stop. Know when to deploy another strategy. 

All long call strategies are dangerous. Leveraged long call strategies are dumb. Highly ITM long call strategies can be smart, in the (infrequent) right market conditions. 

Patience pays. 

Traders who ask whether you can trade for a living don’t have enough capital to do it, so, no. Those who can are already rich. And those who are rich usually have other things they want to do. 

Stop with the YouTube fantasies, get a real job, and save everything for about twenty years, like I did. It takes money to make money, and you need to make that money from somewhere. 

Don’t lie to and try to rip other people off with false promises. Stop with the $200/month Deecord scams. 

Trade fundamentally strong companies. Learn about trends and ranges. All you really need is Adam Grimes’s book, The Art and Science of Technical Analysis, and a lot of practice. 

Be someone’s best friend. Make yourself useful. Create good karma. Teach others for free. 

Go where you’re treated best. 

True wealth is what’s left when all of the money gets taken away. 

Happy Adventures,

1judegz,2025-04-08,2025-04-08 09:20:59,How I used ChatGPT to make 7.2k,"I’ve been seeing loads of people talking about using AI to trade on tiktok and few people posting about it here on reddit so figured I'd give it a try as well.

Holy shit.

I didn't put too much thought into this originally I just instructed ChatGPT to analyze price action.. mainly to spot market sentiment based on the news, support/resistance levels. Then I asked it to generate a trade plan with entry points, stop losses, and take profits all while spamming it with chart screenshots throughout the day…

I played around with a lot with prompts but the prompt used in the context of this post is:

“I need a structured trading analysis for (ETH) based on the latest 4H and 1D chart screenshots. The analysis must include: 

1, Market Sentiment & News Interpretation:

Search for relevant news regarding Ethereum and summarize its impact (bullish, bearish, or neutral). If no relevant news is found, state 'no relevant news’ 

2. Technical Analysis: • Identify the current trend based on price action, volume, and the 200 SMA. • Highlight key support and resistance levels that influence price movement. • Assess RSI for potential overbought/oversold conditions. • Identify if Ethereum is breaking above/below moving averages and what that implies. 

3. Trade Setup: Based on analysis, suggest either a long or short position, and provide the following: • Entry Price • Stop Loss (STPL) level • Take Profit (TP) Levels • DCA Strategy: • Define price levels to add to a losing position (increasing size according to risk management). DCA levels must reflect volatility index for the underlying asset. Higher volatility more spread between DCA levels. • Define price levels to add to a winning position when in profit. \* Return previous information in a well organized table chart structure. 

4. Position Sizing for a $20,000 Portfolio: • Ensure a maximum risk of 10% per trade. (This is high risk) • Use 20x leverage to determine asset quantity in contracts (not dollar value). • Maintain a structured risk-reward ratio with clear position size increments. \* position size must be in dollar amount needed to open the trade and also in the underlying assets quantity. (Example 10ETH, ""x"" amount of $) 

5. Alternative Hedge Strategy: • If the primary trade setup fails, suggest a well-structured hedge trade in the opposite direction with DCA, STPL, TP levels, and position”

(And yes I did also use ChatGPT to make the prompt lol)

It even suggested hedging with shorts at the top so by the time the peak hit I was already scaling into shorts. Ended up racking in $7,266.04 in profit from 1 ChatGPT conversation.

Insane.

I don’t know how many traders are doing this already and just gatekeeping it but this genuinely could change trading. 

Edit: Quick update. I now done this 4 times. 3 of the 4 were profitable sessions but none as profitable as the original post. I've also noticed that some other AI's work better then ChatGPT for this. I've had luck with gemini, claude, [trademind.ca](http://trademind.ca/) (the best so far) and [perplexity.com](http://perplexity.com)",1188,233,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1judegz/how_i_used_chatgpt_to_make_72k/,all,Discussion,0.89
1l8d4gw,2025-06-10,2025-06-10 19:00:00,Your Brain is Programmed to Lose Money in Trading,"**TL;DR: Academic studies prove psychological biases kill more accounts than bad strategies. Here's the science behind why your mind sabotages your trades.**

I'm about to explain why most of us will fail at trading, and it has nothing to do with our indicators or ""edge.""

# The 3 Brain Glitches That Murder Accounts

# 1. The Disposition Effect

**What it is:** You naturally hold losers too long and sell winners too fast.

**Real example:**

* AAPL drops 5% → ""It'll come back, I'll hold""
* AAPL gains 3% → ""Better take profits before it reverses""

**The brutal data:** Traders sell winners **50% more often** than losers. This single bias destroys more accounts than any strategy flaw.

**Why your brain does this:** Losses hurt 2.5x more than equivalent gains feel good (loss aversion). Your brain tricks you into avoiding the ""pain"" of realizing losses.

# 2. Confirmation Bias (The Echo Chamber)

**What happens:** You only see information that confirms your trades.

**The research:**

* Traders give **50% more weight** to confirming opinions
* Click on news that supports positions **85% of the time**
* Ignore stronger contradictory evidence

**Real behavior:** Long on Bitcoin? You'll find 10 bullish articles and ignore the bearish ones.

# 3. Overconfidence + Self-Attribution

**The cycle:**

* Win = ""I'm skilled""
* Loss = ""Bad luck/manipulation""

**Barber & Odean's study:** Overconfident traders achieve **inferior returns** and trade excessively, racking up fees.

# The Data That Should Terrify You

**Brazil:** 97% of day traders who persisted 300+ days lost money  
**Taiwan:** Only 1% of day traders profitable after fees  
**The kicker:** These failures weren't from bad strategies - they were **behavioral patterns that never changed**

# The Beginner's Luck Death Trap

Here's how most accounts die:

1. **Early random wins** create false confidence
2. **Position sizes increase** (""I've got this figured out"")
3. **Risk tolerance grows** (start gambling)
4. **Reality hits** with devastating losses
5. **Account blown** within 6 months

Sound familiar?

# The Brutal Self-Assessment

Answer honestly:

✅ Do you increase position size after wins?  
✅ Hold losers longer than winners?  
✅ Make revenge trades after losses?  
✅ Check positions obsessively?  
✅ Blame losses on ""manipulation""?

**If you answered yes to ANY of these, psychology is killing your account.**

# What Actually Works (Institutional Methods)

# Phase 1: Awareness

* **Trade journal:** Record emotional state for every trade
* **Track deviations:** Note when you break your rules
* **Loss analysis:** Review WHY you held losers too long

# Phase 2: Systematic Defense

* **Mechanical position sizing:** No discretion allowed
* **Automatic stops:** Set and forget, no moving
* **Checklists:** Remove emotion from entries/exits

# Phase 3: Professional Mindset

* **Process over profit:** Judge yourself on following rules
* **Losses are expenses:** Cost of doing business
* **Probabilities, not predictions:** Think in long-term edge

# The Professional Difference

**Retail traders:** ""This trade will make me rich""  
**Professionals:** ""This is trade #1,247 of my career""

**Retail:** Emotional roller coaster with every position  
**Professionals:** Treat trading like running a business

# The Bottom Line

**Your brain evolved for survival, not trading profits.** Every instinct that kept your ancestors alive will bankrupt your account.

The 3% who succeed don't have better strategies - they have better psychological discipline.

**Discussion:** Which bias hits you hardest? How many of you actually journal your emotional state during trades?

1j82hju,2025-03-10,2025-03-10 12:19:31,Musk Wants $58 Billion While Neglecting Tesla—Anyone Else See the Problem?,"Elon Musk has the audacity to demand a **$58 billion** pay package while treating Tesla like a side project. Since January 20, he’s been outright *neglecting* the company. Meanwhile, Tesla stock is tanking, its EV market share is shrinking, and competitors are eating its lunch.

Let’s be real—Musk isn’t running Tesla. He’s a *fake* CEO, barely even pretending to do the job while juggling **five** other companies: SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, X Corp, and xAI. Half his time is spent playing politics in the US and other European governments all while Tesla investors watch their money burn.

How much longer are people going to put up with this? If Musk doesn’t want to lead Tesla, he shouldn’t be rewarded for it. Not with a dime, and sure as hell not with $58 billion. Tesla needs real leadership, not a part-time clown who drops in whenever he feels like it.

It should send a message when Europe's second largest pension fund, APB, sells its entire $585 million stake in Tesla over Musks unjustifiable and unearned billion-dollar pay package.

The board needs to wake up and cut him loose *before* he tanks the company completely. Enough is enough. Either he **st**eps up and actually acts like a real CEO, or he needs to get the hell out and make way for someone who actually care about the company. Until then, he shouldn’t be crying to the courts about not getting his $58 billion payday. He hasn’t earned it.

1my2bw9,2025-08-23,2025-08-23 10:04:20,I wish someone told me this 9 years ago,"
Hey folks,
I’m in my early 40s now, been trading for about 9 years. Not a guru, not rich, just someone who’s seen enough wins and (plenty of) losses to have a few scars and a few insights. Trading strategies are brutal teachers, but the lessons stick – both in the markets and in life.

Here are 8 of them, structured with a little mnemonic 

Every plan fails without discipline – The setup matters less than the discipline to follow it.

Accept losses quickly – Cutting early hurts less than watching them balloon.

Time in the market beats timing the market – both for trades and for personal growth.

Money is just a tool – Don’t tie your self-worth to your P&L.

Your ego is your worst enemy – Pride makes you hold bags longer than logic.

Adapting is survival – Markets shift, life shifts; rigidity kills accounts and opportunities.

Systems over emotions – If your rules aren’t stronger than your feelings, you’ll bleed.

St happens – Black swans, flash crashes, fat fingers. Build resilience, not excuses.

1nik9y3,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 11:14:20,"5 years of trading, my best tips","I’ve been day trading full-time for about 5 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up accounts, had winning streaks, and gone through phases where I thought I finally “figured it out” only to get humbled the next week. If you’re just getting into this, I’ll save you a lot of pain by sharing the biggest lessons I wish someone drilled into me early on.

1. Risk management is everything.

This is the hill most beginners die on. It doesn’t matter how good your strategy looks, how many indicators you stack on your chart, or how many “conviction trades” you think you’ve found... if you don’t have strict risk rules, the market will clean you out. Always know your max risk per trade. For most people, that’s around 1–2% of your account balance. It sounds boring, but it’s the only thing that keeps you alive long enough to actually learn.

The temptation to “average down” or hold losers is massive when you’re new. You’ll convince yourself that a stock “has to bounce” or “can’t go any lower,” and then watch it tank another 10%. Every trader who’s lasted has their scars from ignoring stop losses. Treat capital like ammo; you only get so much of it, and wasting it on stubbornness will take you out of the game fast.

2. Don’t overtrade.

One of the biggest mistakes I see (and made myself) is thinking you need to be in a trade all the time. The reality is most of the market is just noise. The edge comes from waiting for the handful of clean setups each week that actually make sense. Some of my best months have come from taking fewer than 20 trades total.

It feels counterintuitive at first. You think, “If I’m not in a trade, I’m not making money.” But that’s backwards. By forcing trades, you’re just paying commissions, racking up losses, and burning mental energy. A huge skill in day trading is learning to sit on your hands until your setup appears. That patience is where consistency comes from.

3. Journaling changes the game.

I used to think journaling was pointless. Then I realized most of my losing trades weren’t about the strategy at all; they were about me. When you actually write down why you entered, why you exited, and what you were feeling at the time, patterns start to appear. You might notice you revenge trade after a loss, or that you take bad setups when you’re bored.

Your trading journal becomes your mirror. It forces you to face the truth instead of lying to yourself with hindsight. Over time, it’s less about “what did the chart do” and more about “why did I react this way.” That self-awareness is where growth happens, and without it, you’ll keep repeating the same mistakes.

4. Keep your setup simple.

When you’re new, you want to believe the answer is some secret indicator or complex strategy nobody else knows. So you start stacking indicators until your chart looks like Times Square. I went through that phase too. But after years of testing, I came back to the basics: clean price action, volume, and maybe one or two moving averages. That’s it.

The market isn’t hiding anything from you. Overcomplication just creates decision paralysis. The pros aren’t out here with 15 indicators... they’re reading levels, momentum, and supply/demand zones. Keep your charts clean, focus on setups you can repeat, and you’ll save yourself years of frustration.

5. Protect your mental health.

Trading will wreck you if you let it. If you’re risking rent money or grocery money, you’re trading scared, and scared traders make terrible decisions. You’ll cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and constantly feel like your back’s against the wall. That’s not trading, that’s gambling under pressure.

Detach yourself from the outcome of any single trade. This is easier said than done, but the only way to do it is by trading money you can afford to lose and keeping size small until you’re consistent. If a red day ruins your mood for 24 hours, you’re too emotionally tied to your positions. Protect your headspace first; the money follows when you’re calm.

6. Learn from screen time, not YouTube gurus.

There’s a ton of content online, but no video or course will replace actually watching the market tick by tick. You need screen time to understand how price moves, how news impacts volatility, and how momentum builds and fades. That “intuition” you see in experienced traders doesn’t come from books, it comes from thousands of hours watching patterns unfold live.

Don’t get me wrong, you can pick up useful basics from videos. But the real learning happens when you put skin in the game, track your trades, and experience the emotions firsthand. Nobody can teach you how you react to fear and greed, that’s something only screen time reveals.

7. Consistency > home runs.

The biggest misconception beginners have is thinking they need a massive trade to “make it.” They see screenshots of 10k days on Twitter and start chasing jackpots. The truth is, most accounts blow up because people swing for the fences. Survival in this game comes from small, consistent wins while keeping losses tiny.

A steady $100 a day, compounded, crushes the guy who tries to make $1,000 in one shot and wipes half his account. The math is simple, but the ego makes it hard to follow. Focus on consistency, build confidence, and scale later. Day trading is a marathon of small edges, not a lottery ticket.

Bottom line.

Day trading isn’t easy. Most people fail not because they can’t read charts, but because they underestimate how much discipline, patience, and emotional control it really takes. If you treat this like a craft instead of a get-rich-quick scheme, you’ll give yourself a real shot.

I really like this community so plan on doing more write-ups like these as a mini education series. If you guys want, my next one can be about 

A) The biggest mistakes I made in my first year of day trading (so you don’t have to)

B) What a ‘normal’ day actually looks like as a full-time day trader

C) Why 90% of traders quit in under 2 years (and how not to be one of them)

1hgi6kg,2024-12-17,2024-12-17 14:09:05,I’m a failed trader. ,"I have been buying and trading bitcoin since 2016. I had met a day trader back then who was making so much money, and he taught me how to do it with crypto. Bitcoin was my obsession. It was so exciting and everyone thought I was crazy and that bitcoin was stupid. But my conviction was strong, and now all my friend think I’m sitting on a lot of money.

I wish I had never met this guy. He introduced me to leverage trading which has made me so much money, but in the end left me with nothing. 

After years of commitment and countless hours, I know the Bitcoin chart by heart. what he didn’t teach me was risk reward, and my trading history has been a complete mess. I feel like im professional chart analyst with great skill, but suffering a gambling addiction.

Im so disgusted with myself, with how many times I’ve made life changing money, and lost it time and time again. Perhaps this is a confession.


I understand Bitcoin completely and conviction is all time highs. In my head I know I can make it all back, and this really is what fucks with my brain, because later on I’ll lose it again. So much time wasted!

The thing is… he doesn’t even know what leverage, margin, or equity are. He trades without a stop loss. He just enters a position, waits until it goes green, and then closes. That’s literally his ""strategy.""


Meanwhile, I’ve been studying trading for around 3 years. I've faced a lot if situations in the market, and I know how brutal the market can be. I know how much daily effort, discipline, and knowledge it takes. And it makes me so mad when he acts like he’s a genius and everyone else is dumb, just because he’s been lucky.


I’ve even explained a lot of things to him, but he acts like this shit is simple and I’m overcomplicating it. Yeah it's simple when someone is explaining things in short to you. For me it wasn't fking easy. I had to stay and watch dozens of hours of ICT boring content to get where I am today. Honestly, it makes me feel disgusted. I somehow feel like he’s disrespecting the work and time I’ve put in.


Maybe I feel like this also because I'm still not profitable up to this day. I am overthinking every trade and even if I have the right setup often, I end up closing the trade with a small loss just because I am doubting myself.

1nos48l,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 16:15:49,3 years of trading: The brutal lessons I wish someone told me sooner,"I’ve been trading seriously for about 3 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up small accounts, overleveraged, revenge-traded, and gone through the cycle of overconfidence → humility → back to square one. I’m not a guru, I’m not here to sell you anything. I just want to share the lessons that actually stuck with me, because I wish I had internalized these from day one.

1. Risk management isn’t optional it’s survival

Everyone says “risk management matters” but you don’t really understand it until you blow up a few accounts. The truth is, you can have a 40–50% win rate and still be profitable if your winners are bigger than your losers. But if you don’t cap your risk per trade (1–2% of account size), you’re basically playing Russian roulette. One stubborn “this has to bounce” moment can erase months of progress.

2. The market doesn’t reward effort it rewards discipline

I used to believe that the harder I studied, the more setups I should be able to find. Wrong. Most days, there’s nothing worth trading. Some of my best weeks came from taking only 3–4 trades total. Sitting on your hands feels lazy at first, but the reality is: trading more doesn’t equal earning more. It usually equals bleeding more.

3. Overcomplication is a trap

In my first year, my charts looked like a Christmas tree: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci levels, you name it. I thought the “secret” was hidden in some magical indicator combination. After testing for months, I came back to basics: clean levels, volume, and price action. Most pros I’ve observed keep it shockingly simple because clutter breeds hesitation, and hesitation costs money.

4. Journaling turned me from “random clicking” into an actual trader

I resisted journaling for the longest time. Felt tedious. But when I finally did it, patterns jumped out: I overtraded after losses, I closed winners too early when I was scared, I took dumb setups when I was bored. None of that was visible on my P&L alone. Writing down the why behind each trade gave me brutal but necessary feedback.

5. Trading will expose your psychology faster than anything else

The market is the best mirror you’ll ever have. If you’re impatient in life, you’ll overtrade. If you’re stubborn, you’ll refuse to cut losers. If you’re greedy, you’ll size up too soon. I used to think trading was about charts now I know it’s mostly about emotional control. If you don’t fix your mindset, no strategy will save you.

6. You don’t need to “quit your job” to be a trader

This one took me a while. I used to idolize the idea of being a “full-time trader” with no other income. The truth ? Having a second income stream actually helps you trade better, because you’re not desperate for every single trade to pay your bills. Desperation makes you reckless. A job or side hustle gives you breathing room, which translates into better decisions.

7. Consistency > jackpots

My biggest trap was thinking I needed one massive trade to “make it.” The truth is, trading is about grinding out small, consistent gains while keeping losses tiny. A steady +$100 a day is infinitely more powerful (and sustainable) than swinging for +$1,000 and wiping out half your account.",758,111,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nos48l/3_years_of_trading_the_brutal_lessons_i_wish/,all,Advice,0.97
1icxesu,2025-01-29,2025-01-29 11:13:20,"friend of mine traded for 10+ years, went from making $100/day to $17 mil in a year","Hey all, I am doing long-form content on trading--basically ""Trader bio's"" where I write about the best traders I have known in real life after 15 years of trading. You can check it out in my [profile link](https://churningandburning.com/category/portrait-of-a-trader-series).

Here's my TL;DR version of it in this post.

2011-2014 -- Stephen (I nickname him Clockwork, for reasons you can read about) starts at a third rate prop firm in NYC. They don't pay any salary. There's a 90% drop out rate within one year as most traders struggle during this market. Stephen likes scalping but this era marks the rapid proliferation of HFT and scalping isn't what it used to be. He's consistently able to make $100/day but it gets eaten up by profit split, fees, and living expenses. He literally sits next to me and I teach him everything I know. Only able to break through in 2014 as he shifts to OTC trading, options, and small caps.

2015-2019 -- Stephen becomes a consistent 6-figure trader. He likes to short small caps and buy large market dips during 50+ VIX events. 2017, he surpases 1 mil annual for the first time.

2020-2021 -- pandemic market with market crash and recovery, followed by crazy bubble market in SPAC's, covid stocks, SAAS/tech, pump and dumps, crypto/NFT, Stephen enters 8-figure PnL territory.

2022-2023 -- easy money over, Stephen's PnL shrinks by 80%. he has to learn how to adapt

Trading isn't easy. There's a lot of bumps along the way, even for the very best. You have to keep a student's mindset--always humble, always learning, never thinking you have it all figured out. I think Stephen really embodies that mindset. He's not out there making bold calls and claiming to have a holy grail. He just likes to make money.

Nothing glamorous, also note that still to this day, trading **is NOT** the only source of income I have, it is advised to have at least one more, for youre safety and sanity.

What I actually trade and how it performs:

ES: 40% win rate, $13,637.50 net, avg win $695.97 vs avg loss -$317.34 (\~2.2x payoff).

NQ: 52.11% win rate, $14,215 net, avg win $794.86 vs avg loss -$446.91 (\~1.8x payoff).

MES: 36.84% win rate, $917.50 net.

MNQ: 37.04% win rate, -$1,438.50 net (I cut it, noise for me).

RTY: 27.91% win rate, $1,960 net.

*Processing img j0q5ltv81vof1...*

The lesson: you don’t need a sky-high win rate if your average winner is meaningfully larger than your loser and you focus on the symbols that actually pay you.

My playbook is simple and strict. I trade a smart money concepts: wait for alignment (bias + structure), then pull the trigger only on A-setups. For index futures that means things like SMT between ES/NQ, reclaim through key levels, and clean breaks of strcuturee ofter a liquidity sweep. Early in a cycle I’ll size conservatively and let one or two quality trades build a buffer, then I protect that buffer like my paycheck. It’s boring but boring compounds.

If you’re trying to make the jump: track your real numbers, cut the instruments that drain you, and let the payoff ratio do the heavy lifting.

I’ve seen lots of similar questions in the group recently so maybe these thoughts will help if you’re considering getting started.

1. **Keep It simple:** It’s tempting to make things more complicated with tons of indicators and complex strategies, but I’ve found that simpler, clear-cut strategies tend to work better in the long run. It’s more about testing and refining than making everything overly complicated.
2. **Backtest but don’t rely too much on It:** Backtesting is important, but it’s not the whole picture. Past performance isn’t always a reliable predictor of future results. I’d recommend paper trading your algo in a real environment before going live as the market can behave a bit differently than what the backtest data shows.
3. **Risk management matters:** Even if your algo is well-built without proper risk management it can be tough to get through market swings. I always include stop-losses, position sizing, and other protective measures in my strategy.
4. **Watch out for overfitting:** A mistake I’ve made in the past is overfitting an algo to historical data. It’s important to make sure your model can adapt to live market conditions not just the past data it’s trained on. Regular monitoring and updates are key for this.
5. **Don’t forget about emotions:** Even though your algo runs automatically you can’t just “fire and forget” You still need to stay involved to monitor how things are going and make adjustments when needed. The market changes and so should your approach.
6. **Keep learning:** I’m constantly learning and trying to improve. Particularly from others in this group. Lots of good data sources and advice being shared for improving my methods—there’s always something new to discover and someone out there doing better.

**TL;DR:** Over the years, I’ve learned that simpler strategies often work best, backtesting is useful but not perfect, and risk management is crucial. Be careful not to overfit, stay involved with your algo, and always look to the advice of others for ways to improve.

What about you all? Any lessons or tips you’ve learned from your own experiences to share?

1m7v4ga,2025-07-24,2025-07-24 00:42:15,My exact daily routine as a full-time trader,"Most people only focus on what happens during the trading session.

But what I do before the market opens is what actually keeps me consistent.

Here’s the exact routine I follow every single morning:

**- 4:30 AM – Wake up (2 hours before the market opens)**

I don’t touch my phone. No emails. No charts. Just get vertical and get moving.

**- 4:35 AM – Cold shower**

Instant alertness. Forces presence. No better way to break sleep inertia.

**- 4:45 AM – 20 min walk or stretching session**

Gets the blood flowing. Movement before momentum. It clears mental fog better than any podcast.

**- 5:10 AM - 4-7-8 breathwork (10 cycles)**

Inhale for 4 seconds

Hold for 7 seconds

Exhale slowly for 8 seconds

There is 5-10min guided videos on YT

This activates the parasympathetic nervous system, reduces anxiety and sharpens focus. Especially important before a day of high-stakes decisions.

**- 6:00 AM – Black coffee + no screens**

Caffeine hits better when I’ve been awake for \~1.5 hrs. Also prevents anxiety spikes or rushed decisions.

**- 6:30 AM – Game plan review (no trades yet)**

I have a hard rule, no trading the 30 minutes before open. Instead, I use that time to:

Review my game plan (must be written the night before)

Chart out the overnight session (Asia + London highs/lows)

Update key levels or bias only if the overnight session justifies it

I always ask these 3 questions before entering a trade:

Where is price drawn to?

What is liquidity telling me?

Do I have confluence or am I forcing it?

No trade gets taken without a clear answer to all 3. No exceptions.

This routine isn’t about being perfect. It’s about showing up sharp, focused, and regulated, so that I can execute my edge without hesitation.

Happy to answer any questions or break this down further. I'm not saying you have to journal, meditate and cold plunge to become successful; this is just what worked for me and gave me clarity and routine.

1ma1ya6,2025-07-26,2025-07-26 15:25:15,Why Profitable Traders Rarely Share Their Strategies – A Hard Truth I Learned After 4 Years,"After struggling for three years in the forex market and finally becoming profitable in my fourth, I found myself asking a tough question: Why don’t experienced traders share their actual strategies?

I noticed that out of every 100 traders, maybe only two are willing to share a fully documented strategy—including any proprietary indicators, pairs they focus on, or their specific rules for execution. Even my mentor, who has over 11 years of experience, never actually gave me his strategy. Instead, he offered advice and guidelines, making me believe that following his teachings would eventually lead to consistent profitability. It helped, yes—but only to a point.

Let me break down a typical reason why profitable traders stay tight-lipped.

Take Smart Money Concepts (SMC) or even traditional support and resistance strategies. These approaches have been around for years. But when strategies become popular, they also become predictable. The same institutions and large players in the market—the so-called “smart money”—begin to exploit that predictability.

For example, a common supply and demand strategy might say:

“Buy at demand, place your stop-loss just below it, and aim for a 1:2 risk-reward ratio.”

Sounds simple. But when 99% of traders are doing exactly that, institutions will often push price slightly below the demand zone to trigger retail stop-losses—before reversing the market in the intended direction. This SL hunt clears out most traders, leaving only the 1% who waited patiently for the manipulation to play out and then entered with confirmation.

That’s exactly why only a small percentage of traders consistently make money. Most are using the same widely shared strategies, entering at the same levels, and placing stops in the same obvious places. In a game that punishes the predictable, doing what everyone else is doing just doesn’t work.

I used to think that not sharing strategies was selfish. But after learning the hard way, I understand now:

If a strategy truly works in the market and gains popularity, it becomes vulnerable to manipulation. Once it’s trending, it loses its edge.

Personally, I’m now open to sharing ideas—but only with traders who are serious about applying them uniquely, not those looking to copy-paste and hope for quick results. Also, it’s worth mentioning: many prop firms detect identical entries across accounts and may flag them as copy trading. So sharing exact entries or systems can actually hurt both parties.

There are many more reasons why profitable traders don’t openly share their strategies. ",525,199,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ma1ya6/why_profitable_traders_rarely_share_their/,all,Strategy,0.95
1li5gqn,2025-06-22,2025-06-22 22:35:07,Trading broke me,"Most people think trading is about money. Charts, setups, accounts. But the longer you’re in this game, the more you realize it’s not really about any of that. It’s about you. Your reactions. Your emotions. Your ability to sit still when every part of you wants to act. The market doesn’t just expose your weaknesses, it forces you to meet them face to face.

I used to believe I needed a better strategy,a new tool or a secret indicator, but what I really needed was to become someone who could follow the simple rules I already had. It sounds so obvious in hindsight right? cut losses, let winners run, manage risk. But when you're in the moment? That knowledge is useless unless you’ve trained yourself to act on it.

The truth is, trading feels easy until it’s real. It’s one thing to backtest or sim-trade. It’s another to watch real money vanish because you didn’t stick to your plan. That emotional spiral? The overtrading, the revenge entries, the panic exits because that’s what kills most traders. Not the market but, themselves.

Before trading I was a really confident gyu but it broke e down, showed me my flaws and obligated me to work on them to better myself and that’s what makes this journey so spiritual. Because if you stay long enough, you realize the goal isn’t to master the market. It’s to master your mind. You’re not just building a system, you’re building discipline, patience, self-awareness. The kind of traits that bleed into the rest of your life. It’s not about pressing buttons, it’s about becoming the kind of person who can press them with clarity.

I used to think trading would give me freedom and it has but not just financially. It’s forced me to grow into someone I never thought I could become. That’s why I keep showing up. That’s why I’ll never quit. Because win or lose, every session brings me closer to the version of me I’m chasing.

You stop relating to your friends. You can’t explain what you do to your family. Your routines, your goals, your mindset,  everything starts to drift away from the “normal” world. You feel like a stranger in familiar places, answering questions with half-truths just to avoid the blank stares.

But here’s the thing: that isolation carves out space.

For peace.

For discipline.

For you.

Trading isn’t for those who want validation. It’s for those who are okay walking alone.

Because the view at the top is quiet… but beautiful. If you are okay and comfortable in your own skin, you can thrive in trading and it can bring that out of you.

If you’re in that stage right now,  where it feels like no one gets you, keep going. You’re exactly where you need to be. You’re not chasing validation, you’re building freedom.

1n2y9h4,2025-08-29,2025-08-29 00:46:49,The Ugly Truth About How Long It Actually Takes To Make It In Trading,"Everyone thinks they’ll be the exception. I thought so too.

When I started, I figured one or two good years was all I needed to “crack it” and go full-time.

It took me four. And those four years looked nothing like I imagined.



Year one, I was on fire, or so I thought. Every setup I saw on YouTube went straight onto my chart. Sometimes I won big. Most times I lost bigger. I blamed my broker, my internet speed, the market… anything but me, it was never my fault, I started realizing this type of behavior in all aspects of my life.



Year two, the cracks started showing. I was no longer new, but I wasn’t good either. I’d keep switching strategies, half-heartedly journal trades, and convince myself that the next prop challenge would be “the one.” It never was.



Year three, I finally stopped trying to sprint. I stripped everything back to one market, one setup, one timeframe. I spent more time reviewing than trading. I tracked every trade, studied every miss, and realized my biggest leak wasn’t my strategy, it was me.



Year four, things got quiet. Boring. Profitable. I sized down, focused on base hits, and stopped chasing. Drawdowns became just part of the cycle instead of a crisis. My trading stopped feeling like gambling and started feeling like a business.



Some people can do this in less time. But unless you’re studying 12-14 hours a day, fully locked in, the market will humble you into taking the long route. And honestly? That’s not a bad thing. The time you “lose” learning is the time you gain in never having to blow it all again.

Then I hit $7,400.

Because I go over confient and thought I was better than the markets and it quickly humbled me,



I got overconfident. Oversized. Took revenge trades.

You can literally see the cliff on my PnL chart.



That pain forced me to face the truth.

I sized down, focused on survival, and slowly stabilized the account.



Now I’m climbing again.

Not fast, but sustainably, and that’s what matters most. 



My setups stayed the same, same timezone, I did however size down to micors and put minis aside ( I trade futures), dropped the risk lower ( I was risking 1-4% per trade, now down to 0.5-2%) and started building up a cushion again before sizing up.

1mwp11x,2025-08-21,2025-08-21 18:17:07,10 Things NOT To Do If You Want To Become a Profitable Trader,"
I’ve been trading swing options and day trading stocks for the last 8 years. I’ve blown accounts, overtraded, and made every mistake in the book. But through backtesting, journaling, and sheer repetition, I’ve figured out what separates consistent traders from the rest. Here are 10 things you must avoid if you want to get profitable:

1. Don’t chase every setup you see.
Early on, I tried to trade every pattern, every indicator, every hot stock. It spread me too thin. The breakthrough came when I focused on one model, backtested it 300+ times, and mastered it. Consistency comes from depth, not breadth.

2. Don’t ignore your risk per trade.
Sizing up randomly is the fastest way to blow an account. Pick a % you can live with, 1% or less is standard and track it. Once I started journaling risk vs reward in TradeZella, I saw my survival rate shoot up.

3. Don’t skip journaling.
Your memory is unreliable. Journaling gives you hard data. My biggest improvements came after I could see, in black and white, that revenge trades and premature exits were eating my edge alive.

4. Don’t trade without a plan.
Every trade should have levels, stop-loss, and profit targets before you enter. A plan doesn’t guarantee a win,it guarantees discipline. Forward testing plans helped me realize my execution was my real problem, not my strategy.

5. Don’t treat backtesting like busywork.
Backtesting isn’t about “curve fitting.” It’s about confidence. Once you see a setup play out 300+ times, hesitation disappears. It’s how I built conviction in both my swing setups and intraday scalps.

6. Don’t ignore market context.
A setup that prints money in trending conditions can bleed you dry in chop. I learned to separate my playbooks for different cycles, trending vs range-bound and my win rate stabilized.

7. Don’t get emotional with losses.
I’ve taken 10 losses in a row. What saved me wasn’t luck, it was keeping size small enough that my emotions didn’t hijack me. Most traders blow up not from bad strategies, but from spiraling after one loss.

8. Don’t let wins make you sloppy.
My worst days used to come after my best days. I’d get overconfident, size up recklessly, and give it all back. Journaling made me see this pattern clear as day. Now I step back after a big green streak.

9. Don’t compare your journey to others.
Everyone online looks like they’re making $10k a day. Most aren’t. My real growth came when I stopped chasing someone else’s results and doubled down on my process, one trade at a time.

10. Don’t forget this is a business.
Trading isn’t a hobby. It’s capital, risk, psychology, and systems. I treat my TradeZella journal like my business ledger. If the numbers don’t add up, the business fails.

After 8 years, here’s what I’ve learned: profitable trading isn’t about finding a holy grail. It’s about eliminating the dumb mistakes, building a repeatable system, and tracking it religiously. Backtest it. Journal it. Refine it. That’s how you turn chaos into consistency.",456,69,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1mwp11x/10_things_not_to_do_if_you_want_to_become_a/,all,Advice,0.99

Bitcoin’s been around for over a decade now but it still doesn’t seem to have found a solid role in everyday life. You can't exactly go buy gas or groceries with it in most places. Yet every time the price spikes, people start calling it “the future of money”… but that future never really comes.

I hear a lot about institutional adoption too, but if it's just big funds and whales manipulating price swings, what makes this a functional currency? If the average person is just holding the bag while institutions play the game, isn’t this just a fancier version of a pump-and-dump?

To be clear.. I actually like Bitcoin and have traded it for years. But every time I hear someone call it “digital gold,” I cringe through my teeth. Gold at least has non speculative value. It can be used in jewelry, industry it exists physically. You can hold it in your hand and it feels good to do so. People want to own it because it's a real 'thing'.

But stay in the game long enough and you realize it’s really about *you*. How you react. How you manage fear. How you sit on your hands when every instinct screams to act.

The market doesn’t just show you your strengths, it throws your weaknesses in your face. I used to think I needed a new strategy or the “right” indicator. Turns out, I just needed to become the kind of person who could follow the rules I already had,cut losses, let winners run, manage risk. Sounds simple, but in the moment? That’s where discipline gets tested.

Sim trading and backtesting feel safe. But when it’s real money and you break your rules, the spiral is brutal, overtrading, revenge entries, panic exits. The market doesn’t kill most traders but their own reactions do.

Before trading, I thought I was confident. But trading humbled me, exposed my flaws, and forced me to work on them. What’s worked for me has been a mix of things, journaling every trade in TradeZella and also running my own backtests in it, using funded accounts to scale, and surrounding myself with traders who hold me accountable in some discord groups, slowly fundinga personal acount and trading a cash account with my own rules.

Over time, I realized the goal isn’t just to master the market. It’s to master your mind. To build discipline, patience, and self-awareness that spill into the rest of your life. I know all the advice sounds cliche but it really is true, maybe if all the traders and investors are telling you the same thing, you should really listen,

I’m not saying discipline alone can replace having a proper strategy. What I am saying is this ,backtest your strategy until you trust it, find a mentor you respect if you can, and focus on just 1-2 markets, whether that’s indices, stocks, or forex. Learn what fits *you* best, whether it’s swing trading, scalping, or day trading. Don’t force yourself into a style that doesn’t feel natural. Get comfortable with your own approach and master it.

I thought trading would give me financial freedom, and it has (not Lambo or AP money like the furus you see online) but it’s also given me something bigger. Every session brings me closer to the version of myself I want to become. That’s why I keep showing up. That’s why I’ll never quit.

k70ptj,2020-12-04,2020-12-04 23:06:39,5 Tips for Trading Noobs,"1. Have a fucking trading plan/strategy and stick to it.  I can't stress enough the cliche that if you fail to plan, then you plan to fail.  You can make your trading plan as simple or as complicated as you want.  Whether you straight gamble on blind guessing or you've identified the next Black-Scholes model or something in between, have a plan and stick to it.  Over time, you will likely be tweaking your plan to perfection, or throwing it in the trash and starting over.  Either way, have a plan and even better to write it down.
2. Log your trades.  Again, you can keep it simple by just recording the date, shares price, quantity, etc. of entry and exit or you can make it more advanced by including your thought process throughout the duration of the trade, log your trades.  Record even, if you have the technology.
3. You WILL lose money.  I repeat, you will lose money sometimes (maybe all the time).  Get used to it.  Start small for a longggggg time 6-months at least, if you decide trading is long-term racket for you.  This way you don't blow your stack.  You can still be profitable being wrong more than being right.  It all depends on #1.  The market moves in a flat circle.  Opportunities present themselves regularly, learn this business.
4. If you want to try to make it in this racket either part time or full time, watch the movie Wall Street.  Yes, all the finance d-bags (myself included) have watched this dastardly masterpiece.  Yes, it has hookers and cocaine.  Yes, you will want to become a big swinging dick.  The reason I recommend this movie though, is not to imitate Gordon Gekko (and yes, every d-bag has quoted his ass before, Art of War, Greed is Good, etc. etc. so spare us the banality) or Bud Fox, but rather to listen to the wise words of Lou Mannheim.  One of his quotes rings true right now, which is, ""there is a lot of cheap money sloshing around the world"", another ""there are no shortcuts"".  You want to succeed in this racket a long time, you have to treat it with a vigor and discipline as if you were learning to become a black belt in karate.  If you just want to throw some money around for a month, no shame in that either, you can skip Lou's wise words, but watch the movie for shits nonetheless.
5. Camaraderie - learn it.  Nothing is better than a room full of traders with useful info, good ideas, or good jokes to take the edge off.  If you're a noob, don't give advice.  But you can contribute by sharing stock or other useful market news related to something you are looking at.  Ask pointed and specific questions to the elder statemen.  Misery loves company, as does glory.  Nothing better than going through it together.

What Went Wrong:



Trading all day without a structured schedule. Taking setups outside of my prime hours, thinking any move was a good move. Letting impatience push me into bad trades during low-volume hours.



What Changed:



Journaling every single trade and breaking them down by time of day. Recognizing that most of my successful trades happened during specific time windows, which for me is the first 2 hours of NY session open and Power Hour which is the last one hour of market close.



Asia session for me generally is red but London is a great session to trade due to it manipulating a high/low of Asia session then reversing to other direction high/low.



Cutting out unnecessary trades outside of those optimal hours and seeing immediate improvement.



Lesson Learned:

Time of day matters. Your strategy could be solid, but if you're applying it at the wrong times, you're just throwing away money.



I've also noticed the 30-minute window right before the NY session open is the absolute worst time to trade due to the Algo shooting up/down at open immediately to grab a quick liquidity pool before starting to move.



I’m now focusing only on my best hours and the results speak for themselves. Curious how others here figured out their optimal trading times. Was it trial and error for you too?

1j9rqkx,2025-03-12,2025-03-12 14:55:43,How I became profitable,"

I’ve been trading on and off for about 6 years. It took me 5 to become profitable not because I didn’t know what I was doing, but because I blew up every account I ever had . At least 20 times

I had to take a step back and do some deep self reflection as to what was holding me back. I had excellent technical analysis , I was trading the same few instruments, I knew how they move like the back of my hand, I was an expert in trading platforms and how to use them, I knew everything I needed about contracts and what strike prices etc everything you name it I had it all checked off

The only thing I didn’t have checked off was following my rules religiously. I would constantly over trade , revenge trade, turn winners into losers, take just one more trade ( always turned into a few more trades) full port etc. I was an emotional trader

The moment I said and ACTED ON RULES

“ I will follow my rules no matter what” “ I will respect my daily max loss no matter what” “ I will only trade within my appropriate position size no matter what” “ I will only take my A+ set ups no matter what” “ I will only take 1-3 trades no matter what” “ I will sign off after two small loses no matter what” “ I will not remove my stop loss no matter what” “ I will sign off after a good trade no matter what”

Is when I had consistently profitable weeks . Yes I had losing days , but I always recovered within a day or two and I avoided large loses Yes I didn’t make huge profits some days , but I added up wins to have winning weeks Yes I wanted to make more money, but I remembered all the times I went green to red

To any traders struggling but have a good system. The system is not what is holding you back, it’s your ability to let the system play out without making devastating mistakes.

You must re wire your mind to think in these ways and it WILL get you over that hump

 While psycholoy is important in trading, it's only relevant if you have the technicals and fundamentals down.

Hope this post can help any traders looking to improve on the mental side of trading!",388,89,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1j9rqkx/how_i_became_profitable/,all,Advice,0.98

1cdny8d,2024-04-26,2024-04-26 11:13:56,Why I quit trading.,"I tried day trading part time for just under two years. Having a mix of math and computer background and being of competitive/sporty nature I thought it could be a good fit if I could ever make it to the Algo land.

Tried paper trading for a few quarters and real trading for a few months tunning to some trading channels before reaching the conclusion it wasn't for me.

Reasons:

1- Didn't reach consistency beyond 10 days trading NYSE and NASDAQ. Even on my positive days I felt like some of my wins were lucky no matter what strategy I used.

2- Found out it's mostly (not entirely) like Poker Championship where Winner takes it all.

TraderTV Live Youtube channel owned by DTTW (one of the largest Prop Trading firms) sometimes shared their top-10 daily traders results  among the few thousand traders they have on and it was striking that the #10 on their top list was barely making over $1k which was my eventual target (for good days). Imagine only about 0.3% of traders made my daily target on any given day so I had to make it to that very thin top-tier of traders before figuring out how to stay there every day!!

Determined that was a very low chance of success for me. Too low to justify investment of my time and capital specially not knowing when, if ever, I will get to my target.

3- The level of stress even on good days was a bit too much.  Shawn Catena who is a very successful trader and the teacher on the Channel once said he wouldn't recommend the job to his kids for the level of stress it brings daily.

4- Very personal but I struggled to find meaning and satisfaction with it. I guess this could have changed if I could consistently make good money and be able to contribute to society in some other ways but when I compared myself to doctors, teachers and others who served the society directly through their jobs I felt I couldn't be satisfied long term.

Yeah, so that was my story.

=================

EDIT: Thank you folks for sharing your viewpoints and thought. I'm really glad I shared my story.

Obviously people approach trading in different stages of their life with different amount of capital, different costs of living and consequently different length of runway ahead of them. Having kids, a mortgage and other costs I had a limited timespan to test my abilities in the field. My idea was a simple 2-step plan:

1- Try traditional day-trading to identify strategies and risk management that delivers consistent profitability, and  
2- Automate those strategies and technics using algos.

It is clear to me now this was too ambitious of a target for the amount of capital and time available to me (let alone doing it part time) because I could never even achieve step 1 in two years. It did not help that I found out what tiny percentage of full time traders ever make the amount of money I was after. Maybe I should've checked that before the start. As a principle I'd like to enter competitions/situations/fields that I have a fair to good chance for success and I received data that was not the case. (porter 5 principle)

I faced the question of how much more capital and time was needed to reach my goals and the problem was there was no definitive answer whatsoever. I could've reached consistent profitability in 3 more years, 7 more years or 17 more years and I knew I didn't have the luxury of unlimited time and money. As a pragmatic person responsible for the finances of my family, I had to set milestones for myself with consequences. Since I couldn't deliver on the final milestone, the consequence was to pivot. (fail fast principle).

I'm confident I made the right decision for me and my family as I have been able to switch back to area of my expertise, exceed my financial targets, with a lot less stress and much bigger sense of fulfillment.

Thanks again for sharing your thoughts and wish you all well in your trading journey.

==================

TL;DR: Could not find consistency after two years of trying (part time). Didn't make any money and found out a very very tiny % of day traders make good money and it wasn't clear at all how long, if ever, could take to get there. Stress was too much.

1n0hl6z,2025-08-26,2025-08-26 05:55:09,My 2 cents on Trading - Grew $200k to $2 million in 5 years,"I think the sweet spot is in the combination of investing, swing trading and day trading. When done in harmony, they complement each other effectively. The primary goal is to grow your wealth. Whether what you are doing falls under investing or daytrading really shouldn't matter.

For example, one extremely effective strategy is core position trading. Find a stock that you are fully convicted in. Something you would have held long term anyway. Then trade around it by selling calls and puts. There is almost no way you could lose money with this approach other than the underlying itself is tanking. But if the underlying has a high likelihood of eventually going back up, in the long term, you will not be in loss. Finding such an underlying is not impossible based on the observation that US stock market goes up in the long run. So you can either choose some company form the top 1% or just pick something like QQQ or SPY. The only way you to not make money would be if SPY, which means the market itself, goes downward consistently over time.

I have been a living proof of this. I grew my wealth from $200k to $2 million in a matter of 5 years. Even without some luck factors, I did really well from trading. This year I wasn't particularly lucky, an average year, I have made $120k so far just from trading, not counting long term growth, which is another $150-200k. My monthly semi-passive income is now $10k.

So yeah, it is definitely possible to be a successful trader, if your expectations are reasonable. I consider 15-20% annual profit as a reasonable target for trading. But I have seen most traders target a lot higher. They end up taking lot more aggressive trades and losing money in the long run. For me, I was profitable from day one.

1hmsoym,2024-12-26,2024-12-26 12:04:51,Swing trades are the way,"I found the most success with swing trades. I started with mid cap shares, with basic information, mostly I’d just buy on Friday and usually sell on Wednesday. It was very easy and I was often consistently making money each week

Then I purchased a trading course where I actually learned how to trade, and purchased good trading software. This year, I started with the ABC strategy.. I make really good money. I run a scan for patterns in the market and pick a stock and set a buy and sell.. sometimes, I’m in and out on the same day, mostly it takes a few days. I only watch those stocks when I see them heat up, the rest of the time I’m out living my life. I have multiple swing positions, usually I’ll close at least 2 a week. Just now I closed a position in AMPX, I bought in last week 2.02 and sold at 2.315. That trade paid for the Christmas presents I purchased for my loved ones.

For me, this is very easy now. It does take an emotional toll, trading is stressful, but swing trading helps me minimize that stress and allows me to make good decisions without the noise. 

I assert that since I have adopted my style within the above strategy, this year.. my trades have been 100% successful. Sometimes I’ve been tied up longer than I wanted, some of my wins have been greater than others. But, i have taken a profit on every single trade. I will back up this assertion at a later date, I’ll publish a spreadsheet. 

Personally I think swing trading is the best way to be profitable. For the new traders out there, I would recommend you consider this strategy. It’s safe. Don’t trade crypto, or futures. Swing trade with stocks. Start with mid cap shares that show a consistent movement and buy the dip, sell as it tops. Simple easy money. Grow your portfolio over time. Don’t be greedy.

I don’t want to sound like I’m bragging, i don’t want naysayers to challenge me. But I am in awe of the money I make, it doesn’t feel real. Like I spent $180.00 on cologne, something I would never have purchased before.. but $180.00 just doesn’t feel like a lot of money anymore.

1n8ukqz,2025-09-04,2025-09-04 23:24:01,Lessons From a 7-Figure Trader (28R in August),"My mentor just wrapped up one of his best months this quarter, 28R net in August. He’s a 7-figure trader and what stood out to me wasn’t the P&L, but the principles he keeps hammering into me. I wanted to share them here because I know some of you are grinding through the same lessons.

https://preview.redd.it/7oxducf5l9nf1.jpg?width=990&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58d5c36d6af8abefb989ce4182e4aac18a035ef4

 

**1.Discipline beats “activity.”**

He didn’t take every setup under the sun. Only A+ plays. No random entries. The month was built on conviction trades he’s backtested a thousand times. Mostly focused on **$TSLA, $HOOD, $SNOW**

**2. Risk management creates freedom.**

A profit factor of 2.37 and a win/loss ratio near 3:1 didn’t happen by chance. He sized in only when risk was capped and stayed consistent with losers. His drawdowns were controlled, which kept him in the game. Only one small red week gives him confidence even more while he is already very green for the month.

**3. Know what works, know what doesn’t.**

Directional auctions and failed breakdowns worked beautifully. Range setups? Liquidity sweeps destroyed them. He doubled down on strengths and is already refining the weak spots.

**4. Leave money on the table? Good problem.**

His biggest critique of himself was not letting winners run. That says it all. Losing days were managed. Big days left untapped gains. It’s a reminder: you’re better off leaving money on the table than bleeding it back.

**5. Don’t force sync.**

If the market feels “off,” step away. Taking breaks is part of being consistent. Trading through chop only burns capital and confidence. (This is a part I struggled with heavily myself, trading feels like a drug sometimes, even though I say I won't trade, 5min later you find me in a trade.)

September game plan (the part I’m adopting too):

Review losing days deeply. Was it the setup, execution, or just market noise?

Only trade data-backed edges. Nothing else.

Focus on conviction: if the thesis isn’t clear, don’t touch it.

Accept missed trades. Missing is cheap, forcing is expensive.

I think the biggest lesson for me is that trading is not about catching every move, it’s about catching your move. The setups you know, the plays you trust, the risks you’re willing to take.

Check my previous post for more details!

# Idea

Internal Bar Strength (IBS) is a technical analysis indicator used to gauge the relative position of a closing price within the daily trading range. Traders use it to determine momentum. IBS is particularly effective when used as mean-reversion strategy.

The Internal Bar Strength is calculated using the formula:

**IBS = (Close - Low ) / (High - Low)**

* *Low IBS values (< 0.2):* May indicate oversold conditions, suggesting a possible upward move.
* *High IBS values (> 0.8):* May signal overbought conditions, indicating a potential downward move.

# Strategy

* **Instrument**: US100 (NQ)
* **TF**: 1D (*The strategy does not work on time frames below)*
* **Initial Capital:** 10k$
* **Risked Money**: 500$
* **Data Period**: 2009.01.01 - 2024.12.04

*The strategy buys only if there are no open trades. That is, there can be only 1 trade at a time.*  
*The strategy does not have a shortsell trades as instrument is often in the uptrend.*

***Inputs:***

1. Low\_IBS - **0.1**/0.2/0.3
2. High\_IBS - 0.75/0.8/**0.9**

**Buy Rule:** IBS < Low\_IBS  
**Close Rule**: IBS > High\_IBS. Exit after 30 days.

Since it is a [Mean Reversion](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/mean-reversion) strategy:  
**I do not recommend using the Stop Loss** as it increases the drawdown and reduces the profit.  
**I don’t recommend using Take Profit** as it reduces profits.

# Conclusions

1. Works any time of year and doesn't require a filter.
2. Uses a unique indicator, which is usually not available in trading platforms.
3. There are problems with the exit rule. It's often too late, worth considering.
4. Compared to other Mean Reversions it has a fairly low winrate, low profit factor.
5. Behaves too differently on different instruments and on different parameters.
6. Even alone without a portfolio of strategies with the right risk management can beat the returns of the index itself!

1l2j1nm,2025-06-03,2025-06-03 14:09:40,"4 Years Alone, No Support, No Results… Until I Shut Up and Worked.","Hi everyone, today is a big day for me. I’ve been in the markets for almost 4 years now (way before the “gurus” came in and ruined the image of trading by making it seem like easy money), and I’d like to share my journey with you. I hope it can inspire some of you.

When I first started, I was super excited. It felt like I had found something special, something no one around me really understood or even cared about. None of my friends were talking about it, they weren’t even interested. For 4 years, I was completely alone, reading, learning, and developing a real passion for macroeconomics. That’s where I discovered my potential. I loved it, and I was able to anticipate market movements pretty naturally.

At 18, I decided to go all in. Not just backtesting anymore, but actually trading with real money. I started with a $50 live account, and within a few months, I turned it into $300. I didn’t use stop losses (I was overconfident), but I didn’t overleverage either. I always calculated my risk-to-reward before entering a trade. I wasn’t gambling I knew what I was doing. But I didn’t know how to manage it properly.

For nearly 3 years, every time I hit a 1:1 RR, I closed the trade… only to watch price go exactly where I had predicted. I knew something was missing. And then I learned one of the most important lessons: the market doesn’t reward you for predicting it, it rewards you for managing it and actually making money off it.

And the truth is, I was a top student. I was enrolled in a pretty demanding academic program, but little by little, I started skipping classes. I’d spend all my time trading in the library before class, during, and after. I failed all my exams and stopped going to school entirely. That’s when the real problems started. To my parents, I was a failure. I shut myself off from everyone… but deep down, I still had this dream burning inside me.

Throughout this entire journey, I knew exactly what I was doing. But I never made money off my trades. Why? Because I hesitated too much. I kept thinking: “This is too easy it can’t be real. Easy money doesn’t exist.” I was scared I’d lose everything, like in the stories of all the great traders who went broke. So I just sat in front of my screen, watching the market do exactly what I predicted… but without taking the trade, frozen by doubt.

The moment I stopped talking about it with my parents that’s when things changed. I made them believe I was going to school, but in reality, I was trading. And for the first time, I started making money. That’s when I realized: my environment was pulling me down and making me doubt myself. As soon as I stopped looking for validation, everything shifted.

I read tons of books on trading and psychology and worked hard to build mental discipline. And that’s how I became a profitable trader. People have always said I’m a big dreamer but you know what? Most people don’t even know how to dream. I turned my dream into a goal, and that goal into reality.

Today, I’m funded on a 10k account and a 100k account for over a year now, and I just finished the evaluation for a 200k account. I’ve taken 3 evaluations so far, and I passed all 3. My secret?

1nkhybe,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 15:33:31,Trading Is the Hardest Thing I’ve Ever Done,"

I grew up in a small town in Mexico. My parents worked jobs that barely kept food on the table, and from a young age, I knew if I wanted something more, I’d have to figure it out myself. At 19, I crossed the border with nothing but a backpack, a few clothes, and a dream of building a better life.

I washed dishes, stocked shelves overnight, and sent money home when I could. I shared a one-bedroom apartment with three other guys just to cover rent. Some weeks I worked 70–80 hours, only to end up with barely enough left to buy groceries. It was exhausting, but I kept telling myself, “This is temporary, justy keep moving.”

Then I discovered amazon FBA, failed. Dropshipping, failed and then finallly trading. I thought it would be my escape, finally a way to use my brain instead of my back. I opened a brokerage account, put in a few thousand dollars, and thought I could flip it fast. I lost it all in less than two months. The frustration was unreal. I felt like I was running in circles: breaking my body at work, then burning through savings at night chasing green candles.

But I didn’t quit. I slowed down and started studying. I found futures and realized this was a real profession, not a shortcut. I backtested for months. I journaled every mistake. I cut my size to the smallest possible and focused on surviving first. Slowly, things started to click. My first payout from a prop firm wasn’t big, just $1,000 but it felt like the world to me. It proved I wasn’t crazy for believing I could do this.

Here’s what trading taught me: it’s not a hustle, it’s a mirror. It shows you every weakness and impatience, ego, greed and forces you to deal with them. That’s why it’s harder than any job I’ve ever worked. Because it doesn’t just demand skill; it demands you to change who you are.

Today, I’m not rich, but I’m consistent. I can finally say I trade with confidence. I still send money home. I still live simply. But I built this life from nothing, and that’s something no one can take from me.

And if there’s one thing I know for sure:

1lt72ps,2025-07-06,2025-07-06 13:38:20,"What losing $67,000 taught me about risk.","December 2024 was the worst month of my trading career. Ironically, it came right after my best months ever. I was on top of the world, trading 20 funded accounts at the same time, pulling profits consistently for weeks. It felt like I couldn’t lose and that overconfidence was the start of my downfall.



The mistake? I broke my own rules. My risk plan was simple: take 75% off at 2R, leave a runner for 4R or a clear draw on liquidity. But I got greedy. I skipped the 2R partials and tried to hold the full position for big home-run trades, thinking I could push every move to 3-6R. What I didn’t account for was the holiday chop. Markets slowed, reversals were brutal, and most trades barely made 1R before snapping back. One by one, I watched profits evaporate.



In the end, I lost all the gains I’d worked so hard for and the accounts themselves. $67,000 gone. The worst part wasn’t the money, but realizing I’d let discipline slip right when it mattered most. What I learned is simple but painful: the market punishes arrogance. Sticking to your plan matters more than any single trade, and risking consistency for ego is never worth it.

1mnz9d2,2025-08-12,2025-08-12 00:33:25,7 things I stopped doing that finally made me profitable,"It took me years to figure this out,not because the markets are hiding secrets, but because my bad habits kept getting in the way. The truth is, my strategy was good enough a long time ago. What wasn’t good enough was how I was approaching it. Here are the 7 things I cut out that changed everything.



**1. Trading all day, every day**

I used to think more screen time meant more money. It was the opposite. The longer I sat there, the more likely I was to take impulsive trades. Now I have a fixed time window. If I don’t get my setup in that window, I’m done. Fewer hours. Better trades. More mental energy.



**2. Ignoring journaling**

For years, I kept telling myself “I’ll remember this trade”  and then I’d forget why I took it two days later. Now I journal every single trade. I write down the setup, entry, stop, target, market context, and post-trade thoughts. I track all of this in my journaling software, which makes it easy to see patterns and spot the mistakes I keep repeating. At the end of each week, I review my journal like game tape. It’s uncomfortable at times, but it’s where the growth happens. I’ll drop my template pics in the comments so you can copy them.



**3. Backtesting only when I felt like it**

When I backtested weekly, my execution sharpened and my confidence went up. When I skipped it, doubt crept in and bad habits returned. Now I run through at least 20-30 examples of my setups every weekend. I have a backtesting software I use that makes this part faster since I can filter my trades by setup and study them in bulk. It’s like sharpening your tools before the next work week, a non-**negotiable.**



**4. Taking “and then some” trades**

This was killing me slowly. I’d hit my daily target and then think, “One more can’t hurt.” It hurt. The extra trade was usually lower quality and taken out of boredom, not conviction. Now, when my plan is done, I’m done. No exceptions.



**5. Counter-trend gambling**

I convinced myself I could “catch the turn” more often than not. The truth? I was giving back profits trying to be a hero. Now I let the trend be the trend until my setup tells me otherwise. The money is in trading what is, not what I think should be.



**6. Trading without a clear bias**

There’s a difference between “no bias” and “confused bias.” I’d flip flop all day because I didn’t have a clear game plan. Now I build my bias pre-market and only shift it if the market gives me undeniable evidence to do so. It keeps me from reacting to every wiggle.



**7. Ignoring the drawdown rules I knew I should follow**

When I hit drawdown, I used to size up to “make it back faster.” That’s the exact mindset that blows accounts. Now I cut size down to 1-2 micros until I’m back in rhythm. It’s slower, but it rebuilds both my account and my confidence at the same time.



Cutting these habits didn’t just make me profitable, it made trading boring in the best way possible. No more rollercoaster. No more adrenaline chasing. Just execution, review, and slow growth that compounds over time.



If you’re struggling, you probably don’t need a new strategy. You need to stop doing the things that are sabotaging the one you already have. Journaling, backtesting, and tracking your progress with proper tools (not just trading view) has been the biggest difference maker for me.

1m8fzup,2025-07-24,2025-07-24 16:53:19,Trading will humble you in ways you’re not ready for.,"I don’t care how smart you think you are.

The market will break your ego, your illusions of control, and your sense of certainty.

You’ll take a perfect setup, execute perfectly, and still lose.

You’ll have a green week and think you’re invincible, only to get smacked in the face the next day.

You’ll watch a trade rip in your direction right after you exit because you couldn’t handle the drawdown.

You’ll feel alone because nobody around you truly understands this game.

You’ll question yourself, your process, and your future more times than you want to admit.

But if you let it, trading will also build you:

- It will force you to take radical responsibility for your decisions.
- It will teach you discipline when it’s boring and patience when it’s painful.
- It will show you how to manage your emotions under pressure.
- It will teach you that uncertainty is normal, and the goal isn’t to predict but to manage risk.

Most people don’t fail at trading because they can’t read a chart.

They fail because they can’t manage themselves.

They fail because they keep chasing dopamine instead of discipline.

They fail because they let one bad day turn into blowing up their account.

If you’re in the trenches right now, feeling stuck, you’re not alone.

Trading is simple, but it’s not easy.

Your job is to keep showing up, keep refining your edge, and keep working on yourself.

Because the moment you think you’ve “figured it out,” the market will humble you again.

I'm not going to talk about the journey but it has been anything but linear)

Just want to share some things that I believe after all this time, my closest friends are mostly all traders 

  
1. Even when you get to a point of ""profitability"" it doesn't mean that tilts magically disappear - if you get triggered by something outside of your trading like wifi stops working, body feeling funky, getting a negative text message - anything can affect your trading and trigger you into a tilt. 

2. The more I trade, the simpler I make my system. I don't trade with indicators anymore as they are simply just lagging indicators making calculations based on past price. (everyone I know that are successful trades purely price action, S/D and sometimes VWAP) 

3. Bad trading is often because of a non clarified system - (I have my on ONE PAGE - I call it the ""one page trading plan"") - Because you can't keep to many things in your head at the same time, as too many conscious thoughts at the same time will create emotions 

4. Successful trading often comes after a hard choice. I made this choice when I lost everything I ever had + had to take out a loan to survive. ""will I quit, or am I going to do EVERYTHING that I can to make it?"" 

5. The number 1 thing to focus on is to keep yourself feeling like a professional trader. ""What can I do today to feel like a professional trader"" - the belief is number 1. 

6. Trading is easier with less trades. It feels like you need to take more trades to make more money, but that will come at the cost of emotional damage. And emotional damage creates bad trading.

7. The number one skill I've found from trading is emotional regulation. It's helping my trading so much, and at the same time makes everything else in life much easier.

1ii4i6o,2025-02-05,2025-02-05 02:10:41,Risk management lessons I wish I’d learned earlier,"Fellow traders,

Sharing another simple truths post as I continue documenting my trading journey—the real, unfiltered version. No hype, no shortcuts, and definitely no bragging. Just lessons learned the hard way that anyone starting out might find useful.

Early on in my trading journey, I had a strategy that worked… until it didn’t. One missed order wiped out weeks of progress. That was my wake-up call, even the best strategy means nothing without solid risk management. It’s like driving without brakes—sooner or later, you crash.

These days, I stick to strict risk parameters—stop-losses, position sizing, and clear drawdown limits. It’s not the flashiest part of trading, but looking back, it’s the only way to stay in the game long enough to be profitable.

Here are a few lessons I wish I had learned earlier:

1. **Plan your trade then trade your plan.** A solid strategy only works if you stick to it—emotional decisions in the moment can undo everything.
2. **Position sizing matters.** Never risk more than you’re truly willing to lose on any single trade.
3. **Stop-losses are non-negotiable.** They’re your safety net—use them.
4. **Losses are part of the game.** Accept them, learn from them, and move forward.
5. **Have a drawdown limit.** Know when to step away before you start chasing losses.

**TL;DR:** A great strategy without risk management won’t get you far. Use stop-losses, position sizing, and drawdown limits to protect your downside. Learn from your mistakes and always stick to your plan.

Would be great to hear your go-to risk management rules—let’s share ideas and improve together.",292,35,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ii4i6o/risk_management_lessons_i_wish_id_learned_earlier/,all,Strategy,1.0
1gzrlg2,2024-11-25,2024-11-25 14:34:29,"If you’re still unprofitable, read this.","Hey everyone, I get a lot of messages on this topic so let’s jump into it. Hopefully you could pick up something. 

1. Charting, Technical analysis, is not the whole game. Any bloke can learn TA and draw couple of lines. This isn’t art class. This is about making money. A lot of time I hear traders say: “but it didn’t respect my trend line”. You think the market cares about the trend line you drew on your screen? All this to say, if your only way of trading is being a great chart artist, you’re in for a long painful ride. Being a great chartist is just a piece of the pie. 

2. Some Products are more BUY biased than others. Some products are more SELL biased than others. This is due to the nature and fundamentals of the product and the psychology of whom is buying and selling these products. 

Let’s take EUR/USD for example. You have a MUCH higher probability of making money shorting it high than trying to buy it low. The reason for this is the nature of the fundamental of the product. 

The Euro has low interest rates. The US dollar has much higher interest rates than the euro. What this means is, for every chance the central banks get to sell their Euro high in exchange for Dollar, they’re most keen to take that trade. As owning Dollar pays more than owning Euro. 

So stop fighting logic of economics and trying to long a majority shorted product. 

Change your approach towards tailoring your charting towards setting up high value shorts only instead of always trying to long and buy. 

So start learning the fundamentals of the product you’re trading. If you don’t understand the economics of the product you’re trading… you should not be trading it. 

I’ve seen so many traders say “I lost s money on GBPCHF”. Meanwhile they know nothing about what drives the Swiss franc and don’t understand its supply demand reasoning pinned against the pound. 

Learn your Dam products… and establish a directional bias. It’s not all just charting.

3. You’re under capitalized and that’s killing you. If you have no money, let’s face it; the odds are against you making a decent living in this space.

On a 10k account, You’ll drive yourself in a well of despair trying to turn profitable, you have a low margin for error due to the amounts of profit you wish to make. 4-5$ a trade really isn’t anything….you’ll psychologically try to take more trades than you’re used to, to make EXTRA money. You’ll get frustrated and over leverage. I don’t care who you are. 10k isn’t much in this day and age. You need a decent size account. Typically I’ll say 30k and up to make some sort of living that makes some sense.

PROP FIRMS aren’t much better, as they are designed for you to fail and keep paying them to keep taking their challenge. That’s the business. Trading is hard enough as it is, now you want to put a 4% daily drawdown limit? And at every chance you get close me out? You limit the power of natural trading. 

4. You’re up on a trade, but you’re deluded into thinking it needs to hit your magical TP LEVEL or else you won’t get you R:R you were looking for.

You leave money on the table sitting there. I laugh at traders who are up on a trade and wait to take profit until it hits their level of “analysis”

The game isn’t about a level being hit to fuel your ego. It’s about getting paid. Stop leaving money on the table.

I see so many traders wait and then the trade reverses and goes to their stop loss level. 

What is this stupidity. Take money when you’re up. Keep finding great entries and bank that profit. This small adjustment alone can be the difference you need. 

5. If you’ve followed everything above and are still unprofitable, it’s time you get a Mentor and maybe switch from swing trading to scalping or scalp to swing trading to scalp. Sometimes you need to just switch it up. Everything you learnt isn’t for nothing. It’s still experience and knowledge. A mentor can help you break a plateau and tell you things you’ve been overlooking. Kind of like this post. 
—————————

I’ll end it here. There’s so many things to consider trading. It takes time. It takes years typically. If you’re not profitable yet, keep grinding, keep getting better. Change the conditions and put the game in your favour.

# Idea

US-100 often experience phases of excessive optimism (overbought) and pessimism (oversold), where prices deviate significantly from their mean value. The mean reversion strategy aims to capitalize on these deviations by entering trades when prices are likely to revert to their average.

The [CCI ](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/commodity-channel-index)indicator itself shows how much the price deviates from the mean. This is what you need for a Mean Reversion strategy!

# Strategy

* **Instrument**: US100 (NQ)
* **TF**: 1D (*The strategy does not work on time frames below)*
* **Initial Capital:** 10k$
* **Risked Money**: 500$
* **Data Period**: 2012.01.19 - 2024.11.28

*The strategy buys only if there are no open trades. That is, there can be only 1 trade at a time.*  
*The strategy does not have a shortsell trades as instrument is often in the uptrend.*

***Inputs:***

1. Period: **4**/7/14
2. LowTh: **-100**/-75/-50
3. HighTh: **50**/75/100

**Buy Rules:** CCI(Period) < LowTh  
**Close Rule**: CCI(Period) > HighTh

Since it is a [Mean Reversion](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/mean-reversion) strategy:  
**I do not recommend using the Stop Loss** as it increases the drawdown and reduces the profit.  
**I don’t recommend using Take Profit** as it reduces profits.

# Results

# Conclusions

1. CCI is the best indicator for Mean Reversion strategies
2. The strategy works well on all MR instruments
3. 71% winrate, which is pretty normal for Mean Reversion
4. You need to select different parameters for each instrument. Experiment with other indicators in combination for enters and exits

You have to build it yourself. You have to put in the time, make the mistakes, and actually figure out why those mistakes happen.

The only way to grow is by being on the charts. Not just copying someone else’s signals, but watching the market, experimenting, adjusting, and learning. Every failed trade is a lesson — you find what went wrong, fix it, and keep going.

This repetition - watch, fail, adjust, repeat - eventually rewires how you see the market. Patterns start jumping out at you, your instincts sharpen. Not because a mentor told you so, but because you’ve trained your own eyes over and over again.

But here’s the catch: it takes time. Sometimes months, even years. And that’s perfectly normal.

Forget the flashy “100% win rate” stuff and quick-money promises. Real progress comes from the quiet grind: reviewing, testing, and improving every single day. That’s where your edge is built.

**This document is for anyone curious about the reasoning behind our process and thinking, or for those seeking deep trading knowledge.**

***Pause and read when something piques your interest. Judge by citation.***

**1. Random Walk & Market Efficiency**

**Eugene Fama - THE BEHAVIOR OF STOCK-MARKET PRICES**

**Key Part:**

“By contrast the theory of random walks says that the future path of the price level of a security is no more predictable than the path of a series of cumulated random numbers. In statistical terms the theory says that successive price changes are independent, identically distributed random variables. Most simply this implies that the series of price changes has no memory, that is, the past cannot be used to predict the future in any meaningful way”

**Note:**  
We are not suggesting the market is 100% efficient/random. We referenced this to show how randomness in a market isn’t good for your bottom line. The more efficient/random a market is the harder it is to trade profitably

**Eugene Fama - Random Walks in Stock Market Prices.**

**Key Takeaway:**

if the random-walk theory is an accurate description of reality, then the various “technical” or “chartist” procedures for predicting stock prices are completely without value.

 

**Burton Malkiel - A Random Walk Down Wall Street**

**Key Lines:**

“A random walk is one in which future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past history. When the term is applied to the stock market, it means that short-run changes in stock prices are unpredictable”

“Mathematicians call a sequence of numbers produced by a random process (such as those on our simulated stock chart) a random walk. The next move on the chart is completely unpredictable on the basis of what has happened before.” – **Referencing Random Candlestick Charts**

**The core lesson of the random‐walk theory is that you cannot predict future market price movements by studying historical data if the market is 100% random.**

 

**2. Alpha/Market Edge Decay & Why no profitable trader would sell or give away their strategy for free.\[1\]**

**Julien Penasse - Understanding Alpha Decay**

 

**Highlights that alpha (edge over market) tends to diminish. alpha decay is generally a nonstationary phenomenon/inconsistent. Julien leverages studied anomalies for credibility.**

**Key Parts:** “Because alpha decay is generally a non-stationary phenomenon, asset pricing tests that impose stationarity may lead to biased inference. I illustrate the importance of alpha decay using the most commonly-studied anomalies in the asset pricing literature”

“Alpha decay refers to the reduction in abnormal expected returns (relative to an asset pricing model) in response to an anomaly becoming widely known among market participants” **\[1\]**

 

**This is popular, modern and potent evidence that alpha decay and edge decay is real.**

**Does Academic Research Destroy Stock Return Predictability? - Journal of Finance, R. David McLean**

**Published in 2016**

**Key takeaway:**

“Portfolio returns are 26% lower out-of-sample and 58% lower post-publication. The out-of-sample decline is an upper bound estimate of data mining effects. We estimate a 32% (58% - 26%) lower return from publication-informed trading.”

 

**On the Effect of Alpha Decay and Transaction Costs on the Multi-period Optimal Trading Strategy** by Chutian Ma and Paul Smith (2025):

The approach shown on this paper captures the essence of alpha decay by allowing the strength of signals to wane as they age, reflecting reality where the effectiveness of trading signals decrease over time. Re-enforcing the idea of edge / alpha decay.

Present in the ABSTRACT: **“To simulate alpha decay, we consider a case where not only the present value of a signal, but also past values, have predictive power”**

**4. Mean Reversion vs. Trending Characterization**

**Intraday mean-reversion after open shocks: Grant, Wolf, and Yu (2005) document strong reversal effects in US equity index futures**

**Key Lines:**

This paper gives a long-term assessment of intraday price reversals in the US stock index futures market following large price changes at the market open. We find highly significant intraday price reversals over a 15-year period (November 1987-September 2002) as well as significant intraday reversals in our yearly and day-of-the-week investigations. Moreover, the strength of the intraday overreaction phenomenon seems more pronounced following large positive price changes at the market open.

 That being said, the question of whether a trader can consistently profit from this information remains open as the significance of intraday price reversals is sharply reduced when gross trading results are adjusted by a bid-ask proxy for transactions costs.

**5. Backtesting**

**Bailey, López de Prado & Zhu - Pseudo‐Mathematics and Financial Charlatanism**

**Key Lines**

We prove that high simulated performance is easily achievable after backtesting a relatively small number of alternative strategy configurations, a practice we denote ‘backtest overfitting

The higher the number of configurations tried, the greater is the probability that the backtest is overfit... Under memory effects, backtest overfitting leads to negative expected returns out-of-sample, rather than zero performance.

**6. Order Flow, Microstructure and how markets work**

**Albert S. Kyle - Continuous Auctions and Insider Trading**

**Key Lines for us:**

**Albert S. Kyle** “Perhaps the most interesting properties concern the liquidity characteristics of the market in a continuous auction equilibrium. ""Market liquidity"" is a slippery and elusive concept, in part because it encompasses a number of transactional properties of markets. These include ""tightness"" (the cost of turning around a position over a short period of time), ""depth"" (the size of an order flow innovation required to change prices a given amount), and ""resiliency"" (the speed with which prices recover from a random, uninformative shock). Black \[2\] describes intuitively a liquid market in the following manner: ""The market for a stock is liquid if the following conditions hold: (1) There are always bid and asked prices for the investor who wants to buy or sell small amounts of stock immediately. (2) The difference between the bid and asked prices (the spread) is always small”

Kyle breaks down what Market liquidity is and What makes a market liquid showing that imbalances between buyers and sellers i.e. imbalance in liquidity is the reason why price moves. To us this is obvious but many traders don’t consider it.

**Present in the ABSTRACT:**

""Belief in one's ability to exert control over the environment and to produce desired results is essential for an individual's wellbeing. It has repeatedly been argued that perception of control is not only desirable, but is also probably a psychological and biological necessity. In this article, we review the literature supporting this claim and present evidence of a biological basis for the need for control and for choice-that is, the means by which we exercise control over the environment. Converging evidence from animal research, clinical studies and neuroimaging suggests that the need for control is a biological imperative for survival, and a corticostriatal network is implicated as the neural substrate of this adaptive behavior.""

Both involve paying financing costs if you hold positions overnight (swap fees)

# Definitions written by Ali (SentientAnalyzer)

**1.Constraints**

What limits you - time, capital, lifestyle. These set the boundaries for what you can actually trade. Your system must respect them.

**2. Market Type**

Behaviour of a market: mean reverting, trending, or random/alternating.

**3. Valid Trading Window**

The hours when you’re allowed to trade. Based on where volume and volatility are, not your convenience.

**4. Risk (R)**

The set amount of capital you’re willing to lose per trade. Fixed, consistent. Example: 1R = 3%.

**5. RRR**

Risk-to-reward ratio (e.g. 1:3 = risk $100 to make $300).

**6. Order-Flow Mechanics**

Price moves because buyers and sellers are imbalanced. That’s it. It explains rejections and moves - it’s not an edge, it’s just reality.

**7. 3-Wick Setup**

Three wicks rejecting a level - signals price has repeated selling activity and won’t break through. Must be rule-based, not subjective.

**8. Tick**

The smallest price increment on an instrument.

**9. Execution**

Cost Spreads, commissions, and slippage affecting net performance. Ignore it and your edge vanishes.

**10. Backtest**

Testing your rules on past data. Done honestly - no scrolling, no cherrypicking, no hindsight. Bar Replay below in

**11. Overfitting**

When your strategy works only on the past because you’ve shaped it to work on past historical data instead of applying and idea to historical data. Looks good in testing, fails live.

**12. Stress Test**

Deliberately run your system in bad conditions. These are notable periods of intraday chop, low volume on trend trading strategies and periods of relentless trends on mean reversion/reversal strategies. If it collapses, it’s weak.

Example: Someone could be running a mean reversion day trading system on YM and he could stress test August 8th to September 13th 2024 as an example, where, here Dow Jones exhibited strong trending behaviour which is against the system’s nature.

**13. Bar Replay Play**

charts forward candle by candle to mimic real-time. Helps you test if you’d actually take your setups live. E.g., TradingView Bar Replay

**14. Scaling In**

Adding size after entry. Must be planned and tested - not just done because “it looks good”.

**15. Hedge**

Open a position benefiting from movements in the opposite direction. Useful at times, but messy if you don’t have clear rules.

**16. Breakeven/Partials**

Closing part/all of the trade early. Often reduces long-term edge unless justified by data.

**17. Ghost Liquidity**

Orders that aren’t visible but sit around visible levels. Cause sharp reactions or none at all. It’s just a surge of liquidity that isn’t visible on the books.

**18. Random Walk**

Price sometimes moves like noise. Most patterns don’t work unless they’re backed by logic. A Random Walk is a market that is 100% random. In other words, it is effectively a completely efficient market where no edge is possible. Real markets are of course different.

**19. Bracketed Limit Orders**

Pre-set entry, stop, and take-profit. Forces discipline. Removes intuition and discretion.

**20. Institutional Narrative Fallacy**

The idea that “smart money” always leaves clues. Usually marketing fluff. If it’s not testable, it’s not valid.

**21. Data Snooping**

Repeatedly looking at a data series from different angles to confirm something that you haven’t defined ahead of time often leading to insignificant and/or biased discoveries. Essentially looking too hard for patterns and finding things that don’t actually repeat. Typically kills forward performance.

**22. Drawdown**

How far your strategy drops from peaks in tests. Crucial for knowing how big your positions should be in advance. For example, a trader could have a max losing streak of 8 but your peak to trough could be 12x your risk (some wins followed by strings of losses repeatedly create this) – Super important to track and know. That’s the maximum drawdown you should be taking into account especially if working with prop firms.

**23. Dynamic Targeting**

Set targets based on real market structure - swing highs, lows, clusters of wicks. not arbitrary price movements e.g., 100 points, 100 handles, 100 pips, 100 ticks. Market is too dynamic for a one size fits all.

**24. Expectancy**

The average gain or loss per trade. Strategies don’t need high win rates - it needs consistency in the data and logical backing: Expectancy = average win × win rate − (1 − win rate) × average loss.

**25. Logic-Driven Rule** A rule built on how the market behaves - not what a shape on a chart looks like or some untested theory. For example purposes only, using the 3 wicks example. Bar 1 closes with a wick high; this shows that there was selling pressure. If the next candle interacts with bar 1’s high but fails to close above, creating another wick, it shows continued selling pressure. If on bar 3 it happens again, it shows compounded selling pressure. If it reverses, it should do so quickly. If price continues beyond the wicks, price should continue trending. Using a small stop loss relative to the target can create an edge if costs are managed properly.

https://preview.redd.it/06he0pjhq4hf1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e74092dc4e4d79246d039614cff702d44a92e24



[I track my trades using Tradezella.](https://preview.redd.it/7hezla1iq4hf1.png?width=1737&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e994e9ce84cc13d6c8cc394d623bd038556b82a)

For months, I thought I had a strategy problem. I was taking clean setups, trading my model, and trusting my edge but my P&L said otherwise. I ended up down over $3,300, with a 23.26% win rate and a score of just 46.45. My average R was 2.27, and I was going for 2R base hits with 4R runners but the problem wasn’t the math. It was the psychology of holding through losses, getting stopped out repeatedly, and chasing that one big winner to fix everything.



The red days stacked up. You can see it in the first chart, net daily P&L bled out nearly every session. My profit factor was under 1.0, and my consistency and drawdown metrics were completely skewed. Even on the rare days I won, the pressure of needing the trade to work was overwhelming. This kind of environment makes you force entries, revenge trade, and second-guess every setup.



Then I made one change, I lowered my risk-to-reward. I started taking profits at 1R to 1.5R and only held for more if the market was flowing clean. I focused on discipline, not dollars. I tracked everything religiously and shifted my mindset from “catch the big one” to “stack the small wins.” The shift was subtle, but the results were massive.



Fast forward to the second image, now I’m sitting at a 71.43% win rate, with a 3.04 profit factor and a score of 81.5. My P&L flipped from red to green, with +$2,465 in net profit across 28 trades. More importantly, look at the smoothness of that equity curve. I’m not trading better setups, I’m just managing them better. My average win is lower now ($184 vs $747 before), but my losses are also smaller, and they don’t break my confidence.



Your strategy isn’t always the issue. Sometimes your risk model is too aggressive for your psychology. By reducing pressure, I increased performance. That’s the real edge. Don’t fix what’s working, fix how you execute it. 



Put yourself in situations that keep you the most calm.

1mqlk32,2025-08-14,2025-08-14 22:55:26,How I make a living with a sub-50% win rate,"Most new traders think they need to be right 70 to 80% of the time to make money. The reality is, you can be wrong more than you’re right and still come out far ahead, if you manage risk properly. My win rate over this period was 43.5%, and my shorts were even lower at 41.6%. Yet, my equity curve kept climbing steadily.



The key is in my risk-to-reward ratio and trade expectancy. My average trade win/loss is 2.54. That means when I win, I make more than double what I lose on an average losing trade. My trade expectancy, the amount I expect to make per trade over time, sits at $99.42. This combination means that even with less than half of my trades being winners, the math works out in my favor.



You can see it in the PnL chart I’ve attached. There were drawdowns, sure, but the slope is positive because my losers are contained and my winners are allowed to run. My largest winning trade was $3,050, while my largest loss was $1,137. Keeping losses smaller and letting the big ones work is what makes the curve trend upward.



[I journal my trades using tradezella.](https://preview.redd.it/mwzlq6e4l3jf1.png?width=1650&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b23783ab5729477823a6ede06e6ee8754ac4ee)

Another thing that helps is consistency. My average daily win/loss stayed stable after the early volatility. Once I stopped overtrading and forced myself to stick to my setups, the chart smoothed out. That’s not an accident, it’s the direct result of following a process and tracking my performance trade by trade.



A big part of that process is my Forever Model setup. In simple terms, it’s a specific pattern I look for when the market sweeps a key level, shifts direction, and leaves behind a gap in price that often gets retested. I wait for that retest, look for confirmation that price is reacting, and then take my entry in the direction of that move. It’s nothing magical, it’s just reading liquidity and timing entries where the risk is smallest. If you want a video breakdown of it lmk, I'll send it to you for free, I've posted it on Reddit plenty of times.



The beauty of the Forever Model is that it keeps me patient. I’m not taking random trades all day. I’m waiting for the market to show its hand. That’s why my stats look the way they do, fewer trades, higher quality, bigger winners than losers. If you’re still struggling with consistency, find one setup that fits your personality and master it. That’s when your numbers start working for you instead of against you.",271,141,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1mqlk32/how_i_make_a_living_with_a_sub50_win_rate/,all,Due-diligence,0.96
1ia4568,2025-01-25,2025-01-25 21:51:17,"i just found out about wykcoff's method and smart money, i'm so pissed","i've heard about wykcoff before, but i recently stumbled upon it again and looked into in detail and as it relates to forex trading

and what i found out lead me down a rabbit hole that ultimately made me super pissed

first off, smart money are crooks

these are institutions that manipulate the markets in a systematic way, in order to fuck people out of their money repeatedly, like a well oiled machine

they do this through wykcoff's method

wkycoff's method is basically 4 phases: accumulation, uptrend, distribution, downtrend

smart money follows this formula to the letter each and every time they engage in the markets

this is because smart money is made up of institutions, and institutions make up 90% of the trading volume in forex

basically, institutions can do whatever the fuck they want, at any time

they have such high volume, they can literally cause candlesticks to move at will on the price charts

they use this ability to go through the 4 phases of wkycoff's method

they start by accumulating a bunch of the stock when prices are in a downtrend

dumb money, basically every trader on reddit, sees that prices are trending down, so they end up opening sell positions

smart money absorbs all the positions from dumb money

this causes a narrow and boring trading range that lasts DAYS

there is no continuation of the downtrend or trend reversal, it's just a ranging market

but during this time, smart money is accumulating. they are adding onto their stock and getting all of the supply in what looks like a quiet market!

they go even further than that

they use algorithms, and high frequency trading, to periodically push price below the trading range. this causes a bunch of stop loss orders to trigger, at which point smart money immediately buys again, accumulating more

or quite simply, smart money can place MASSIVE sell orders at the bottom of the trading range. sell orders so big that once they get triggered, price literally tumbles down on the price chart

which again triggers a bunch of stop loss orders to trigger. and then again, immediately at this time, smart money buys back all the asset they sold, and they buy back all the new supply that just entered the market due to the stop loss orders

smart money is basically doing liquidity grabs during this accumulation phase to continue their accumulation

finally, once they are done accumulating everything, and they are sure that no one has anymore stock available to sell.. smart money then moves the market upward!

dumb money thought the downtrend would continue, but no, that's not the case

smart money has taken the price upward

once the uptrend has finished, smart money then either decides to reaccumulate or move to the distribution phase..

distribution is the same as accumulation, but in reverse

after distribution, comes the downtrend, and after that, smart money may decide to redistribute, by selling to dumb money all over again

once accumulation or distribution is over, smart money has to start the whole process again if they decide to reaccumulate or redistribute, of getting dumb money to feed them so they can build up their position

this is how smart money manipulates dumb money.. they go through these 4 phases, over and over again

dumb money has no idea they are being played.. they have no knowledge as to what is happening, they just know that they are losing

they see price is going down so they sell, but they are selling to smart money who is accumulating all stock..

smart money can afford to buy everything, smart money can decide what direction they want price to go, and they can make it happen no matter what. because they have the money to do it.. it just takes them time to finally accumulate all the stock before they decide to make their move

smart money moves the market, dumb money has no idea how or why they keep losing

imagine someone just getting owned in a competition over and over, they have no idea why they are losing each time

no one tells them why and they can't see why

so they keep trying again and again, and they just keep losing

that is what smart money is doing to dumb money

it's fucking wild, how blissfully unaware dumb money is

i've seen people on reddit saying they've been trading and losing for years, like 5+ years they've been trading. and still they are losing money..

they are literally dumb money that is spending their life being manipulated by smart money...

this is some dystopian type shit that is going on here

1l7pvqo,2025-06-10,2025-06-10 00:32:44,7 Lessons I’ve Learned After 4 Years Trading Price Action,"I’ve been trading for 4 years now mostly futures, with a focus on price action and supply/demand. I studied Al Brooks, Carmine Rosato, and a bit of Wyckoff and some ICT, but most of what I’ve learned came from screen time, losses, and hundreds of hours spent journaling, backtesting, and reviewing trades.

Here’s what I’ve learned:

**1. Price tells the story before indicators do**  
Every indicator lags. Price doesn’t. Learn to read candles and structure like a language. Just learn from candle to candle and you can use indicators but don't rely on them.

**2. Every level you mark is a potential trap**  
Retail sees support/resistance. Smart money sees liquidity. Think about who’s trapped, not just where price might bounce. Don't try to predict where the price is going to go, just react and ride the wave.

**3. Patience is a position**  
Most of my worst trades came from jumping in early. Waiting for the right entry is a skill that took years to build. This was the hardest thing to master for me.

**4. First test of a zone is often the best**  
Whether it’s a supply or demand zone, that first touch usually has the cleanest reaction. After that, the edge starts to fade. I usually wait for a tap and stop hunt to perform.

**5. Stop trying to predict. Start reacting.**  
You’re not here to forecast price. You’re here to react to what it *does* and manage risk. That shift changed everything for me. Be an **Observer.**

**6. Context > Candle**  
A hammer in an uptrend means nothing. A hammer into a zone of liquidity after a sweep? That’s a setup worth watching. Are we in a bullish or bearish market? have we taken the high or low of the day? content is absolute key.

**7. Don’t underestimate journaling**  
Once I started tracking setups, wins/losses, emotions, and context consistently, my growth exploded. Journaling made this process 10x easier. It replaced my messy notebooks and gave me real insights. I also backtest regularly and review key trades inside the dashboard. I use to print charts, use sticky noys and bunch of notepads, very messy and would not retain anything.

I chart with **TradingView** for higher time frame structure, and use a **footprint chart in Sierra Chart** for order flow and execution detail. I journal every trade and log context, execution, and emotions using **TradeZella**, which has been a huge part of my growth.

1l9ram8,2025-06-12,2025-06-12 12:44:53,5 STAGES OF BECOMING A TRADER,"# STEP 1: “INNOCENT AND BLISSFULLY IGNORANT”

This is the very beginning when you step into trading. You know trading is a good way to make money because you’ve heard stories—about millionaires and all that. Unfortunately, just like when you first started driving, you think it’s easy—until you realize how truly difficult it is. The market goes up and down… What’s the secret in there? Let’s find out!

But soon enough, like the first time you sat behind the wheel, you quickly realize you don’t have a shred of skill to do this. You trade a lot and risk way too much. You open a position, it moves against you, so you close it, open another one in the opposite direction—only for it to move against you again… and on and on. You may see a few early wins, but that’s worse than nothing—it tricks your subconscious into thinking, “Oh, trading is easy.” You start risking even more. You want to get back what you lost, so you begin doubling down on every trade. You win a few times, but mostly you get battered—you lose heavily. You forget that you have no real skill in trading.

This stage typically lasts a few weeks. The market shifts quickly, and you rapidly move into Stage 2.

# STEP 2: “REALIZING YOUR OWN INADEQUACY”

In this stage, you recognize that trading requires a lot—skills, knowledge—and you need to learn. You realize you have no real trading skills, no foundation to make consistent money.

You start buying systems, e‑books, visiting trading websites—all hunting for the “holy grail.” You become a systems tester, switching methods day after day, never sticking long enough to see if they even work. Every time you find some indicator, you trick yourself into thinking it’ll make a difference.

You test systems, use moving averages, Fibonacci lines, support and resistance, pivots, RSI, DMI, ADX, and hundreds more—hoping your magical system will work instantly today. You try to catch tops and bottoms precisely with your indicators, only to realize you’re losing even more, convinced your system is still right.

You see other traders making money, and you wonder why you cannot. You ask countless questions—some so ridiculous they embarrass you later. You come to believe that all profitable traders are liars. “There’s no way they’re winning—if I tried everything I know, why are they winning and I'm not?” But they keep winning day after day, while your account drains.

You're like a stubborn child. Traders give advice, but you ignore it, continue overtrading, even if people call you crazy. You buy signals from “teachers,” but that doesn’t help. No matter how skilled the teacher is, you still lose—because nothing replaces experience, and you still think you “know” it all.

This stage can last a very long time. From casual conversations and personal experience trading, Stage 2 often lasts 1 to nearly 3 years. It’s during this phase you want to quit. Around 60% of new traders drop out within the first 3 months—and that’s good, because if trading were easy, we’d all be millionaires. About 20% stick around a year—and blow their accounts. The remaining 20% endure the full 3 years—and even then, only 5–10% move forward to sustainable profits. These are real numbers, not guesses. Even after three years, it’s hardly smooth. Talk to traders who’ve been doing this 5+ years—none got there fast. There may be exceptions, but I’ve never seen one.

# STEP 3: “THE EUREKA MOMENT”

At the end of Stage 2, you realize that the system isn’t what makes the difference. You discover you can actually make money with a single moving average—nothing else—if you pair it with proper mindset and money management. You start reading about trading psychology, empathizing with characters in those books, and finally you hit that “Eureka” moment.

This moment connects to something deep within you. You suddenly realize that nobody can predict the market a few seconds or even 20 minutes ahead. So you stop worrying about what others think—how news will affect the market. You develop your own approach.

You focus on one system, refine it in your own way, and begin to feel confident in your risk thresholds. You only take trades when your system shows a high probability setup. If a position goes against you, you don’t get emotional—you know you can’t predict, and you quickly close losing trades. The next trade—or the one after—will have a greater chance of winning, because you know your system works.

You stop obsessing over each trade’s outcome and start evaluating performance on a weekly basis. You understand that one bad trade doesn’t mean your system is broken. In a flash you realize the only variable in trading is consistency and discipline—follow your system rules, every single trade, no matter what. In the long run, you’ll come out on top.

You learn about position sizing, leverage, how much to risk per account—you truly *get* it now. You smile, remembering those who warned you a year ago. You weren’t ready then—but you are now. The “Eureka” moment hits when you truly accept that you *cannot predict the market*.

# STEP 4: “CONSCIOUS MASTERY”

Now you trade only on your system’s signals. You approach every trade the same—win or lose. You embrace risk so winning trades can fully develop—because you know your system makes more money overall—and you swiftly exit losing trades so they don’t hurt your account.

At this point, most of your trades end around breakeven. You have winning days and losing days, weeks with +100 pips and weeks at –100 pips—overall, you break even and preserve capital. You know you’re on the right path. You keep thinking about your trading process.

Over time you begin to make slightly more than you lose. You might win 20 pips one day, lose 35 pips the next—and you don’t worry you’ve given back your profits, because you trust you’ll get them back. Soon you’re making consistent profits—25 pips one week, 50 the next—and it goes on. This stage lasts about six months.

# STEP 5: “UNCONSCIOUS COMPETENCE”

Like cooking or driving—each day, you trade and everything happens almost automatically. You perform without thinking. You start taking larger trades, and winning 200 pips in a day no longer excites you more than a single pip.

In an almost magical trading achievement, you’ve mastered your emotions—and now your account grows swiftly. Newbies ask for your advice and actually listen. You see your younger self in their questions. You offer guidance—but you know most will forget it—immature traders, eager for fast riches. A few might reach your level—some fast, some slow—but so many never leave Stage 2. A small minority do.

Now trading is no longer thrilling—it’s actually a bit dull. Once you’re proficient, like any job, it becomes just work. Your time is spent refining your method for maximum profit without increasing risk. The method doesn’t change—it improves. You develop what some call “intuition.”

Now you can proudly say, “I’m a forex trader.” But honestly, it’s just a job—nothing special to broadcast.

Remember: only 5% truly succeed. Why do others fail? Not due to lack of ability—but lack of endurance: inability to shift mindset, adapt, and change mental patterns when circumstances change. Losers want “get‑rich‑quick,” approach the market with fixed beliefs, refuse to see the truth.

I’m glad I entered trading wanting to “get rich fast.” Now I view it as “get rich slow.”

If you’re thinking about quitting, I have one question:  
**“How many years would you invest in college if you knew that, once you graduated, you’d earn a million dollars a year?”**

Take care, and I wish you good luck in your trading.

1m08ea5,2025-07-15,2025-07-15 00:28:35,5 Years In — Here’s What Finally Made Me Consistent,"I’ve been in this game for 5 years now. Blown accounts, overtraded, switched strategies a dozen times. The journey looked like this:

Year 1-2: Massive losses, constant confusion

Year 3-4: Started journaling, slowed down, started seeig some profitability

Year 5: Locked in consistency and started stacking payouts

Like most traders, I thought the key was in the strategy. I jumped from indicators to price action, to ICT, to SMC, to trend lines, thinking the next system would finally unlock it. But here’s the truth:

It was never about the strategy.

It was about how I executed it.

Once I stopped trying to guess market direction and started reacting to what’s in front of me, things changed. I mark zones. I wait for price to hit those areas. If there’s a clear rejection, I enter. If not, I don’t. No forcing. No FOMO.

Now the only thing I care about? Risk to Reward.

I shoot for 1:2.5 or better.

Win rate sits around 45–50%.

That’s all I need.

You don’t need to be right 70% of the time. You need to be disciplined when you're wrong and maximize when you're right. Most people lose because they cut winners too soon or hold losers too long.

If you’re stuck, here’s what helped me:

Stop switching strategies every week

Focus on a single setup and master it

Set high R:R targets and stick to them

Size down and stay consistent

Journal everything until your edge is obvious

Forget being perfect. Focus on being repeatable.

That’s when trading finally made sense.

1igu860,2025-02-03,2025-02-03 12:15:34,How to win in trading: keep going after everyone else stops,"Hi everyone,

I'm a husband, a dad of five, and a full-time trader.

Making the leap to full-time trading has been quite a journey, and along the way, I’ve picked up some concepts that have helped me navigate the ups and downs.

As I’ve been writing out these ideas for myself, I thought they might hopefully be encouraging to others—whether you're considering the transition to full-time trading or just looking to refine your approach.

**Here's my post:**

Last week, I had coffee with an aspiring trader. The last time we talked, he was bursting with fresh ideas and eager to make his mark in the trading world.

But when I asked how things were going, and if he was still working toward making trading his full-time career, he hesitated.

""Trading was way harder than I expected,"" he said. ""I lost money and decided to stop. I tried stocks and options—options were cool, but I just couldn’t grasp it.

I realized it would take years to get good at this and I’m not ready to invest that kind of time right now. Maybe I’ll try again someday.""

Unfortunately, this reaction is all too common. But why is it the norm for so many?

Yes, the barrier to entry in trading is high—but here’s the thing: so is everything else.

For example: the average acceptance rate for Ivy League schools is under 4%. Only the top 8-10% of realtors make six figures. Just 5% of all Amazon sellers generate over $1 million in revenue. The reality is that the barrier to success in *any* field is high.

I don’t think trading is anything extraordinary. It’s not some mysterious ""boogeyman"" of business that's harder than other career paths. I believe it’s totally achievable for the person who truly wants it and is willing to put in the work—just like earning an Ivy League education, excelling in real estate, or hitting $1 million in Amazon sales. It all comes down to the individual and their commitment.

That’s why it’s frustrating to see new traders give in to self-doubt. So much potential gets derailed by short-term discouragement.

Today, I want to offer some encouragement. A career in trading isn’t just worth pursuing—it’s absolutely possible when built on the right foundation.

Let’s flip the script on this undeserved doubt and push your trading journey forward.

# The big problem with short term thinking

When I talk to struggling traders, or those hoping to transition to full-time, there’s a common theme: they view trading as a fast and easy path to riches. But in reality, it’s just like any other vocation or business.

Think about it—when else is taking the long road ever seen as a problem? Plumbers, dentists, real estate agents, and restaurant owners don’t have an issue with putting in the time and effort to get where they want to go.

What if we as traders adopted the same mindset?  
Trading is a business, after all.

What if, instead of thinking like most new traders who focus on days and weeks, we shifted to thinking in terms of months and years?

Whenever I face a decision, I like to ask myself: ""If I choose this path, what’s the alternative?"" In trading, the alternative to long-term thinking is, of course, short-term thinking—and that’s where the real problems start. This mindset can lead to things like:

* **Rushing to make a profit right away.** What if a restaurant tried this? They might cut corners by using cheap ingredients, skimp on marketing, skip employee training, and ignore the fundamentals—leading to few, if any, return customers.
* **Making quick decisions with large amounts of money, without the experience to back it up.** What if a new plumber took out a huge loan for tons of equipment and work trucks, without any real customers or business experience? Wouldn’t it make more sense to use what he has, build a customer base, and then figure out what tools he actually needs?
* **Jumping from one strategy to the next, without giving them enough time.** What if a real estate agent, looking for leads, tried knocking on doors in a local neighborhood for a few days, then gave up to focus on SEO for their website, just because they didn’t get immediate results? Had they stuck with the door-knocking strategy a little longer, they might have seen a lead come through and realized it was working.
* **Starting each business day without a clear process or routine.** Imagine a local dentist who had no set schedule, no patient records, and no clear steps for addressing patient needs. It would be chaos.

Notice a theme yet? *(Good things take time!)*  
Viewing trading as a long-term endeavor is what truly makes the difference.

# But what if you’re still stuck?

I know what you might be thinking: ""That sounds great, but I'm still scared. I’m afraid of starting and failing. I’m not in the right financial position to start a business, let alone trading.""

And that’s okay. You’re not alone. Every single trader, no matter their experience, feels that type of fear. Every day.

My heart still skips a beat when I see the clock ticking down to the opening bell, even after years of trading. Millions of people—wannabe traders and elite fund managers alike—feel the same way. That fear doesn’t disappear overnight. It may never go away completely, no matter what business you’re in.

But here’s my encouragement to you:

What you want is just on the other side of the unknown.

Every day you take a small step into the unknown, every time you take another trading rep, or make a small process improvement, they all add to your confidence to keep going. Because remember, you’re thinking long-term, just like a real business.

This is how you win.

# It's time to win

I know—words are nice—but how do you actually move forward? What are some practical steps you can use to move forward in your trading journey?

Let me put it this way: If you wanted to start a plumbing business, how would you ensure success, stay profitable, and keep going even when others have stopped?

1. **Start with the basics.** Use new information to help lower fear of the unknown. First, you’d figure out exactly what you need to start—certifications, tools, insurance, and so on. You’d probably watch a few YouTube videos from different people to get an overview of what it's like. (I really appreciate SMB Capital’s free trading content - no need to pay for anything, just learn all you can.)
2. **Get hands-on practice.** Next, as an aspiring plumber, you’d start practicing with small jobs around the house or for close family, just to get those reps in and learn what it really takes. (This could look like taking small reps, I’m a big believer in one-share trades. Buy and sell one share only, until you have the data needed to show you where you’re profitable and you can start to scale.)
3. **Track everything.** As you go, you might write everything down. Maybe film or take pictures of each plumbing job so you can study them later. You’d track what you enjoy, what areas are low-stress and easy for you, and what mistakes you make—along with specific ways to fix them. (I like using Notion as a free way to start tracking things. Also Edgewonk is a great low-cost option.)
4. **Build a routine.** You then start forming a daily routine. You’d maybe go to class to learn the trade in the morning, do homework in the afternoon, and then maybe work on a small jobs for practice at night or on weekends. You’d then make adjustments each day, noting things like: *""I did poorly on my last exam because I stayed up too late. I’ll go to bed at 9 pm to focus better in class, as well as have more energy for my plumbing jobs.""*(In trading, this is what’s known as your “process”. Your routine that you follow, which you know gives you the best chance for success each day.)
5. **Repeat and improve.** The key in any business is repetition. You’d keep following the same steps every day until you get so good that you either have the pick of which plumbing company to work for, or, start your own business. Then assume it would take one to three years to get there. (This is when you find your “edge” — a repeatable trade setup that you know gives you positive expected value over time.)
6. **Bonus.** Along the way, you might only buy what you really need and try to practice frugality—no loans, using your own truck and tools, adding only as needed. This keeps the risk low while you learn and build your business. (This means keeping your costs and overhead low, in order to preserve and save up capital to trade with. And no need to overspend on fancy software or tools in the beginning— the focus should be on the fundamentals.)

# The bottom line

Let the aspiring trader at the beginning of this post serve as a reminder.

When it comes to building a trading career, you’re faced with two paths:

One path is focused on the short term, driven by immediate results and quick wins. This often leads to frustration and burnout, causing many to quit before they’ve given themselves a real chance to succeed.

The other path—which offers a much higher probability of success—is grounded in long-term thinking. It’s about committing to continuous learning, persevering through challenges, and allowing time to develop your skills and strategy.

Success in trading—or in any field—isn’t owned by the smartest, the luckiest, or even the most naturally talented. It belongs to those who *stay in the game*.

The truth is, every master trader, every successful entrepreneur, and every top performer started where you are: uncertain, inexperienced, and full of doubt. The only difference? They decided to push through and embrace the long game, and to build their foundation one step at a time.

So, what will you choose? Will you let short-term struggles define you? Or will you shift your mindset, commit to the process and lifestyle, and give yourself the time needed to truly succeed?

Trading is a career; not a game.

**This has practical and personal lessons from pain**

Your friends, families and communities all have subtle (and not so subtle) effects on your mindset, motivation and your chances of long term success.

Most traders don't realise how much their environment, both virtual and in person, weighs them down before it's too late. Most quit. Others waste years. It's a silent killer.

**This post breaks it all down (8-9 Minutes reading time according my medium article)**

* The social mistakes that silently sabotage your mindset
* The traps caused by poor social boundaries.
* Clear, actionable solutions to protect your focus and peace
* How to build a private, powerful environment that actually helps you win

**This is a critical piece on trading psychology. Takes less than 10m to read, over an hour to write and years to learn.**

# Most traders only think about psychology in terms of executing trades. But the truth tells a different story.

# 1. Social mistakes every trader should avoid

Trading is a game of numbers and averages. It relies on the outcome of many, many trades.

Why tell someone how your trades are going when you have only placed 30? One of the biggest mistakes traders make socially is letting people know that they are planning on making this absurd amount of money and they have this trading strategy that will do it for them. Fast forward 3 years, and they continue to let people know. - Ali

As much as some traders try to appear humble about their intent, we all trade for money.

There’s nothing wrong with having that attitude. Veiling it with “I don’t trade for the money” or “don’t trade for the money” isn’t helpful without context. - Ron

# Personal Experiences with this mistake (We’ve made them) - Ron

**I used to talk about trading and was overt with my small successes when younger.**

When I was a teenager in school (around 16), I made close to £200 in one night on GBPUSD whilst sleeping out of luck. I was ecstatic; I told friends, my parents, and even my teachers. Luckily I was too young for it to be consequential. People probably didn’t take me seriously, so it wasn’t so consequential (luckily).

**For most people they’ve done something similar**

Doing this optimistic talk even with parents or your significant other creates performance anxiety. People will start to ask you, “How is your trading going?” or get concerned for you when they don’t understand it’s just another drawdown. 

**When I was 17-18, I had small wins here and there, short periods of profitability followed by devastation.** 

When I was profitable, it was met with scepticism. When I was struggling, I was looked down upon.

By the time I was 18-19, I understood this. I learnt these lessons the hard way. Many don’t.

When I made my first life-changing money in my trading (£30k was lifechanging at the time), my family didn’t know for over a year. By then it was permanent. I didn’t flaunt.

**I set social boundaries on asking about my trading and explained why.** 

I’ve made and lost thousands in university lectures and labs and didn’t say a thing.

# Don’t subject yourself to this.

**I remember my grandmother saying to me,** “Make sure you don’t lose it all.” “Are you still gambling?”,

**My mother said something along the lines of,** “I see you’re trying a lot with this. I don’t want to be mean, but why don’t you get a real job?” Ouch 

**And my Father cornering me and questioning my goals** “What are you going to do? What’s your goal? What job are you going to get?”

This is the easiest way to get performance anxiety-induced stress or feel demoralised, and it was all preventable by keeping my mouth shut, but I didn’t.

**It’s not that your family doesn’t like you; it’s that they don’t understand trading.** 

They don’t understand it or believe in it. A lot just see trading as gambling.

**They do it because they care not to destroy you**

These effects are often subconscious and still weigh you down.

I’m telling you now, if my family (especially my mother) knew I was in a £100k drawdown when I was (>130k USD), she would freak out, and things would be tough even post-recovery. Don’t even make me imagine it. It’d be beyond unpleasant.

**It’s not about hiding what you do; it’s about having peace in your environment whilst performing.**

# 1.2 Telling or encouraging family or friends to trade - Ron

I want to keep this short. If you do this, you’ll create unrealistic expectations because of stimulation from your successes or retail social media BS.

In UK college (16-18), when someone approached me with TradingView open on my phone

I was silly enough to tell him that I was trading profitably at the time and talked about it.

**They’ll get clingy, fast. Especially when you’re “profitable”** 

This is noise that you can’t afford to have in your development stage. It slows you down. You can still run while wearing a 10 kg/20 lb weighted vest if you’re conditioned; it’s still noticeably harder. 

Even when full-time. If my distant family or friends ask me, I still play it down and pretend like I do something else. It’s not worth your sanity.

When you buy luxury goods such as a Rolex watch, you don’t need to explain, flaunt, or post it. Don’t get pushed into revealing what you don’t want to; some are persistent or manipulative.

**If you want a trading partner such as me and Ali**

Make sure you both work efficiently and are both traders. Networking is available in data driven groups. Have high standards for traders you talk to. It matters.

**The thing to do instead is play down what you do or, at most, say you’re just looking into it. I know it feels good to talk about making money, but the best answer is no.**

If they witness you trading live, just say it’s a demo account.

If a person in public approaches you (has happened countless times to me and Ali), play it down and say invest in the S&P 500. Do not waste your time.

Listen to me! We’ve made these mistakes. Don’t. Do. It!

It’s best to be quiet; it’s far easier to succeed under these conditions.

If people don’t know you trade, it’s even better. 

# Keep Quiet and set boundaries.

The short-term dopamine spikes aren’t worth it. **Do not confuse this for humility. You have a positive P&L to register.**

# 2. Your environment for growth and why it matters: Trading Groups

Sharpen Your Edge by Choosing Your Circle - Ron

**These aren’t opinions. This is behavioural psychology innate in us.**

**If you’re serious about having a real trading career, you’ll take action on this.**

***You owe yourself more.***

**One of the biggest reasons smart people don’t make it in trading isn’t a lack of skill. It’s the lack of environmental control.**

Most of you are still hanging around Communities full of entertaining but directionless chatter, i.e., waffle.

You’re soaking in the opinions of people who haven’t built anything, haven’t refined anything, and haven’t proven anything beyond a few lucky MT4/MT5 or Journal screenshots

**Now I need you to think about this logically.**

If someone spends a lot of their time with smokers, even if they tell themselves, “I’ll never smoke; that’s not me,” odds are eventually they will, even if it’s just trying one. 

Or testing that one logically flawed trading concept…

**It’s not always a direct influence. It’s subtle. It shifts your baseline without you even noticing it’s innate in us; we are human beings.**

You can like the cigarette; you could get positive backtest data on something baseless. Is that noise worth it if you don’t want to smoke? Is that noise worth it if you want to succeed in trading?

**You might not copy trades. But you’ll start absorbing the bad reasoning.** 

The loose discipline or approach. Shallow risk thinking. And broken retail logic.

And without realising it, you’ve let noise interfere with your trading once again - That gets expensive.

**Here’s the uncomfortable truth about most trading communities**

The moment you decided to get serious about trading. Truly not serious

You have to choose to block out negative influences. That means talking to and surrounding yourself with sharp, structured thinkers. People with systems, data, and discipline. Not just good vibes and memes. I know it’s comfortable, but that was never enough. 

Remember If you’re serious about having a real trading career, you’ll take action on this.

**You owe yourself more.**

Now we get it. You probably like some of the people in these groups, and that’s completely fine. Stay in touch with the smart ones if you want. 

That’s what I did with Ali.

During your development phase while you’re still building your initial edges and refining your trading psychology, it’s important to shelter your eyes from laymen - You need to cut the noise. 

**You need direction, not noise and stimulation.**

Because you expose yourself to logical flaws, emotional responses, and low-effort posts and thinking, the more that standard becomes yours psychologically. 

**Remember that this isn’t an opinion; it’s behavioural psychology**

# 3. Ego

There is both a social and a personal consequence of ego. The focus will be placed on the social aspect, as that forms the basis of this document.

Traders have egos. We have seen this in almost everything. Sometimes traders struggle to accept other trader's ideas, and they will always want to impose their thought processes even if they have yet to show any sort of system or returns. This is a problem because most traders lose. 

People in europe are forced to constantly see most clients lose money on their broker but they still believe they aren't going to be that guy, never underestimate the ego of man.

Even based on probability, what are the chances that any one trader with an unchecked ego has managed to crack trading? What are the chances that one trader has figured out everything to do with the market? **Likely less than a few percent.**

A trader's emotion is linked to their ego as well.

They feel an emotional attachment to their current trading style, which they have probably developed over the years. Unfortunately, most traders lose money (easily near or above 95%), so the question a trader must ask themselves is if their trading style is the way it should be done. Just based on statistics, almost everyone is not doing it correctly. Yes, they may have the underlying understanding, but their application is lacking, and there are things they have not yet defined explicitly. For instance, traders think psychology is detrimental to trading, but that is not trading. That is gambling. **The attachment to any existing style of trading has to be removed.** 

We feel no attachment to any strategy or style, which is why we managed to progress and write so many documents grounded in logic.                                                                       

Without this lack of an attachment, we would have been stuck on trendlines and crayons on a chart for the past few years. We realised early on that the only way to do this is to do what nobody else does properly and to have our knowledge so precise that it can be compiled without logical flaws, as we have done with the documents. - Ali

# Being too humble won’t work. Delusion won’t either.

The only way to make proper returns is by understanding and being able to apply everything from the chart itself to the analysis behind the data, properly, with no logical flaws. - Ali

# As clear as I can be

If you want a real shot at this, leave directionless trading groups. For now. Cut ties with trading environments that dilute your sentience, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. Immerse yourself where precision is normal. Where deep work is respected, not dismissed. Where sharp thinking is the minimum

**When you go full-time one day, and many of you will (if you've read this far),** you’ll likely lose that desire for old noise anyways. Entertainment stops being the goal when real mastery in profitable strategy design and trading becomes the pursuit.

Until then, give yourself the best chance. Choose your environment the way you’d choose your mentor. Intentionally.

1cwqpdn,2024-05-20,2024-05-20 17:16:44,How I've beaten the S&P for 16 straight months,"I’ve been trading and investing for over 25 years and over the last 16 months I’ve beaten the S&P 500 every month and realized a 110% annual rate of return.  I wanted to share my approach and how I've found success.

Some background: 25 years ago I started as a long-term value investor inspired by Warren Buffett. While I still allocate a portion of my funds to this type of investing, my portfolio's risk profile has evolved. Post-COVID, I tried day trading for the first time, combining value investing with volatility trading. Over the past 2.5 years, I’ve refined a strategy that has consistently beaten the market for the past 16 months. Last year, my portfolio grew by 110%, and it’s up 30%+ so far in 2024 with a win rate over 75%.

My current strategy relies on automated systems to identify short-term trends (1-4 weeks) in specific industries or markets. Once these trends are identified, I focus on the best companies to capitalize on them based on momentum. I usually hold a position for 1-4 weeks or until the momentum fizzles and then I either cut my loss or take my profit.  Here’s the breakdown on what I’m doing in the current market:

 **Screening the Market:**

* **Filter for Consistent Growth**:  I begin by filtering companies with a solid track record of consistent revenue and earnings growth and a market cap of over $2B. This ensures I’m focusing on growing businesses.
* **Analyst Ratings**:  Next, I target companies with recent average analyst buy ratings, indicating positive sentiment and potential for growth. This is crucial since institutional trading often follows these ratings changes.
* **Volatility is Key**:  As a swing trader, I look for relatively volatile stocks. Volatility provides the necessary price swings to take advantage of short-term trends. Typically, I target stocks with a 1-month volatility greater than 2.5%.
* **Avoid Earnings**:  Earnings reports can be highly volatile, so I avoid any stock with earnings coming up in the next 2 weeks to mitigate unnecessary risk.

This process usually narrows the list down to 50-150 stocks at any given time. But I’m not investing in all of these.  Next I filter them by momentum. 

 **Selecting the Right Stocks:**  I use a couple indicators + price/volume action to determine which stocks look like they have some momentum that I can ride.

* **Momentum is the name of the game**:  I use a combination of volume-weighted RSI + Heikin Ashi candles to identify stocks gaining momentum. This reduces my list to 10-20 stocks that are likely to continue their upward trend and hit the right mix of items.
* **Hard Stops Based on Momentum**:  I implement hard stops based on momentum rather than price, cutting losers quickly when their momentum fizzles out to avoid holding underperforming stocks.

This usually results in 2-5 stock to buy each week.  I average about 15 stocks per month.  So now I've bought some stocks.  The most important part is managing them to reduce losses and maximize profits.

**Managing my Positions:**

* **No Love for a Trade**:  Emotional attachment to a trade is a death sentence to that trade. If a stock's momentum dies, I cut the loss, regardless of how promising it once seemed.
* **Profit is King**:  I hold a trade until the momentum dies.  Sometimes that means a trade profits 2%.  Sometimes 50%.  And sometimes (about 25% of the time) it's a loss.  But the goal is capital preservation and riding winners.

Downside to this strategy is it involves considerable chart time, but it’s tailored to my brain and risk profile.  And so far the returns have been worth the effort.  During this stretch beating the market I've placed 305 trades.  There are lots of ways to make money in the market.  This is just one way that works for me.  And it may not work in 6 months or it might work for the next decade.  But I wanted to share while it is working.  Hope this provides some insight and ideas to the group.

Happy trading!

*Tools:  I use Trading View for my stock screener and build a watch list.  I use alerts to highlight the stocks that hit my momentum criteria from that watch list and then place the trade in Thinkorswim.  It's not fully automated.  I want to check each chart before I decide to execute each trade.*",240,80,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1cwqpdn/how_ive_beaten_the_sp_for_16_straight_months/,all,Strategy,0.94

And now we’ve got quantum computers coming soon, plus ETFs, banks, and giant investment firms all jumping in. Feels like the hype bubble is getting way too big, and I can’t shake the feeling that one of these cycles is gonna be the last. Maybe not this one, but the one after Trump’s next term?

Like, what even is Bitcoin at this point? The price only goes up as long as there’s fresh hype and new buyers, but institutions are the last ones left to pile in. And let’s be real, they’re not here for the tech, they just need dumb money for liquidity. It’s starting to look like a glorified Ponzi where regular traders exist just to get farmed by the big guys.

1kbsohs,2025-04-30,2025-04-30 18:00:37,38% Win Rate. $48K Profit. Here’s How I Made It Work:,"Do you adjust your position size based on conviction or stick to fixed risk?

This month, I only won 38% of my trades… but I still walked away with $48,406.70 in profit.

The secret? I stopped focusing on being right and started focusing on being selective.

When I had clear confirmation, liquidity sweeps, strong structure, and clean context, I sized up.  
When things were mid-range or uncertain, I either stayed out or sized down.

📈 April 23rd? +$14.3K across 29 trades.  
One great day flipped the entire month.

Journaling intensely and collecting data over the years helped me catch this pattern. Reviewing my edge weekly showed me that a few solid trades with high R multiples can do all the heavy lifting.

I’m not chasing high win rates anymore, just when my edge shows very clean, and I execute. Controlled risk for the most part, and big payoffs when it’s time to strike.

I am in the 8 figure range. Besides 2020 and a handful of crazy weeks, most weeks felt smooth. Would’ve never thought I’d reach these heights. Find your niche and stick to it. Surprisingly what helped me most in trading was when I learned to count cards in blackjack. It taught me so much discipline because of how boring it was but it was working and seeing cold hard cash in my hands made it more realistic. I sat at tables placing fixed bets and I was able to see all the swings and craziness that made me realize anything can happen. I once lost 27 hands in a row which I just couldn’t believe. Because of this I nailed prioritizing risk management and capital preservation. Consistency consistency consistency. I was once a gambling degenerate for 1-2 years and lost tons of money. I was never afraid to take the risk and LOVED the volatility.

1lbyemw,2025-06-15,2025-06-15 07:45:33,How To Become a Consistent Profitable Trader (My Favourite Set Up),"Hey guys, I’ve had a few comments on reddit and instagram to explain the ATH (all time high) breakout trades I take on a daily basis and so here it is.

I’m a full time trader and I hope you guys find this helpful.

To explain this in great detail would take hours upon hours however I’ve wrote up a simplified description to make it digestible.

“We do not trade ideas we trade set ups”

As professional traders you should not be trading ideas, you should be trading sets ups. Something that you can measure, replicate, improve upon and learn from. Not random events.

Here’s an example of how a novice traders mind may work:

You see an article pop up about a Tesla car that was on auto pilot and crashed into a stationary car causing injury to both the driver and the passenger. Your instant thoughts are “This could effect Tesla’s stock price” and you put it on your watchlist for the day. Now the issue with this is this the specific event Is not measurable. The way in which the stock reacts will be random and you won’t be able to use the stats for any other trades. Making the event a coin flip and therefore a gamble.

Focus on set ups not ideas. It’s ok to have an idea for the set up but the set up HAS TO BE THERE.

Now lets get straight to it.

What is an all time high breakout?

1. The answer is simple. This is when a stock breaks out into a new ATH.

Why is this such a good set up to take?

1. Because everybody who’s EVER brought the stock is now in the GREEN “no reason to sell” and everybody who’s shorting the stock is now red “May look to cover”

Here’s how it works:

A lot of professional traders, myself included, love the all time high break outs for many reasons. The main being the explosive moves it can often provide. Due to this a lot of day traders, swing traders, investors, funds and algorithms will monitor the market for these potential plays. Meaning they’re often on the buying side. This is why you can see what appears to be a stock doing very little yet the moment it trickles over it’s previous ATH high it can rally for days.

It’s called “buying the breakout”

You see the market is run on mostly Human emotion, we know this but very few understand how that works.

The reason most people lose money in the market is they are untrained and do not have the discipline to handle their own barbaric emotions.

Here’s why that’s important.

For this example we’ll call the company $STONKS it’s been on the market for 3 years and it’s current all time high is $10. Some bad news comes out and the stock gaps down to $8 causing people to panic sell and the stock to drop even further. Over the next 12 months it drops to a low of $5 until finally reclaiming to today at $9.90. It’s been consolidating between $9 and $9.90 for 10 days.

For the past year there has been a lot of people bag holding. Those who brought at the previous all time high have seen their investment drop by 50% and slowly recover. In between this time a lot of people have cut their loses, some have averaged down, new investors have “brought the dip” and we’re now back to where we was a year ago.

Now we have a few things at play here.

1. Those who rode through the entire year, the 50% drop and who haven’t sold now at break even clearly have no intention to sell.
2. Out of those who brought the dip some will have sold and some and still holding onto their shares even though the price has been stagment the past 10 days.
3. For the past 10 days people have been buying consistently and have been paying $9 or above for the stock. Showing a growing interest and price acceptance at these prices.
4. People who shorted the stock are now either at break even or at a loss.
5. Anybody new who wants to purchase some shares has currently got to pay all time high prices.

The longer we consolidate at these price the more powerful the move can become, why you ask?

Because it has more chance of the float being rotated. Understand that the first time $STONKS went up to $10 1 year ago the average price paid by an investor may have been $3 which meant a lot of profit taking occurred. When the bad news hit a lot of those investors jumped ship. Causing more supply than demand and therefore the price to drop.

Fast forward to today and the longer it consolidates above $9 the high the AVG price held will be. When this happens the buyers are literally sitting on basically no loss nor no gain giving them no reason to sell.

For those unaware, if you short a stock the only way to get out for a loss is to cover your position. This in turn means “buying the stock”. Creating more buying pressure. Short positions will often risk in this scenario the all time high. Meaning if it breaks they start to cover. If they start to cover it increases buying pressure and with buying pressure increasing the stock moves up (extremely simple explanation).

So we as traders recognise the stock is setting up for an ATH breakout and here’s what we do.

We decide we want to risk $2,000 in the stock.

We buy $500 worth at 9.20 known as a starter position and we wait.

A week goes by and it’s still chopping between this range. A press release then comes out (a bullish catalyst). The market opens are $STONKS see’s a huge 15 minute candle at open. The largest amount of volume it’s seen in months. On that volume it breaks $10 and instantly jumps to $10.50.

We managed to get our other $1,500 in at $10.20 bringing our average to roughly $9.90 a share. We move our stop loss to below the previous ATH with some breathing room AKA $9.50/share.

Everybody who now has shares in this stock prior to today is in the green, they’re estactic. Those who held through the entire past year and refused to sell are now mentioning how they’re in profit on an investment they made to work colleagues.

Short positions are now aware there’s no resistance and start covering “buying shares”. FOMO buyers who are “trading the news” (not a set up ;) ) are now buying in. Professional swing traders are buying the break out, day traders are buying the opening drive. Everybody is buying..

The stock closes at $12 marking a 25% daily gain. Barrons, CNBC, MSN all post above how $STONKS rallied into ATH due to X,Y,Z

The following morning the stock gaps up. People are hyped, pre market goes wild and opens at $16.

We instantly sell half…

The stock is extremely extended as new investors flurry in, we sell them some more. There’s now 25% left of our original investment.

We move our stop loss under PM support and go to focus on the next set up. The same set up. Something we can measure. Something we take day in day out.

If the stock goes to 20 then we don’t get annoyed we could have missed out on further profits as it wasn’t our trade.

The stock taps 20, massive selling occurs and settles around 14. Where it stays for months, consolidationg. Meanwhile, we’re just waiting for it to once again set up.

So how do I find these trades?

I use trading view, I create a list of sectors such as EVs, Solar, Tech, AI etc etc and I scan through each day. Literally just flick through. Is the stock near it’s ATH? If not, I go to the next and the next.

My indicators are as follows.

Volume Profile, RSI (for the daily only)

That’s it.

If you master just this single set up you can make money consistently. Why? Because it’s measurable, you can improve upon it. You can learn from each event but most importantly you have a set plan where the market is in your favour for the outcome to work. Never under estimate human emotion.

I post all my trades on Instagram at the moment but I’ll look into posting my watchlist here too if it’ll help you guys.

1f91zzp,2024-09-04,2024-09-04 15:18:29,Here's what I learned from backtesting hundreds of different trading strategies in the last two years,"So, over the last two years I dove deep into the world of backtesting for trading strategies—like, full-on coded my own tools for it on TradingView.  If you're not familiar, backtesting is when you take a trading strategy, run it against historical data, and see how it would have performed. Sounds simple, but trust me, the insights it gives you can be a major eye-opener.

I built my tools on TradingView, mainly because a frind of mine wanted me to code one for him for his specific strategy. So I thought why not give it a go and see how other strategies peform. And it's also easy to share these tools on TradingView, so we both tried to test as many of the strategies everyone was praising on YouTube, etc.. So everytime I finished coding a script I gave my friend access to it and we both started backtesting for hours and hours and were sharing our results looking for the holy grail. It was pretty straightforward at first: open a chart on TradingView with enough backtesting data, add the script to the chart, press start, wait a few minutes, and then track profits, losses, drawdowns, etc. We added these results to an excel-file which became big as hell and soon gave me headached each time I opened that file. But once I started testing all these different strategies, the reality hit me—most of them failed to stay consistently profitable in the long run.

We're talking about strategies that look amazing over a couple of months or even a year. But zoom out to a longer time horizon, and suddenly they're losing more than they're winning. Volatility is a killer, and markets can be ruthless.

All these YouTube videos about strategies being tested 100 or even 1,000 times are all full of shit. I hate to break it to you, but strategies might give you 250% profits in one year, and the next year the same strategy will wipe out your whole account and take your wife away with it.

The crazy thing is, unless you hit a sweet spot, most strategies won't beat the market. The sweet spot I noticed? Roughly 20-30% annual returns. That’s the golden range where you’re making serious gains but not taking excessive risks that lead to a wipeout during rough patches. The only strategies that I found that make consistent gains were in that annual profit range after commissions, spreads and all other fees. Too many traders get sucked into chasing 100%+ gains in a year, but that kind of strategy often burns out, leaving you with massive drawdowns or complete whipeouts when things inevitably go south.

So what did I take away from all this? The big lesson: consistency beats flashy gains. A solid strategy that delivers 20-30% a year can compound into a fortune over time. Meanwhile, the strategies promising crazy returns are often a one-way ticket to big losses. I know what you're thinking: 20-30% gains a year are shit and you are completely right, but that's what I have found out when backtesting strategies based on technical analysis. I cannot speak for other strategies. But with the options we have nowadays (for example prop firms) 20-30% might still be enough to give you significant gains to live from.

At the end of the day, the backtesting tools taught me that it’s not just about finding a strategy that “works”—it’s about finding one that’s sustainable. There is no holy grail.",229,182,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1f91zzp/heres_what_i_learned_from_backtesting_hundreds_of/,all,Discussion,0.9

1jiyl99,2025-03-24,2025-03-24 14:54:15,Here’s what I realised watching my students trade,"Hi, 

To give some context - I’m a trader and I teach people on the side and help traders become profitable. At least that’s what I thought until I watched my students trade their accounts to get more into depth of what’s working out and what’s not working out and here’s what I found - 

Analysis - after a lot of work and studying and practice most students were able to get an easy grasp of the market and start trading following what I tell them - they start gaining profits the first few days. 

Trading - but here’s the reality check - if they end up losing a trade (happens in every single strategy / trader due to market conditions) they are not able to take it. 

What do they do? 

1. Over leverage to get back 
2. Start being greedy to get more trades because they KNOW the strategy works and can make money 
3. End up taking low quality trades without analysing 
4. Get fearful to enter good trades so they exit before it can perform 
5. Then take bad trades again 
6. This loop continues to repeat. 

Little did I know that no matter how much I can teach them about the markets - they can never make money because of “losses”. They just can’t get over it. That’s just one thing. 

There are traders with a gambling mindset - they just are like “f*** it” let’s see what happens. Never works. And the other thing? Oh I’m just a good person why does the market continue to treat me bad and it’s brutal when I put so much effort into it? 

Think about this for a minute - if the market started “caring” for you will it even be a market for everyone? 

I can firmly say one thing about trading with experience teaching, how I got profitable, watching traders struggle and my own struggles - losses. If you can’t embrace, accept, enjoy, love it, or just be ok with it - truly from how you feel about it and think about it - no matter how amazing you are as an analyst in the market - there is always a chance of you losing all your money in the markets. 

This is just the tip of the iceberg - there’s also insane greed when it comes to risk management and fearful SLs and “giving it breathing space” SL. Like literally anything and everything to convey yourself to make money when the market follows its own damn rules!!! 

There is an insane amount of real psychological work that’s required to become a profitable trader and that’s something no one talks about. This is why even the smartest people you’d know will lose money in the markets and they just call it a gambler’s space. No. It requires you to see money as a resource and nothing else. Very few can achieve that and market teaches you that - people just choose to ignore that fact and try harder to make money when your own mind turns on you again and again.

1ihnxr8,2025-02-04,2025-02-04 13:01:14,now i understand why 99% of traders don't make it,"it's just too difficult to trade profitably on a long term basis lol

it's difficult mentally, conceptually, and in terms of execution

just way too much demand placed on the average person

most people that get into trading probably don't even want to study something like wyckoff methodology or read any book on trading

they want to just jump right in and do something stupid, like buy when price crosses a moving average, or sell when there is a big red candle

that's what 99% of people want to do lol

only like 1% would bother even reading the books and studying

and on top of that, there's still the psychological and risk management compontent that also needs to be on point

and above all, a decent IQ level is needed to actually trade in real time and make decisions. to be able to understand the market and adapt when things don't go your way. allowing you to hold onto your profits and cut losses early

that takes a tremedous amount of skill, understanding, and IQ. ESPCIALLY if one wants to do that over a long period of time and for a living as a full time job. it's extremely difficult

I want to share something that is blowing my mind. I literally bought 2 mutli thousand dollar courses and both of them suck compared to the one I want to share with you that you can find for free on youtube. First, I think everyone that is still struggling with finding an edge should look into volume profile, market profile and orderflow. These concepts provide an insane amount of value and if I could start my trading career over I would learn these concepts. I found my edge with price action and fundamental/news analysis but I know enough traders like Andrea Cimi. Fabio Valentini, Jan Smolen and Patrick Nill that kill the market with these concepts. So a while ago in this subreddit someone suggested this course to someone else and since then I've watched most of the videos and I've never seen a better course that is more indepth and complete like this one. The guy that made it is called ""The flow Horse"". You can find the whole course here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW-zja9ufsdjEntkQNd0Y9ZqU503M9Xm\_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW-zja9ufsdjEntkQNd0Y9ZqU503M9Xm_)

Since a lot of BS is shared in this community I think some good information is needed as a contrast. And this course is probably one of the best out there and it is free what is insane to me.

1is0nzp,2025-02-17,2025-02-17 20:19:58,The 5 Biggest Changes That Made Me Profitable,"
For a long time, I couldn’t stay consistent in trading. I had the knowledge, the setups, and the technicals but I kept losing money because of my own bad habits.

After making these 5 major changes, my trading completely transformed:

1️⃣ No Trading Before 9:45 AM – Here’s Why

I used to jump into trades as soon as the market opened—and I kept getting slapped. Then I realized:
-Pre-9:45 is a trap – Impatient traders get in too early, and market makers exploit them.
-Stop hunts and fake moves – Price loves to manipulate early traders before making the real move.
- Now I wait – I don’t even think about pressing buy or sell before 9:45 AM. Instead, I watch how price reacts and set up for high-probability trades.

2️⃣ I Only Take 2 Trades Per Session (Win or Lose, That’s It)

I used to fire off 20+ trades a day, chasing every little move. The result? More losses, more stress, and overexposure to the market.
-Now I have 2 bullets per session.
- If I lose both, I’m done—no revenge trading, no forcing.
-This forces me to wait for the best setups instead of taking low-quality trades.

3️⃣ Less Is More – I Went from 20+ Trades a Day to 2-3 Trades a Week

Before, I was trading every single day, taking 17-20 trades daily. But then I realized:
- More trades = More exposure = More risk
- Overtrading = More chances to make emotional mistakes
-Now I only trade 2-3 times a week, waiting for perfect setups. My results? Way higher win rate, less stress, and more control.

4️⃣ Be Careful What You Consume on Social Media

I used to scroll through Twitter, YouTube, and Discord, seeing traders post huge $30K+ wins. It gave me the illusion that I should be making big money every day.
- Social media warps reality. Most people don’t show their losses.
-Following random trades = No edge. You need your own system.
- I started filtering what I watch and only focus on content that actually helps me grow.

5️⃣ Fitness & Diet – How It Affects Trading

This was a game changer. How can you expect to be precise in trading when:
- You’re always tired from bad sleep.
- Your blood pressure is high from a bad diet.
- You can’t focus because you never exercise.

- I started working out, eating clean, and following a structured routine.
-My mind is clear, focused, and sharp.
- My discipline in fitness carried over into my trading.

1k7od95,2025-04-25,2025-04-25 11:53:19,Trading is Like a Drug. Here's My 3-Year Journey Fighting It,"In my years doing trading, I’ve realized:  
**Trading is like a drug.**

In my first year and a half, I was an addict.

* Always glued to the charts.
* Always checking my phone.
* Trading 10 different forex pairs and stocks.
* Always wanting to be “in the market”—even late at night.
* Revenge trading, overtrading, blowing accounts.

Of course... I lost a lot of money.

Then came the second phase:  
I tried to clean it up.

* I narrowed down to just 3 pairs.
* I only traded during specific hours. But even then—revenge trades still slipped in. Overtrading still happened. I learned a lot—but I was still leaking money.

And now, finally, this last year:

* I only trade **one instrument.**
* I journal **everything**—money results **and** emotional results—every single day.
* I have a real **trading plan**.
* I know **exactly** when to enter and exit.
* My strategy is **clear and repeatable**.

And guess what?  
I’m finally consistently profitable—**and growing** every month.

Are there still emotional slips sometimes? Yes.  
But they’re rare now—and nowhere near the chaos I lived in before.

If you’re new to this: **Trading will ruin your life if you can’t control your emotions.**  
But if you tame it—if you respect the discipline—  
It becomes the closest thing to a money-printing machine you’ll ever have.

Stay strong. Stay clean.  
Trade like a professional—not an addict.",203,53,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1k7od95/trading_is_like_a_drug_heres_my_3year_journey/,all,Advice,1.0
1nemd8q,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 18:19:41,"Trading humbled me, it forced me to rebuild my discipline in every area of life","When I first got into trading, I thought it would be easy money. I was wrong. I lost a lot, and for a while I believed the people telling me I’d never make it.

But instead of quitting, I treated it as a career and realized trading was bigger than charts. It humbled me and forced me to rebuild discipline in every area of life: gym, diet, faith, mindset, sleep, habits. Without those, I couldn’t stay consistent on the charts.

Now, I’m not rich, and I don’t pretend to be a guru. But I’ve had a few payouts already, and more importantly, I’ve proven to myself that consistency outside trading directly impacts results inside trading.

I’m planning to start documenting this journey publicly. Not signals, not “get rich quick,” just the real process of building discipline, faith, and trading together.

1le61kx,2025-06-17,2025-06-17 22:36:02,"After 8 years and countless blown up accounts, some advice for people who keep losing","When I started trading Bitcoin futures 8 years ago, I thought the goal was to find the magic indicator, the holy grail that would call tops and bottoms. I spent many years bouncing between MACD, RSI, Fibonacci, moving averages, trying to make sense of it all. At one point, my chart looked like a colorful disaster. The more indicators I stacked, the more confused I became.

Eventually, I wiped enough accounts to realize it wasn’t about indicators. It was about understanding how price moves. I don’t mean patterns like flags and triangles I mean real movement, real intent. Why did price explode from this level? Why did it reject from that one? Who’s on the other side of the trade, and what are they trying to do?

The two biggest concepts that shifted how I trade were Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) and Order Blocks. Once I started noticing how often price would shoot up or drop down aggressively and then later come back to fill inthat area, it started to click. Price isn’t random it’s cleaning up its mess. I started focusing less on chasing and more on waiting for price to return to those areas. Just being patient and letting the chart breathe changed everything.

Same with Order Blocks when you learn to identify the real ones (the ones that cause breaks of structure), it’s like unlocking a map. You start seeing where the smart money is probably entering. You stop blindly entering mid-range and start positioning around where decisions are made.

Supply and demand was another one. Sounds basic, but when you really understand it, it’s all you need. Why does price react so violently to certain levels? Why do consolidations explode and come back later? It’s not a coincidence. Price is doing what it’s supposed to do it’s just that most people don’t wait long enough to see it.

The hardest part of trading wasn’t learning strategy. It was learning patience. Emotional control. Risk management. I had blown up more than 40-50 accounts in the first few years already. My savings went to 0. I almost became homeless and had dark negative thoughts about myself. I used to curse myself for ever getting involved into something like this where 90% of the population end up losing everything they own.

My family supported me during that time and i remember how tough that spot was. I would never wish something like that even on my worst enemy. 

I’m sharing this because I know a lot of people are getting into trading hoping to flip a small account overnight. I’ve been there.  we all want freedom, fast. But trading isn’t fast. It’s a skill, and it rewards patience more than speed.

If you’re in the early stages just focus on market structure, FVGs, OBs, and risk. You don’t need more indicators. You need time, and a method that you can stick with. That’s really it.

i have seen many people end up becoming homeless because of trading. Please do not be one of them. Do everything you can to find the right way to trade or if you can't do it then be honest with yourself drop it completely. It really is a brutal zero sum game. 

Hope this helps someone.

EDIT : Just posted a video on this subreddit where i explain today's btc trade in a step by step fashion. I ended up closing it early but it went to my tp an hour later lol. Waiting for the mods to approve the post. Hope it helps out some people as i would never wish the negative consequences of trading on even my worst enemies.

Waited for only A+ setups. Forced myself to sit on my hands until it was obvious.

Made peace with missing moves. FOMO will make you broke faster than anything else.

Pre-marked all key levels before the open and reviewed everything inside TradeZella after the session.

Traded only during my best hours. No random late-day trades just because I was bored.

Cut trades fast when they invalidated. No hoping, no praying, just execution.

Focused on quality over quantity. One good trade > five mediocre ones every time.

Treated cash as a position. No trade is better than a bad trade.

1nmx0to,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 12:50:01,5 Years In: The Advice I Wish Someone Gave Me On Day One,"I’ve been trading full-time for  2 years, started trading 5 years ago. Along the way, I’ve blown accounts, passed and lost prop firm challenges, had incredible months, and then been humbled the very next week. I primarily trade futures and stocks, but these lessons apply no matter what market you’re in.



1) Fewer Trades, Better Trades

My worst periods came from feeling like I needed to be in the market constantly. The reality is that most price action is just noise, or at least noise to YOU. The edge shows up only a handful of times each week. My best months came from taking fewer than 20 trades and letting the rest pass.



2) Keep Your Playbook Simple

When I started, my charts looked like Times Square, indicators stacked everywhere. That only led to hesitation and confusion. What finally worked was cutting it all down to a short, boring playbook: clean levels, liquidity cues, structure, and a couple of repeatable entries. Same markets, same times, same setups. Very very boring, which is good in the markets.



3) Risk First, Always

Every account I destroyed had the same cause: I ignored risk and moved stops, oversized or tried to “let it work.” Now I define my maximum loss per trade and per day. I place my stop where the trade is invalid and respect it. Capital is ammunition, you only get so much. Don’t waste it trying to prove you’re right. Also one of the reasons I could not make it in options trading is because yyou just never know the exact amount you can make.



4) Journaling Is Where Growth Happens

I used to think bad days were random. Journaling proved otherwise. When I started logging my trades with context, entry, exit, and emotions, patterns became obvious. I was revenge trading after losses, taking boredom trades late in the morning, and cutting winners during news. Writing it down forced me to face the truth and improve. I started with manual journaling but then moved to software years later because when you just write down stuff in your notebook, its really hard for the stats or the lessons you need to see to be availble to you quickly.



5) Protect Your Headspace

Trading money you can’t afford to lose is a fast way to ruin both your account and your mental health. If your rent or grocery money is on the line, you will cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and chase bad setups. Trade small, separate trading capital from living expenses, and make sure red days don’t control your mood for 24 hours.



6) Screen Time Beats Guru Time

Videos and books can teach you the basics, but real progress comes from watching price move in real time, replaying sessions, and backtesting your setups. Intuition isn’t luck, it’s thousands of hours of screen time.



7) Base Hits Beat Home Runs

Chasing the one big trade is what ruined me early on. Consistency is what built my account. A steady $200-300 a day compounds into far more than swinging for $5K and blowing up when you’re wrong. The small, repeatable wins are what keep you in the game long enough to scale. I started with making $20-40 a day or a trade I should say, and slowly sizing up, then gaining more capital and copy tading these smaller trades accross plenty accounts.



Bottom Line

Trading isn’t about finding a secret strategy. It’s about building a clear playbook, respecting risk, journaling your execution, and protecting your mindset. Once you do those things consistently, confidence stops being a feeling and becomes a fact backed by your data.



I’d like to continue doing write-ups like this if it helps the community. For my next post, I can go deeper into:



A) My exact journaling and review workflow (what I log, how I review, and how it’s helped me improve)

B) An autopsy of my first year, the 10 biggest mistakes I made and how I fixed each one

1. **Don't trade when you're angry, emotional, tired, or distracted.** Seriously, this is a recipe for disaster. Your best decisions come from a clear head.
2. **Don't risk more than 2% of your account per trade.** Protect your capital above all else. A string of small losses is recoverable; a few big ones can be devastating.
3. **Always have your stop-loss decided (and ideally set) before you enter a trade.** Know your exit before you even think about your entry. No exceptions.
4. **Walk away when the market is choppy or unclear.** You don't have to trade every day. Sometimes, the best trade is no trade at all. Patience pays.
5. **Test your strategy in fantasy trading (or demo) first, and thoroughly.** Don't commit real capital until you have some statistical edge and confidence.
6. **Trading is 80% waiting, 20% execution. Get good at both.** The patience to wait for your setup is just as crucial as the discipline to pull the trigger correctly.
7. **Do NOT revenge trade.** Ever. Chasing losses only leads to bigger losses. Step away, cool off, and come back another day.
8. **Track your win rate, risk-reward, & holding time diligently.** If you're not tracking, you're guessing. Data helps you refine and improve.",186,38,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1mf5dw1/my_top_8_trading_rules/,all,Advice,0.98
1m6g543,2025-07-22,2025-07-22 10:50:49,How to start day trading for beginners ( Real Truth ),"Hello everyone. I have been trading for the past 8.5 years now and I've been profitable since the past 1.5 yrs now. 

been seeing alot of beginner posts here so let’s talk about something real for a second.


I'm going to share one of my personal live story with you guys as a lesson. 

I started playing chess 2 yrs ago and i got stuck at 900 elo ( yes it's laughable but it's the best i coudl do ) for many many months almost a year. Until i realized there's no freaking point in playing countless games i need to learn and gain more knowledge. Yes i did try YouTube but it wasn't working much for me. I would do well and then fall back down. So i found a guy who lived near me and played chess, i decided to ask him what his rating was, he was a 1400 rated chess player. I asked him to teach me how he plays chess. He wasn't a great teacher but watching him play and just playing together with him helped me and i broke the 1000 rating barrier and reached 1380 ( my maximum yet) in just a few months. In less than half the amount of time that i spent playing by myself being stuck at 900 only. 

In every part of life, we learn from others.

You learn how to walk, talk, and eat from your parents.
You learn math and writing from your teachers.
You learn your first job from senior coworkers or mentors.

So why do people treat trading like it’s any different?

This is the only field where people think they can jump in, risk real money, and somehow figure it out alone… for free… with no guidance…like it's a walk in the park. Brother this is psychological warfare. 

And then they wonder why they lose.

Let me be very clear.
The no.1 reason 99% of people fail in trading is because they try to do it without a mentor. Yes i know there are many scammers out there but I'm being dead serious. It's your job to find out who's legit or not. 

Don't go to a YouTube guru Especially TJR. He's a clown who's trades like an intermediate level trader at best. 

I’m talking about someone real.
Someone who can sit with you, walk you through real trades, call you out on your mistakes, and actually teach.

I didn’t have that. I had to figure it all out on my own and i paid for it in time. 
It took me 8 years painful years. Had i found a mentor for myself i would have been profitable in under a year max. I did look around but i couldn't pay $2k - 3$k for mentorships. So i kept grinding countless hours of my life watching the screen. Had i found someone for under $300 i would have taken it in a heartbeat. Money is not the most important thing. Time is. 

If you want to do it solo? Be my guest.
But don’t expect to get it in a few months. You never will.
And don’t assume just because you’ve been trading for years that you're getting better.
I know people who’ve been trading for 10 to 15 years and still can’t make money.
Time alone means nothing in this game.

My biggest mistake was letting ego lead the way.
I thought I was smart enough to crack the code without help. I have done some deep introspection of myself over the years thanks to trading. I have realized i needed to lose my ego completely and learn from anyone who was better than me st getting results in anything that I'm interested in. Be it chess or anything else.

The market humbled me again and again until i lost my ego completely.


This is how real life works. Yes i know you all want to be independent and financially free from everything but the process of getting there requires you to be dependent on others. Atleast im the beginning if you want to save years of your life. 


drop the ego and learn from someone who’s already profitable.

There are a few traders out there who actually teach what works if you look hard enough.

I wish you all the best.

While a bearish bias is certainly warranted in the medium and long term, volatility is out of control and movements in either direction are going to be extreme regardless of overall direction. This is not your typical market that's moving off of the usual shenanigans (stop-hunts, shakeouts; wide ranges), this is a market where even the largest players are in a ""sink or swim"" mentality on a mission to not get torched by one another.

What we are about to witness is bloodshed between the largest players as they cut at each other's neck to close previous positions at optimal pricing and set themselves up for the next leg of the trip. Your job early in the week is to be patient and not get gutted. If you're loaded on calls/bullish, take profit on half your lot, trail the rest, and exit where you may... Unfortunately, puts/bears seem like they're going to get cooked early.

The mid-day squeeze is what sets the stage as the ""unsettled auction"" between 5086.50 & 5277.25 on 04/09 was settled the following day when pricing revisited and rebounded from this area; marking the end of the early session sell-off to KSL 5149.50. 



On Friday (04/11), we see pricing reject a revisitation to this area in the early session as pricing stayed tight and big money kept things in check/consolidated; providing confirmation of the key resistance-level (KRL) @ 5280.50 set on Monday (04/07) as new-found support; which was previously confirmed as a key price-level on Tuesday as prices rejected from this level for a second time out of the open. 

  
What does all of that mean? It means that the previous area of price instability (the previous unsettled auction) was explored and settled back to the upside; indicating no further transactions were sought in this region by larger players. For all intents and purposes, continuation to the downside now rests on pricing plunging through the key levels at KRL 5280.50 (and subsequently KSL 5149.50). Should a convincing breach of 5280.50 be made, KSL 5149.50 gets burned and we dive (which I don't find very likely given news and without discovering new price to the upside).

  
So we look above:

https://preview.redd.it/n7vk3a96qjue1.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=62cdb25fdc44b7077d8048f896dd9b98b6c4e04e

Here lies a very nasty trap: as pricing seeks to test KRL 5528.50 it will be inevitably ran through on recent news. The no-man's land that is 5528.50 thru 5771.75 is going to get bulls torched once the top sets in for what will be a violent drop headed straight back toward KRL 5280.50. Both KRL 5528.50 and KRL 5771.75 beg for a retest, and both coincide with the pricing discrepancies formed by the gap between 04/02's close and 04/03's open. 

  
Once in lala land, long positions opened on 04/09, 04/10, and 04/11 will be taking profits and consolidating short. Anyone who shorted back in JAN will also be profit taking, waiting on news, then loading short again. Any calls placed toward the top of this region are SMOKED and the squeeze down will be as glorious as the one we witnessed in Wednesday's afternoon session. When pricing arrives here, DO NOT BUY THE NEWS. 5650.00 should be target to TP for anyone on the right side of this move. 



# To Recap:

KRL 5280.50 is a key support level with two significant confirmations. If it is breached at all, KSL 5149.50 should be tested with a rapid retracement before a continuation to the downside. This is unlikely to happen before testing key levels to the upside for various reasons. Therefore, sights should also be set at KRL 5528.50; which, given price action, is not a very convincing resistance level. Should KRL 5528.50 be tested, it is likely blown through and quickly retraced on a retest as support before rapid continuation; as pricing lacks discovery between KRL 5528.50 and KRL 5771.75. 



Given that large players will be in a dance of taking profits on short positions from the ATH, closing red on shorts made 04/09-04/11, and then taking profits on long positions established 04/09-04/11— and given that retail investors will be FOMO'ing in on any bullish news— pricing likely arrives to ≈ 5700.00 in short order before becoming choppy and ultimately failing to retest 5771.75 in a tight consolidation and swift move back to the downside; as such a level (5771.75) is so obvious for retest that everyone in this community (and the degens on Wall St.) will be itching to go long and pull the trigger on calls as soon as we hit 5700.00.

1iozk5p,2025-02-13,2025-02-13 20:48:24,Finding an edge is crazy hard,"I am trying to become a profitable trader for about 4 years now. I've had my moments of success and I am on a very good path in my opinion but I want to adress something that has been misrepresented in this industry in my humble opinion. There are a ton of people here who claim that ""every strategy works, it's the trader who makes a strategy proftiable"" or ""strategy is about 10-20% of the game, the rest is psychology"". And from my experience it's just wrong. Yeah trading psychology is hard and I believe a lot of people have to reprogramme their minds to become profitable and that is a rough journey. But finding an edge, a profitable strategy is at least as hard as psychology. I've looked into, backtested and worked with various strategies from ICT, Supply and Demand, breakout systems, trend following systems, time based systems and a lot more and what I've found is that nearly nothing works. The 2 strategies I've build that work for me right now I had to build myself and it took a lot of work, experience and knowledge to build these.  I see so many people saying that their problem is psychology, so that means that they already solved the puzzle of finding or building a profitable strategy and from my experience I simply don't believe them. You all understand that banks and hedge funds hire high class mathematicians, physicists and economists to build their strategies and you from the basement of your parents built a working strategy after 1-2 years studying Youtube-BS. I had to do crazy brain gymnastics to find the 2 edges I have right now. I sacrificed 3 and 4 years in front of the charts to build my 2 strategies and one of them only works with high probabilites under certain conditions. And both of these edges I found myself backtesting concepts and ideas, not from youtube or a course. Here is my claim: Most failing traders don't fail because of psychology but because they don't have a real edge. Most people copy strategies from courses and from Youtube/social media and I belive over 99% of these strategies don't work, at least from my experience ( and I paid a ton of money for courses). And if they somewhat work you still have to gain experience with them and adjust them to your experiences and your personality. Trading psychology is a great topic for scammers because they can ramble for hours without saying much and nobody is able to prove that they are just rambling. My journey of me finding an edge teached me how hard it is to find a real and also sustainable edge and I think the trading education industry is painting a wrong picture of trading that is crazy harmful for beginners. And I believe a lot of people out there who believe that they have a problem with psychology actually have a problem with their strategy because it is bad and it doesn't guide them to good setups through precise and clear rules. If you don't know what you are doing you become emotional. What was a big switch in my trading career was learning how it feels to trade a strategy that you have a 100% trust in because you know there is an edge behind it and you've gained the experience with it that gives you the confidence you need. A good strategy and experience with it leads to good psychology. Before you build your psychology you have to nail the strategy part. And that one is much harder that the industry is trying to portray it. 

Can anybody relate to this? Or do you think I am wrong? I am open for a discussion because this is something I am thinking about for years now.

1l4s2vj,2025-06-06,2025-06-06 09:13:04,Why Most Traders Fail: They’re Trading in the Wrong Timeframe,"If your entries feel random or your trades keep stopping out, it’s probably not your strategy, it’s your TF alignment.

Here’s how to fix it:

**Use a Higher Timeframe (HTF) for bias.**  
That’s where you read market structure, sentiment, liquidity zones, and major levels.

**Use a Lower Timeframe (LTF) for execution.**  
That’s where you time your entry, manage risk, and look for precision.

The two must be aligned.  
Bias without precision leads to missed trades.  
Precision without bias leads to random trades.

Here’s a framework that works:

* Monthly → 1H entries
* Weekly → 15M entries
* Daily → 5M entries
* 4H → 1M entries

Stop flipping between timeframes with no purpose. Know your context and trigger.  
Align them both, and your edge sharpens fast. Journal and track everything to get to know yourself and to understand what style of trading fits you best.

I have also traded for a few years on my own while working and studying and I can safely say that trading is hard. The majority of our clients lose all their money and cannot trade even if their life dependent on it.

I have reached to the conclusion that even if a retail successful does exist, they are simply an outlier. Combination of leverage and spreads is dooming. The only way to beat the market from what I have seen is that you need to find a true edge. 

The edge needs to go beyond charts and single instruments. It can either be a combination of instruments or brokers.

On the other hand, I would advise that you stop trading and invest. The difference is that the second one is not looking for a quick buck but simply trusting the process that markets will go up as a whole in the future. You do not have to cherry pick stocks or any other instruments. Simply invest in cheap ETFs.

1fajy3e,2024-09-06,2024-09-06 12:49:16,Remember...A Few Days Per Month is All You Need,"A common theme with newer traders I work with is the desire to always be in a trade.

However, what most new traders learn is that when you are always in a trade it is nearly impossible to get beyond the break even stage of trading (or worse).

A lot of people are sold on the idea of base hits ""every day."" Or a magical 1% per day from their favorite furu.

For those of you struggling, a good rule of thumb to remember is that you don't need a base hit every single day. You just need a few good days per month and to preserve capital the rest of the time. 

If you shift your perspective to this mentality, you will be surprised at the gains in your account.

For me, I focus on nailing a couple of extended runs (trend days) per week. I'd rather have 1-2 days where I can pull in larger profit than try and land 1% or a base hit per day. 

Why?

A 1% goal or base hit per day sounds great...but...having a ""daily"" goal will cause me to force trades. It will also cause you to take profit too early and miss larger moves because you got your base hit (hard to have a good profit factor if your winners don't outsize your losers because you hit your daily goal and quit).

Think of it this way: you don't need to make 1% per day to average 1% per day over the long run.

You just need a few really good days per month. To recognize those good days and to ride them.

If you can max profits on those days and preserve capital the rest of the time, your account will grow far more than trying to land a perfect trade every day.

2: I am not a ""coach"", advisor, teacher so dont DM me.

  
I've been trading for about 5 years and am ""more-or less"" profitable. Basically, 2024 ended in the very light green. (S&p 500 would have been way better return) and 2025 is starting off well.

What i discovered, for me, is the biggest thing, is the psychology.

I dont have a real ""edge"". i trade stupid simple. I avoid big news, i avoid 2H before NY closing, and 30 minutes before and after open. I avoid fridays (dont know why yet, but cant make money on fridays) ...Other then that, i simply scalp session trend following bounces. 

My biggest 2 ""OMG"" moments... 1: The more i keep it simple, the better i perform and 2: I am my worst enemy.. and heres the advice

I trade FOREX and i recently discovered that my biggest ennemy is myself.. FOMO and revenge trading so i added a new rule and its been helping me.

Basically, i follow 3 pairs but only trade 1 actively. if my trade wins ""normal range"", i stay in that pair. If my trade wins BIG or loosses, i switch pairs. And heres the WHY. This forces me to ""blank slate"". i cannot revenge trade because i have to re-analyse breaking my possibilities to FOMO or revenge.

1grtydz,2024-11-15,2024-11-15 06:06:32,Traders who are looking to learn ,"Hi again, 

I conduct zoom workshops for beginner and intermediate traders who are looking to learn technical analysis. Have conducted over a dozen of them in this sub and it helps almost everyone who joins it. 

I teach pure price action, key levels and have developed strategies to trade the markets based on that. Once you understand price action and how key levels work alongside price action - it’s easy to develop profitable strategies but it requires a lot of practice to trade them and spot them in live markets. 

Anyone who’s going through a rough phase, confused phase or losing streaks or even break even phases can join and maybe learn a thing or two. All questions are welcome in the zoom session. 

I do this group session for free. I don’t charge for this. It’s solely to explain markets to traders and looking to benefit from an experienced analyst and trader. I’ve got over 6 years of experience to share and I’m a full time profitable trader. Keep in mind - that joining my session isn’t going to make you profitable immediately- I’m only going to show you the market for what it is so you can get a very good understanding of it. That is all. Once you’ve learned the factors involved in the market - it’s repetitive, deliberate practice that is going to make you first a really good analyst and then a good consistently profitable trader. Of course there’s also psychology involved as I know that trading is 100% psychology and technical analysis is the start. 

Interested people can comment below and I’ll add you to the group session I’ll be organising coming Sunday.

1nqij5e,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 17:01:37,"What Losing $72,000 Taught Me About Trading","

I don’t post this to flex or to get sympathy. I’m posting this because every trader at some point hits a wall, and for me that wall cost $72,117. Looking back at those trades, I learned more from that drawdown than from any winning streak I’ve ever had. If you’re in this game, I hope what I share here saves you time, money, and a few blown accounts.

1. Risk management isn’t a suggestion
When I dug into those losses, the biggest mistake wasn’t the setups themselves. It was that I had no consistent risk plan. Sometimes I’d risk $200, sometimes $2,000, depending on how “confident” I felt. Confidence is not risk management. Without a fixed risk per trade, every loss compounds unpredictably. The number that stood out most to me wasn’t the -$72K. It was the 13 consecutive losses. With proper risk sizing, that stretch should have been frustrating, not account-ending.

2. Losing streaks reveal the truth about your process.
It’s easy to feel like a genius when trades are going your way. You start to believe the market “makes sense” and you’ve got it figured out. A real losing streak exposes whether you have an actual system or if you’re just winging it. During those 13 red trades in a row, I realized I didn’t have a defined playbook. I had “ideas” and “feelings”  but nothing I could consistently execute. If you can’t clearly write down your setup, your entry/exit criteria, and your risk rules, you don’t have a strategy. You have hope.

3. The psychological spiral is real.
After a string of red trades, my instinct was to “make it back.” That’s when I started oversizing, taking lower-quality setups, and ignoring my stops. Every losing trader knows this spiral, but very few actually put systems in place to stop it. What I should have done was step away after 3 losses, reset, and review. Instead, I traded through it and bled out. Discipline isn’t about avoiding emotions, it’s about building rules that protect you from yourself when those emotions hit.

4. Journaling turns pain into progress.
The $72K wasn’t wasted because I documented every single one of those trades. I tracked context, entries, exits, and what was going through my head. Patterns became obvious: I was most reckless after 10:30 AM, I entered early instead of waiting for confirmation, and I risked more after a loss. Without journaling, I would’ve walked away with nothing but regret. With it, I built the foundation of my current process.

Losing money doesn’t make you a bad trader. Refusing to learn from it does. If you’re new, don’t wait until you’re $72,000 down to respect risk, build a playbook, and journal your execution. If you’ve already taken big losses, don’t waste them  extract every lesson you can and let the data, not your emotions, shape your next chapter.",175,46,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nqij5e/what_losing_72000_taught_me_about_trading/,all,Due-diligence,0.94

Once support breaks, they dump everything, triggering liquidations.

1gwemg8,2024-11-21,2024-11-21 07:01:16,I’m too dumb to be a trader ,"Not looking for any sympathy rather looking to rant here after coming to realisation that after 3 years of trading I am deciding to give up. 

I am generally just not smart/ emotionally smart enough to be a trader lol. I would say that to become a profitable trader, you need to be pretty clever as you are competing against the top qualified people everyday who will literally destroy you if you lack the emotional intelligence. 

I came to this realisation as I just kept repeating the same mistakes and never learned from them. An example would be that I would be in a perfectly good trade and then talk myself out of it almost every time, to then watch it work, chase it and lose money lol. Other things include using ridiculous stop losses that make no sense, being greedy and just making bizarre emotionally driven trades. In summary, I just would be in constant fear and overthink/ overanalyse everything to death instead of just doing it.

I wouldn’t even say I’m bad at reading the charts , my gut is actually correct more than 50% of the time so in theory I should be profitable but the emotional aspect I just couldn’t get over, it’s like when I went into the markets every day my brain would be in self sabotage mode.

Because of this I went through levels of severe depression, anxiety and it’s pretty much destroyed my relationships and health both mentally and physically which is really why I needed to quit - the dark side too it.

It hurts to quit but I think I needed a reality check after not making any money after three years. I think like most people I was drawn in by the fact you could make a good living working as an entrepreneur, but honestly and it hurts to admit it, I’m just not built to be an independent person, I need a boss or someone telling me what to do as I am pretty much incapable of making my own decisions and taking risks - a more structured lifestyle, maybe because I have been too conditioned through school etc.

I will quit trading and instead move to investing where you need to think about it much less rather than trying to guess the move every day as I’m just not built for the day trading lifestyle.

Also I already know I’m going to get some comments about ‘you are what you think’ etc but I genuinely think some people like myself need a reality check as it’s more of a personality thing",175,261,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1gwemg8/im_too_dumb_to_be_a_trader/,all,Discussion,0.98
l9g6xm,2021-01-31,2021-01-31 11:50:09,"Everyone's got guns, but do you have bullets? Well, here is some good ammo for you! Anatomy Of A Short Attack - This a repost of an older article but it will blow your mind because of how accurately it can be applied to today's situation with GME stock! Please read carefully!","Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

**Typical tactics include the following:**

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.

Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

**Media Assault -**

The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the *Wall Street Journal*, *Barrons*, the *New York Times*, Gannett Publications (*USA Today* and the *Arizona Republic*), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in *USA Today* during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven *USA Today* editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

>When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

[VIDEO IS RIGHT HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=dehurlock)

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.

**Analyst Reports -**

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

**Planting moles in target companies -**

The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

**Frivolous SEC investigations -**

The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

**Class Action lawsuits -**

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.

**Pulling margin from long customers -**

The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on [Pulling Margin](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html)).

**Paid bashers -**

The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for [Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS16ConfessionsOfAPaidStockBasher.html)).

***This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.***

**How Pervasive Is This?**

At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.

The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.

The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope.

1n4f7b9,2025-08-30,2025-08-30 19:03:07,My $86K Trading Journey,"Last year, I was a complete rookie trader and I was totally confused about how to get started. I began by watching free lessons on YouTube and listening to all of these experienced traders. They opened my eyes in a big way, but then I realized that I needed something more structured if I was going to take my trading to the next level.

At first, I was looking for those fancy trading courses on the internet but they were far beyond what I could afford :/. That was not a problem though, because I kept at it and picked up whatever I could from trading forums about market psychology, risk management, and technical configurations. After months of independent learning, I eventually decided to spend some money on courses in order to get serious about trading

I committed myself fully and promised that I would learn and practice every day. I focused on methods such as trend following, momentum trading, and smart position sizing. Within approximately three months, I began to see real gains. My confidence increased as my trades became more frequent and profitable.

Now, I am happy to say that I have made $86k through trading by using good education, effective risk management, and a great deal of patience. Trading is not simple or guaranteed guys, but if u r motivated enough and well prepared, it can definitely pay u back trust me!!

I do not usually spend much time on Reddit, but I just found this community and felt like sharing my journey.

Just crypto and long term dividend paying stocks. Recently, I've been going through a lot and working 60 hour weeks has left me with some extra cash so I've been getting into it pretty hard-core. Options especially. I love everything about watching the charts, analyzing and strategizing on how it might move, and then the excitement of watching it all unfold. I've found that in my quest of wanting to live a comfortable life where my money works for me, that also means losing people that have the 9-5 retire at 65 mindset. I'm hungry to surround myself with people that also have a bigger goal in mind instead of people that scoff at the idea of trading and potentially making 6 figures one day. I know a lot of people had to figure this out on their own and I was lucky enough to have a dad to talk basic stocks with, but never having any substantial conversations with people that seriously trade or even have an interest in it has been really bringing me down.

1m5suwd,2025-07-21,2025-07-21 15:44:08,Overtrading is the silent killer of your account.,"Nobody talks about how hard it is to just do nothing.

You think you’re working hard by taking 15 trades a day.  
You think you’re “grinding” by forcing setups that aren’t there.  
You think that more trades = more money.

But all you’re doing is bleeding out slowly.

Overtrading is usually you trying to force the market to pay you when it doesn’t owe you shit, when you're trying to avoid discomfort after a loss and just to feel “productive” because sitting on your hands feels like laziness.

I’ve watched profitable weeks turn into red weeks because I couldn’t sit still.  
I’ve watched a winning trade turn into a losing day because I “just wanted one more.”  
I’ve watched my mindset get destroyed because I was chasing dopamine, not discipline.

Trading isn’t about activity. It’s about **selectivity***.*

You don’t get paid for pressing buttons.  
You get paid for **waiting for the right moment***,* then executing without hesitation.

If you’re stuck in the cycle of overtrading, try this:

* Give yourself a **max trades per day rule** (I use 3). 
* Force yourself to walk away after a full loss. 
* Pre-plan your A+ setups and ignore everything else.

You don’t need to trade more. You need to trade **better***.*",167,86,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1m5suwd/overtrading_is_the_silent_killer_of_your_account/,all,Advice,0.98

1jv2vr8,2025-04-09,2025-04-09 06:54:11,8 years Later . What i have learnt !,"After 8 years in the markets, I want to share some hard-earned wisdom with those of you walking this path. The journey of a trader is unlike any other.

Trust your system, but question your emotions. The most profitable trades often feel uncomfortable, while the most comfortable ones can lead to disaster. I've learned this countless times, watching positions I loved turn against me while the ones that made me nervous delivered returns.

Consistency trumps perfection. The traders who survive aren't those who never lose—they're the ones who show up every day with discipline, following their rules even when it hurts. Your daily habits matter more than your biggest wins.

Protect your capital fiercely. No setup, no matter how compelling, deserves to risk your trading future. The ability to say ""I don't know"" and step aside is as valuable as any technical skill you'll develop.

Keep a trading journal. Your greatest teacher is your own experience, but only if you study it honestly. Review your decisions without judgment but with unwavering honesty.
The market doesn't care about your feelings, your bills, or your dreams. This isn't cruelty—it's neutrality. Once you stop expecting the market to validate you, you'll find freedom in trading what is, not what you wish would be.

Isolation kills traders. Find a community that challenges you, supports you, and speaks truth when you need to hear it. The market will humble all of us eventually—having people who understand that journey is invaluable.

Finally, remember that trading is a marathon. Eight years in, I'm still learning every day. The moment you think you've mastered the markets is precisely when they'll teach you otherwise.
Stay humble. Stay hungry. And most importantly, stay in the game.",158,53,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1jv2vr8/8_years_later_what_i_have_learnt/,all,Due-diligence,0.95
1m71s26,2025-07-23,2025-07-23 02:20:44,What I learned from teaching other traders,"Most of you got one thing right and one thing wrong. One works so well for you and the other doesn’t work at all and you haven’t exactly processed it right. 

I’ve taught about 80-100 traders so far I think (ballpark) one thing I’ve noticed is - all of you are hard workers, smart and quick thinking people. When I teach technical analysis I don’t find anyone messing it up - grasping the idea or concepts behind it or practicing it well and learning and honestly just working hard but in trading that’s not enough. In other areas of life, any other job, it’s enough and it’s exactly what you expect to do before making it work for you. But in trading the thing where most of you mess it up is the reason why you wanna trade. To make money. 

How you wanna make money always comes in between your skill of analysing the markets. I had the same issue too, the first 2-4 years of trading and you know when you’re so skilled in technicals that you realise at some point that you have to change something if you want your skill to even work? I worked and processed about how and why I feel the way I do about money and here are some hard truths I’ve learned: 

1. Money comes last in trades. 

You don’t come into the market to make money, you come into the market to sense what’s happening first. Analyse it well enough to see where you can find good trades and then only when you “know” that yes this is a solid trade then you “attach” money to it. 

2. Greed and fear takes control over you 

When you’re in a trade, the greed about money inside you, starts working. The fear in you starts working. The FOMO kicks in. The wanting more out of what this trade can actually give you starts working. 

3. Your emotional attachment to money reveals itself in the market.

It’s not visible when you’re studying charts or backtesting or learning from someone. But the second real money is on the line - your beliefs, fears, fantasies, and past experiences with money show up in full force. This is when trading stops being technical and becomes psychological. You’ll notice you start breaking your own rules, doubting your analysis, entering too early or too late, or refusing to exit. It’s not because you’re not skilled - it’s because your emotions have hijacked the process.

4. The inability to accept losses or be ok with it completely 

This is the most common and the hardest one for everyone I’ve taught, including me at a point. It’s so hard. Why? Loss is seen and felt as the worst thing in the world when it comes to money right? Who would want to make a loss? Why would I trade to make a loss and not profit? Cuz after all profits is why I’m even working hard. Wrong! Sure, it can work in other areas of business - the whole point is to just focus on profits and do anything and everything to minimise losses and avoid it at all costs. But in trading - what’s the easiest thing? Making a loss. Now, in anything that you as a person have done in life where you did it well - how? Cuz you enjoyed doing it. It’s only when we truly enjoy something we can even do it better and better - likewise in trading, the easiest thing is making a loss, not profit, obviously. So, if you don’t enjoy making a loss, you can never truly enjoy trading and if you don’t enjoy trading as a whole, you never really master it, and if you don’t master it? 

The only suggestion and the most important one to all aspiring traders is that process your relationship with money while you’re learning technicals. Don’t make the same mistake I did when I went full speed on learning technicals alone and letting technicals speak for my poor psych with money. Biggest mistake - learned later painfully but when I did process, my entire worldview changed. 

As you learn some factor in technicals and trade it - journal your emotion and thoughts and write up about it and ask yourself why you do that. Simultaneously. 

The difference between a profitable trader and a hardworking trader is this. If you don’t process your relationship with money and make it work for you, you’ll always be a hardworking trader and never fully attain your potential.

1llv2xp,2025-06-27,2025-06-27 10:19:19,The real truth about trading and trading educators,"Right so 45 yrs old here and been trading futures professionally since 2004 day in n out. I have gone local about a year now and when I am bored I read some forums mainly about trading especially here on Reddit. i have never posted anything over the internet cause sometimes you get into arguments and arguing over the internet its like arguing with a wall.

The only thing that I can agree with reading forums is that trading is extremely difficult. Especially on a CONSISTENT basis. Thats the key nothing else. If you are not consistent in this industry u will have a short journey.

Lets get something straight here. Real traders are secretive creatures and slightly weird by nature. Even if you are not you will most definitely become one. That being said there is not a single chance in this world they will reveal their strategy to anyone let alone go ahead and publish it. It is just common sense. And lets say that a ""Robin Hood"" goes bananas and decides to share their strat online and its a successful one. It will be short lived cause it will quickly get traction and the more people join the more difficult it will be to join that offer or bid. You will be seeing iceberg orders with people trying to do the same thing. And thats not even the worse part. If it is successful and people are able to join the strat (assuming that its public and the stop losses are on display) market makers will always chase the stop losses cause its effectively free money. I keep on saying to myself over the years that trading is constant search of stops anyways. So thats that.

Now the reason you see so many youtubers or educators revealing their strat is because it is not successful in the long run or its just stupid and its not worth the attention of the market makers. They make money either from views or by selling courses

""Those who cannot do teach"". Right let me tell you smth about that. I had some years especially between 2016-2020 where I just couldnt make it. Or I was just making peanuts. Had some colleagues that went the education route and started making tons of money, some even more than they were when they were trading. They were legit just retired from day trading for whatever reason. The only problem was that they were as well saying what people wanted to hear cause you know, money. If they were profitable they would still go on and trade, but we cannot exclude the fact that there are shit ton of money in that field with great demand and most people have mouths to feed. Nothing wrong with that as long as you are honest to your audience smth in terms like ""listen I used to be good I can tell you the right stuff but the journey is tough and u gotta own it"". Dont see many people doing that.

Right so that was the positive part and this is my subjective opinion about trading in general. No strategy works forever and the last 10 years some strats could be working for a few months and then you have to adjust it to the current market environment. Thats tough and that is why 95% of pro trading is done by algos. They have embedded systems that change strats before you can even blink your eyes. That is the challenge and the most interesting path to consistency. You keep on grinding and changing trying to keep up. Easier in the past more tough now but it is what it is. If you dont have a strategy that is adaptable you are toast period. And I will repeat trading is the mental effort to remain CONSISTENT. Big updays come through consistency, confidence and proper risk management the rest are just lucky punches. Baby steps as my first mentor used to say.

I have met thousands and worked with a lot of traders side by side especially before algos. If I had to give a brutal number out of 1000 people that are really interested in pursuing trading only 1 will be consistent in the long run. And I am not by any means saying that I was always consistent. I was not. But I never gave up and here we are.

1l13h5y,2025-06-01,2025-06-01 19:43:56,The Daily Habit That Separates Pros from Gamblers (From a 7-Figure Trader),"**This is what I learned from my mentor who is a 7-figure options/stock trader:**

He doesn’t just show up and trade. He prepares with intention, and logs every detail like a pro. He is an order flow trader with 8+ years of experience in the game and this is what I learned with my talk with him when he was mentoring me.



Every morning he starts with a full breakdown:





* **Key economic events**
* **Context for the open**
* **Previous day summary**
* **Pre-market behavior and price action**
* **Bullish and bearish scenarios based on levels**



Then comes the part that stuck with me the most:

**He writes a daily reminder to himself.**

Stuff like:

“Stick to your thesis. Focus on high RR locations. Don’t FOMO. Let the trades come to you.”

Those simple lines keep his mindset locked in all day. He also highlights 1–3 important stocks, outlines the trend, and sets key leves, inflection points, support, resistance, before the bell rings.

1hcmwek,2024-12-12,2024-12-12 09:59:23,Is Trading Really This “Simple”?,"When writing this, I intentionally avoided using the word “easy.” Trading is far from easy. Instead, I chose “simple” because, at its core, trading is just that—simple. You follow a set of rules, and if you adhere to them correctly, you’re rewarded more often than not. The simplicity lies in the structure of the rules, but the challenge is in mastering the psychology and discipline required to follow them. That’s what makes these “simple” rules anything but easy.

I’m a beginner, having been trading for just over six months. Most of what I’ve learned comes from ChatGPT and YouTube. I’ve never paid for a mentor. Instead, I used ChatGPT as my virtual mentor, asking personalized questions about trading and getting insightful responses.

I started with a demo account, practicing with €2,000—an amount I felt comfortable committing once I moved to live trading. My goal was €100 a day, enough to live comfortably.

I began my journey with SMC and ICT principles. The first strategy I tried was ICT’s Silver Bullet strategy. I spent countless hours watching every candle form on the 1-minute chart. For months, it felt like the strategy wasn’t working for me. Trades would often reach 2R or 3R, but I wouldn’t take profit because doing so went against the strategy and my stop loss would be hit. Eventually, I abandoned Silver Bullet. However, it wasn’t a waste of time. Through me being glued to my trades, I learned to observe the market deeply and understand how price moves.

After giving up on Silver Bullet, I went back to basics. I noticed how the market reacts to liquidity. I learned about internal and external liquidity, which fundamentally boils down to two principles: the market chases external liquidity, and once that liquidity is taken, it moves to fill internal imbalances. This realization was a game-changer. I now understood that fair value gaps (internal liquidity) and resting liquidity (external liquidity) were key to trading.

While researching fair value gaps, I stumbled upon inverse fair value gaps. Combining my knowledge, I developed a strategy built on three core principles: daily bias, inverse fair value gaps, and resting liquidity.

When I started using this strategy, I saw immediate success. Trade after trade was profitable. But then, I ran into a problem: I was overtrading. The high frequency of trades led to losses, despite my overall profitability. To reach my goal of €100 daily with a €2,000 account, I needed to make several trades. While my win rate was high, the small risk-to-reward ratio required frequent trades, which (while seeing success) wasn’t sustainable.

My solution came through funded accounts. With more capital, I could trade less and still hit my goals. For example, with a €10,000 funded account, I only needed one successful trade per day to achieve a 2% account growth—€200, which exceeded my daily target. This shift resolved all my issues: fewer trades, less overtrading, and reduced risk.

Now, over 6 months later, I feel confident. I have a solid strategy, a realistic daily goal, and a profitable system with manageable risks. But a lingering question remains: Am I missing something? Many traders emphasize the difficulty of trading, and as a beginner I wonder if I’m being lulled into a false sense of security. I’m scared to take this next step. Is trading really this “simple”?

Edit: I’ve noticed some people are focusing on the percentages I mentioned, so I’d like to clarify. When I was paper trading, I set a daily goal of €100, regardless of the account size. Looking back, I now realize that aiming for €100 daily on a €2,000 account was completely unrealistic. achieving 25% account growth in a week isn’t sustainable. At the time, I was ignorant and didn’t fully understand this.

The point I’m making is that reaching a €100 daily goal becomes far more achievable with a €10,000 account. For further clarification, I don’t grow my account by 2% every day. On average, each successful trade earns me around €200 (2% of the account). This means I only need 2–3 successful trades per week to consistently hit my daily goal.",151,146,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1hcmwek/is_trading_really_this_simple/,all,Discussion,0.93

But now that I’ve been doing it for a while, I’ve realized something:

**Most of trading is just… waiting.**  
Waiting for a setup. Waiting for the right time. Waiting for the market to stop doing nothing.

Then out of nowhere, you get like 5–10 minutes where everything moves fast, and you either follow your plan or you panic and mess it up.

Most new traders (including me at first) just chase dopamine. New indicators. New “strategies.” Jumping into trades just to feel something.

But the people who actually make it?

• Stick to a few solid rules  
• Don’t trade just to trade  
• Don’t let wins or losses mess with their head  
• Keep track of their trades and actually review them

It’s not flashy. It’s not always fun. But it works.

1l2bcr0,2025-06-03,2025-06-03 09:03:56,Truth about FUTURES Trading,"I’ve been trading futures for 4 years. Only in the last year have I become consistently profitable  and even then, consistency didn’t come from some magic setup. It came from discipline, risk control, and mastering my own mind.

Here’s what I’ve actually learned about futures after years of screen time, pain, trial, and refinement. No fluff. No hype.

1. It’s not a scam.

It’s a business. If you treat it like a slot machine, it’ll eat you alive. But if you approach it with structure, edge, and discipline, it works.

2. It’s not “fast money.”

It’s a slow mastery.

Futures reward structure, not speed. Forget the one big trade. Focus on 100 good ones.

Slow and Steady. I love the saying ""Live to trade another day""

3. You don’t need to predict. You need to react.

Most failed traders spend 90% of their effort trying to guess where the market will go. Successful traders prepare scenarios and respond with discipline.

4. Risk management isn’t optional.

If you don’t know your max daily loss, your stop-loss per trade, and your risk per setup, you’re gambling. Period.

5. **Prop firms are legit**… for the right trader.

Most people fail prop firms not because of the rules, but because they’re not ready. But for those with structure and discipline, it’s a great way to scale with limited capital. Just avoid the joke ones.

6. No strategy works without emotional control.

You could have the best model in the world, but tilt, greed, and FOMO will kill it every time. The edge is only real if it’s executed consistently.

7. Live trading is 100x different than demo.

Demo teaches mechanics. Live teaches you about yourself. You’re not a trader until you can handle pressure with real risk on the table.

8. Futures require focus.

Trading ES or NQ isn’t like clicking around on a forex broker app. Depth of market, order flow, news events, it’s a more technical game. You need intention.

9. 1–3R base hits > trying to catch the full move.

The people trying to get rich off one trade usually go broke chasing it. Good futures traders hit singles, manage risk, and stay in the game long enough for compounding to do the work.

10. The market humbles everyone.

Every time I got overconfident, it reminded me who’s in charge. But every time I stayed patient, selective, and disciplined, it rewarded me.

My current system is simple:

I trade failed breakdowns on ES with clear liquidity targets, confluence, and 1–3R expectations. I journal every trade inside Tradezella. I prep with a daily game plan. And most importantly, I don’t trade if the setup isn’t there.

If you’re struggling, just know that most people never make it because they want fast money, not sustainable progress. It’s not about being right. it’s about doing the right things every day until it pays off.

Don't give up. Refine your system. Log your data. Focus on the process.

1nm2lej,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 12:25:25,Here's a realistic breakdown of what it actually takes to become a consistent trader,"Ive noticed most people get into day trading because they see screenshots of $5k, $10k, $50k days and think it’s a quick path to freedom. I’ll be straight with you guys, that’s the marketing version of trading. Please don't buy into it. The reality is much less glamorous, and if you don’t know what it really takes, you’re going to burn out fast. After 5 years in this game, i wanted to do a little write up on my honest breakdown of what consistency actually looks like. This is Part 3 of my education series here, follow if you want more.

1. Time commitment is way more than you expect.

Trading isn’t just 9:30am to 4pm. Real consistency comes from hours outside market time: premarket prep, journaling, reviewing trades, building watchlists, studying setups, and putting in screen time. Early on, I easily spent 40 to 60 hours a week between live trading and studying. If you treat this like a hobby, you’ll get hobby-level results.

And it’s not just the hours, it’s the years. Consistency doesn’t come in 6 months, or even a year for most people. You’re rewiring how you think about money, risk, and decision-making under pressure. Expect it to take 2 or 3 years of real effort before you’re truly stable.

2. Risk management is non-negotiable.

I know everyone hears this, but most beginners still ignore it. Consistency doesn’t mean you never lose... it means your losses are small and controlled while your winners are slightly bigger. That balance, over hundreds of trades, is what keeps you profitable.

I don’t care if you’ve got the best setup in the world; if you’re risking half your account on one trade, you’re gambling. True consistency comes from risking small, living to fight another day, and never letting one trade or one day define you.

3. Discipline beats strategy.

Every new trader is obsessed with finding the “perfect” strategy. They’ll cycle through indicators, patterns, and systems, convinced the answer is out there somewhere. The truth? Most basic strategies work if you follow them with discipline. Most traders fail not because of their system, but because they don’t stick to it.

Consistency is boring. It’s showing up, following the same rules, and resisting the urge to deviate because of greed or fear. If you can’t execute a simple plan consistently, no “advanced” strategy will save you.

4. You need emotional resilience.

Day trading will mess with your head. You’re going to lose money. You’re going to question if you’re cut out for this. You’re going to watch your P/L swing in seconds and feel emotions you didn’t know you had. The people who survive aren’t the ones who avoid that... they’re the ones who learn to handle it.

Emotional resilience means not tying your identity to your results. It means accepting red days without revenge trading. It means staying calm when you’re up big and not blowing it all chasing more. Without that mental toughness, you’ll self-destruct.

5. You have to treat it like a business.

This isn’t a game. If you’re serious about consistency, you have to approach trading like running a business. That means budgeting your capital, keeping records, analyzing performance, and making adjustments based on data, not emotion. Your journal is your balance sheet. Your setups are your products. Your time and focus are your resources.

When you treat trading like a hobby, it costs you money. When you treat it like a business, it gives you structure and accountability. That shift in mindset is often the difference between gamblers and professionals.

**Bottom line**

Becoming a consistent trader isn’t flashy. It’s not about one big win, a secret indicator, or a magic system. It’s about boring, repetitive, disciplined work.. day after day, year after year. If you accept that reality, you’ll stop chasing shortcuts and actually give yourself a chance to make it.

1lrauc0,2025-07-04,2025-07-04 01:30:44,Thought Going Full-Time Would Fix Everything.,"I used to think going full-time would magically solve all my trading problems. That once I could sit at my desk all day, everything would click. But the reality was brutal. Full-time didn’t make me a better trader overnight, it just gave me more time to dig myself into deeper holes.

When I first started, I’d chase every candle that moved, convinced I was one trade away from success. I spent year one lost in noise, bouncing between YouTube strategies, stuffing my charts with indicators I didn’t even understand. It felt like everyone else had the secret, except me.

Year two gave me false hope. I learned smart money concepts, cleaned up my charts, and passed a couple prop firm challenges. But every time I got funded, I’d blow the account just as fast. Discipline wasn’t there. I kept blaming the market, the spreads, the news, anything but myself.

By year three, I quit my job thinking going full-time would force me to “make it.” But the truth was, the transition nearly broke me. The pressure was suffocating. I still relied on side gigs to pay bills because trading alone wasn’t consistent. I thought more screen time would mean faster success. Instead, it magnified every flaw in my process.

What changed wasn’t a new strategy. It was finally admitting the problem was me. I started journaling every entry, every exit, every emotion. Seeing exactly where I ignored stops, oversized, or chased gave me the clarity I needed. My edge wasn’t some secret indicator. It was the ability to execute my plan without self-sabotage. To this day I still have a stable side income and don't fully rely on trading and that really helped take the pressure off.

  
Learn to do new things, creative things and be useful.

Now, I trade with simple setups and focus on preserving capital, not forcing wins. I know it looks easy from the outside, but if you’re still grinding, don’t quit. The real turning point isn’t more hours on the charts. It’s learning to face yourself and fix what’s broken inside.

If you’re in the middle of this journey, I promise it can click. But it only does once you stop searching for shortcuts and start holding yourself accountable.

* He recently mentioned a “U.S. Crypto Reserve” with XRP, SOL, and ADA — those coins spiked.
* Another time, he posted *“THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!”* just hours before announcing a China tariff pause. Markets rallied hard.

Thing is, **these posts often hit before the market reacts**, but there’s no good way to catch them unless you’re doomscrolling Truth Social (which… isn’t ideal). It’s also not available outside the U.S., and most of his posts are just noise.

# So I’m building a simple alert app called Trumpet

It does 3 things:

1. Watches Trump’s Truth Social account
2. Uses AI to filter for *market-moving* posts only
3. Sends a fast push notification when one drops

I’m starting small — only Trump posts for now. Later, I want to add other signals like Fed announcements, political stock trades (Pelosi, etc.), or SEC news.

1noh5ve,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 09:18:13,The harsh truths nobody tells you about trading,"Most people come into day trading with dreams of financial freedom, working from a laptop, and making thousands before lunch time. And i honestly don’t blame them.. that’s how it’s sold online. But the reality of day trading is a lot harsher than what you see here from /r/wallstreetbets screenshots. For those who are serious about this, i wanted to list some of the truths most people won’t tell you until you’ve already lost a ton of money. This is part of an ongoing education series on reddit, if you like write ups like these, follow my account for more.

1. Most people lose money (and keep losing).

It’s estimated that 80 to 90% of traders fail, and that stat is no joke. The market is a zero-sum game; your wins come from someone else’s losses, and when you’re new, you’re the one feeding the experienced players. No strategy, guru, or indicator will change the fact that you’re paying tuition to the market in the beginning.

The hard part isn’t just learning setups..  it’s surviving long enough to actually get good. And the majority never make it past that stage because they run out of money or burn out mentally before they develop any consistency.

2. It takes years, not months, to get consistent.

A lot of beginners think they’ll be profitable within 6 months if they just grind hard enough. The truth is it usually takes 2 to 3 years of daily effort before you can really call yourself consistent. That’s thousands of hours of screen time, journaling, reviewing trades, and slowly building emotional resilience.

If that sounds like too much, trading probably isn’t for you. This is more like learning a professional craft (surgery, law, engineering) than picking up a side hustle. If you treat it like a shortcut, you’ll blow up.

3. Trading is boring when done right.

The highlight reels on social media show explosive wins and big green days. What you don’t see is that consistent trading is painfully repetitive. You’re taking the same setups over and over, cutting losers quickly, and stacking small wins.

If you’re looking for excitement, you’ll force trades, gamble on hype stocks, and churn your account into dust. The truth is the boring traders are the ones still around after 5 years.

4. Your emotions are your biggest enemy.

Everyone thinks they’ll be calm and logical until they watch their P/L swing hundreds or thousands in seconds. Fear makes you sell winners too early, greed makes you hold losers too long, and ego makes you size up when you shouldn’t.

No book or strategy will fix this for you; you only learn by facing it. The sooner you realize trading is 80% psychology and 20% strategy, the sooner you’ll start working on the real skill set that matters.

5. You won’t get rich with a small account.

Turning $1k into $100k in a year makes for a great screenshot, but it’s not reality. A small account limits your options and magnifies your risk. Realistic growth is slow, and it compounds over time. If you’re starting with $1 to 2k, your first goal should be survival and skill-building, not quitting your job.

The harsh truth is trading for income requires a big enough account to absorb losses and still generate meaningful returns. You don’t have to start huge, but you do need realistic expectations about what’s possible.

**Bottom Line**

Day trading isn’t the glamorous, quick-money lifestyle most people think it is. It’s a grind, it’s boring when done right, and it takes years to develop the skills and mindset needed to survive. If you’re still reading this and it doesn’t scare you off, that’s a good sign... you might have the patience and discipline to actually stick it out. Follow me for my next post.

Support/resistance, supply/demand, SMC, VWAP, trendlines, whatever your flavor is, the math usually checks out.



So why do most traders still lose?



Because it’s not a strategy problem.

It’s a self-control problem.



Everyone thinks they’ll follow their rules. Until they take a loss.

Or miss a move.

Or get bored at 11am and click something ""just to feel alive.”



The winners?

They aren’t more educated. They aren’t smarter.

They’re just more disciplined and they’ve built systems around that discipline.



• They only take A+ setups

• They pre-plan their session the night before

• They never deviate from their risk per trade

• They review every mistake, no matter how small

• They stay consistent even on the boring days



Trading doesn’t get easier.

You just get better at sticking to the plan.

And that part takes time.



Some traders need 5 years to figure this out.

Others get there in 1, if they’re honest with themselves early.

It personally took me 3.5 years and 1.5 years of consistent journaling + backtesting with a proper tool.

I tried to create a side thread with details,, it was deleted? - I dunno,, maybe you pay for that ability..??

I don't run pump and dumps,, I use the same name everywhere.

But twice after posting what I believe to be good stock picks I was verbally trashed instantly.  Now i can understand trying to protect your community,, thats cool,,, but some of you need some social skills and patience before you instantly attack anyone.

As i have noted, I am new to reddit,, but I'm not new to trading or other trader platforms,, so yeah you can actually go look me up. 

I came here because I am sick & tired of Twitter shaving off my followers every freaking week for over a year! I used to trade at thelion,, but got kicked off as well as years of dd about stocks for refusing to participate in what I believed to be a p&d.

My style is if its a good company & the base is good,, buy it. 

I like penny stocks all the way up to $amzn

I have an established history of pounding the table on quality stocks,, new traders should not have to start their trading careers buying canned spam when steak and lobster is available!

Yeah, I am a little annoyed with the instant unwelcome Reddit users have,, for me & likely other traders.

Technically I would like to find a trader community on a node,, not just ""hanging out on the net"".

If anyone finds one,, hit me up at @gmail

1fhbdxs,2024-09-15,2024-09-15 08:30:45,Why you will continue to fail time and time again. A message to struggling traders and beginners. ,"Hello fellow traders! This post will be focusing on practices I see a lot of struggling traders not do, or beginner traders not focus on. I'll provide some tips below.

I continuously see posts (and will probably continue to see more of these posts) about individuals who may be quitting trading, losing all their money, saying trading is a scam, etc. A common theme I see is that these same individuals do not have a proper foundation or system for their trading. Their biggest focus is the money, or a trading strategy. What you need to understand is that the trading strategy is ONE component of your trading system and achieving success.

Let's talk about the other side and what's needed besides strategy to succeed in this business.

  
**Data collection/Journaling:**

Journaling is extremely important because we need to determine what works and what doesn't. If you don't know what to journal, here are some prompts I use for mine;

1. What ticker or instrument was traded? (to determine where most of our money comes from and where we lose the most)

2. What time was the trade? (To determine when we make the most money, I make my money in the first half of the NY session, I don't trade the afternoon session)

3. What time frame was the trade taken on? (To determine our most profitable time frames, the time frames I use are the 5/15m, and 4hr time frames)

4. Why did you take the trade? (What was the reasoning or plan behind it?)

5. How did you feel before, after, or during the trade? (I see a lot of people skip this, this will bring to light thought or emotional patterns that mess up your trading)

6. What type of trade was it? (scalp, reversal, day trade, etc) (Again, this will help determine what trade types make you the most money. Whatever doesn't, we avoid)

7. What did you learn today, how can you improve for tomorrow?



**Rules:**

Rules are going to be an another key component of your trading career, we need to know what to do, or not do to protect ourselves against ourselves, and build discipline.  Below are some of mine;

  
1. Do not trade while tired (I would wake up right before market open and take silly trades and wonder why I wasn't profitable)

2. Do not trade in bed (seeing 1 time frame does not help, I need to see the whole picture)

3. Trade only your A & B setups from your playbook

4. Morning routine MUST be completed before trading

5. NEVER let a winning position go red (I see this happen to traders a lot, take your money, and go home. There will be more trades)

6. Trade must be planned before entering (if there is no plan, you are gambling)

7. Use proper risk management/size

8. If you get emotional, take a 1 hour break and do your emotional regulation techniques

9. After 3 loss' stop for the day

10. Do not trade during speeches/news events

11. Do not trade chop, it is not profitable for you

12. Do not look at the ticker when swing trading. 

13. market prep (watchlist, plan the day)



**Trading Psychology and Knowing yourself:**

  
Another key component for your trading success, you MUST know what triggers you in the markets and set up systems in place to limit your exposure to them, or have practices that slowdown the emotional regulation process to come back to a centered, neutral state. Trading in on both sides of the spectrum; excited/greedy, or fearful/revenge state is dangerous. 

I studied under Rande Howell and he helped me a ton. 

For myself, If my P/L is on, it tends to make it easier for me to get emotional so I have it turned off, the only way I know how much money I made or lost, is when im journaling after the trading session. The p/l is irrelevant to my trading plan so it stays off. I limit myself to only trade from 9:30am to 12noon eastern. I know for a FACT that if I stay on and I see another one of my setups, I will take it. Remember, we aren't here to catch every trade, tomorrow is another day. Trading for more than 2h30m drains me mentally. 



That's all for now that I can think of, hope this helped y'all. Cheers

  
TLDR: Stop being lazy, develop your trading system, journal everyday, create your rules list, and work on your trading psychology.

1jyli1w,2025-04-13,2025-04-13 19:51:24,How to Win The Game of Trading.,"This is a comprehensive read for anyone who is new to trading or is not profitable yet.



1. The Illusion of Profits.

	Most people join trading just because they see others getting rich from it. Everyone wants to get rich and they want to get rich fast. The game of trading is zero sum game. Meaning whatever money you make is lost by someone for you to make it. There is a general rule 90-90-90, 90% of people lose 90% of their money in the first 90 days of trading.



1. What do you Trade?

	there are many options, you can trade stocks, forex, crypto and more.

	if you decide to trade stocks then you need something called a stock screener, you need to lookout for a thing called earnings reports because that usually means there will be big movement on that stock.

If you trade forex then you need to understand currency strength, a little bit of geopolitics, interest rates and more things like core inflation. As for crypto I have no idea, my subjective opinion is that it is a fundamentally worthless asset only driven by sentiment.



1. Leverage.

	What is leverage? Leverage is your ability to buy or sell more of an asset than you can afford. A 1:100 leverage means, you can buy a 100 dollar asset for 1 dollar. But it also means that 1% movement in that asset would result in liquidation of your account. Leverage Does not change your P&L, lot size does. Leverage only allows you to increase what lot size trades you can enter.

At 0.01 lot size, your P&L is exactly the movement in asset price. If the asset moves 1 dollar up in value, then your profit is 1 dollar. If it moves 1 dollar down in value then your loss is 1 dollar.

You increase the lot size to 0.1 then 1 dollar change would result in 10 dollar P&L and at 1.0 lot size a 1 Dollar change results in 100 Dollar P&L.

Your effective leverage is different than your account leverage. Let’s say your account leverage is 1:100, asset price is 100. That means the margin required to enter a trade is 1 dollar only. how do you decide what effective margin is good for you? If your capital is large enough then just risking 0.5% or 1% should make you decent money. But if you wanna get risky then decide your effective leverage based on the largest dip any given asset has had in its history.

Let’s talk about XAU/USD. The biggest dip was 13% in one day. So at an effective leverage of 1:8 (100/8=12.5) should be okay for gold. So even if gold dips by 12.4% you will not be liquidated. Keep some extra money in case of a margin call. But as a trader a margin call should never be your concern. Always manage your risk.



1. Strategy.

	no matter what you are trading, you will need a strategy. Without strategy everything is useless. In Reality when you trade you are in competition not with other retail traders, but with institutions, hedge funds and algorithms. These are the people who just trade for a living, people with PHD’s in mathematics. So you need a strategy. That is your edge, your alpha. And overtime in a big enough time frame your alpha will decay, so you need to be dynamic. Some commonly used strategies are Support/Resistance, ICT, SMT, FVG, IFVG, Fib. If you do not have an edge then you ARE the edge. 



1. Win Rate.

	your risk to reward ratio should be a little consistent. At an RR of 1:2 at 35% win rate you will be profitable. Not a lot but yes you will be profitable. At an RR of 1:10 you will be profitable at 9.2% win rate. You will find a lot of different images online showing you breakeven percentage for different win rates and profit percentage for different win rates.



1. Discipline. 

	Trading is 50% strategy and 50% discipline. Let’s say you win two trades in a row and made 200 dollars. You are now emotional, your emotion makes you think one more trade won’t hurt and you know you will win right? And then you proceed to end up loosing what you made. Let’s say you lost money in both your trades instead of winning, now you are revenge trading and want to make your money back. ONLY RISK THE MONEY YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE. A general rule should be 2 trades max per any given asset per day and 5 total trades in any given day. For some people just sitting there and watching it go down is mentally taxing. That does not mean trading is not for you, that means you set your TP and SL based on your strategic needs and turn off your laptop or desktop for the day and get to doing other things.



1. Paper trading.

	Paper trade for 4 months to get an idea of the markets, learn about pips, slippage, ticks, SL, TP and events that affect your asset class, like earnings reports for stocks and FOMC events for Forex. 4 months so that no matter your asset class its enough for you to see a couple of earnings reports or at least one FED event. Try not to trade news, volatility might liquidate you. Whiplashes might liquidate you.



1. Stop Loss.

	Always set a Stop Loss. Based on your strategy your stop loss might differ but i do not know any strategy that does not need one. Stop loss is the first step to good risk management. NO MATTER WHAT ALWAYS SET A STOP LOSS. It’s okay to skip setting a TP but never okay to skip a STOP LOSS. 



1. F&O Trading.

	This is a subjective opinion you can choose to ignore, F&O is made for Hedging. Meaning let’s say you have a big investment position or a swing trade open in any asset. the asset going down in value would mean floating losses which you cannot sustain then for the equal or less amount of shares you buy a put option 3-24 months out for that asset. You keep rolling your option, meaning whenever you are 25-50% of the way to your expiry you roll the put so that you do not have to pay the full price for the next put and you do not lose money due to time decay. (If you were unfamiliar with any of these terms then you have a long way to go in futures and options.) 



Also another opinion of mine is that you trade options not futures so you do not have an obligation.



Again it is a zero sum game, some options go up thousands of percentages in value, IT DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL MAKE THAT MUCH MONEY FROM YOUR OPTION. Generally in a non volatile market you barely make double digit percentages let alone triple. futures and options do not move in congruence to the asset price, they move relative to the asset price. There is IV crushes, time decay and skew. 



Even for trading normal asset classes a good expectation would be 0.5-4% returns weekly. You do not need to trade daily, wait for good entry for your trades. You do not need to trade every single big move, never have FOMO. There will always be another opportunity. There are lots of people out there ready to become liquidity for you at any given moment if you have strategy and discipline.



If you trade stocks then on average they move 0.5% to 10% MAX. Thats once in three months during earnings report or some extremely good or extremely horrid news. Otherwise you do not get such moves, and the chances of you screening the stock and catching that move and not getting stopped out are low. Not 0 but low. So again a good expectation of returns is 0.5% to 4% MAX a week.



1. Risk Management.

	ONLY RISK 0.5% to 1.0% on each trade. It might seem minuscule but overtime your capital will grow if your edge is reliable. Once your position is in some profit, set a trailing stop loss, consistently trail it as price moves. Move it to breakeven once you are 50% to your tp, move it to 50% when you are 80% of the way to your TP. 



Some more things to consider is to learn what is a pip, how to calculate it, what are spreads and how they differ, whether your broker is a market maker or not. Roll over or swap fees for swing positions. 



HOW TO BE A SUCCESSFUL TRADER?



Get to work 30 minutes before market open, read finance news letters it could be any 2 newsletters of your choice that give you all the compiled information of everything you need. If you are trading FOREX then check forexfactory for any events for the day. Determine a bias for your asset whether its bullish or bearish and only enter in the direction of the bias (trend) if the market is bearish and you GO SHORT. Regardless of how fundamentally valuable the asset is.



Mark out trading zones for the day. Set alerts so you are notified everytime price reaches close to your zone. So you can do other work and do not have to be stuck to your computer. 



Journal your trades, track your stats like win rate, risk reward, max drawdown, emotion and other things.



Understand your equity curve, make sure its your edge that is making you money and not other things, because sometimes even for 3-5 months people consistently make money without edge only to realise its cause market moved in their favouring direction, not because their trades were actually working.





SPICY STUFF



If you go against what any good trader has to say and you trade news or you trade futures and options especially during volatility then I suggest you learn what straddles are and what hedging is. You make money regardless of whether the asset price goes up or down. But then you have to wait for a while before there is a retracement for your opposing position to be profitable or breakeven. Still straddling is better than mindlessly trading F&O or news. 





THIS IS STILL NOT THE FULL PICTURE



This is still not the full picture when it comes to trading, there are dark pools, there are brokers that bet against you, taxes and regulations once you are finally profitable, fear and greed indexes, overfitting during backtesting or lookahead, positive or negative co-relation between assets, macroeconomics, price manipulation, HFT front running news or just high volume trades or any big juicy candle, Kelly criterion and a ton of other stuff.

I am not responsible for the strategy's performance in the future or in your case, nor do I guarantee its profitability on your instruments. Any decisions you make are entirely at your own risk*

Check my previous post for more details!

# Idea

Stochastic is a momentum indicator, very similar to another indicators (like RSI).  
As the study shows, it is very good for entry. But to use it for exit, you need to trade Trend Following.  
We will look at how it can be used for Mean Reversion.

The indicator produces two lines and takes two periods. Unfortunately we will not use both, as the second one is just an average for the first one. ('D' line is not used in strategy).

>*Please don't take the title of the post or the pictures to heart. Do your research!*

# Strategy

* **Instrument**: US100 (NQ), US500 (ES)
* **TF**: 1D (*The strategy does not work on time frames below)*
* **Initial Capital:** 10k$
* **Lots (In money)**: 500$
* **Data Period**: 2012.01.19 - 2024.11.28

*The strategy buys only if there are no open trades. That is, there can be only 1 trade at a time.*  
*The strategy does not have a shortsell trades as instrument is often in the uptrend.*

***Inputs:***

1. K\_Period: **1**/2/3
2. LowTh: 10/15/20/**25**/35/45/50

*D\_Period=1*  
*Slowing=0*

**Buy Rules:** Stoch(K\_Period, D\_Period, Slowing).Fast < LowTh  
*Fast is 'K' Line*  
**Filter**: Close > SMA(200) (Optionally)  
**Close Rule**: Close > High\[1\]  
*So yesterday's close was higher than the day before that*

Since it is a [Mean Reversion](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/mean-reversion) strategy:  
**I do not recommend using the Stop Loss** as it increases the drawdown and reduces the profit.  
**I don’t recommend using Take Profit** as it reduces profits.

# Conclusions

1. Stochastic is perfect for entry, but bad for exit.
2. Works well on all MR instruments
3. 76% winrate, which is pretty normal for Mean Reversion.
4. The strategy has almost no optimization, but it works with the same parameters on all MR instruments.
5. You are free to choose when to exit the position.
6. Simple risk management is already doing more than the return of US100 with much lower drawdowns (7+ return / dd ratio)
7. Sharpe Ratio > 1, which is very rare for MR strategies.

>*Your task as a trader is to do more profit than an investor in the same time period on the same instrument.*  
*It can be done with a* ***portfolio of strategies***\*. With the right risk management it is possible to do it with a single strategy\*!",133,46,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1hk6h46/826_yearly_stochastic_mean_reversion/,all,Strategy,0.95

Wake up at 4am. Cold plunge. Read 10 pages. Meditate. No days off.
But that’s aesthetic discipline, it looks good. It feels productive.
But if you’re still chasing random trades at 8:47am… none of that matters.
Real discipline is:
Not clicking buy even when the setup looks good, but doesn’t follow your rules.


Sitting through a boring market because it’s not your environment.


Logging out with a $40 profit because that was the plan instead of turning it into a -$200 red day chasing dopamine.


Journaling that one mistake you keep making… and actually correcting it the next day.


Discipline isn’t loud.
It’s not flashy.
It’s not IG-story friendly.
But it pays.
And it stacks.
And it makes your life calm, not chaotic.
Most people are addicted to hype, motivation, and momentum.
Discipline is doing the exact opposite.
Even when it sucks.
Even when nobody claps for it.
Even when you don’t feel like it.
That’s why most people never get consistent.

122y2zq,2023-03-26,2023-03-26 16:15:28,What I Learned From Citadel’s Training Software,"## Introduction

When I was a Finance undergrad, one of the classes I most looked forward to was *Financial Trading Strategies.* While other classes were academic with textbooks and PowerPoint slides, our professor was a former market maker who taught us through hands-on experience. Throughout that semester, our professor gave us — using the same software Citadel uses to train their traders, by the way — simulated trading “cases.” Each case taught us to trade from the perspective of a different market participant. Our grades didn’t just depend on how much money we made, but on the PnL compared to our classmates! At the time, the stakes seemed higher than trading with real money.

Here are some things I learned during that semester.

## Isolate your exposures and hedge whenever possible.

## The Stat Arb Case

In the stat arb case, we were commodity traders trying to run a “location arbitrage” strategy. We could buy oil in cheaper locations and transport it to places where oil was more expensive. The market was compensating us for providing supply in markets with too much demand for oil and providing demand in places with too much supply. However, we couldn’t hedge our positions, so our risk was that oil prices worldwide would fall before we could offload our inventory.

This case emphasized the importance of hedging. Even though every trade I made had a positive expected value, many of my trades were losers when oil prices fell. I lost money because I wasn’t just trading the relative prices between locations, but I also had unhedged exposure to the global oil market.

## The Portfolio Management Case

In the portfolio management case, we were PMs managing a portfolio of 3 stocks. Our edge was that we knew the fair value of each of them (in real life, firms might have a team of analysts studying each stock and not giving CNBC interviews). Our job was to take long positions in undervalued or short overvalued stocks. However, our risk was that the stocks might move even further from fair value in the short term.

I quickly learned to take opposing positions to limit my risk to the overall market. If I were only long a bunch of stocks, I could sustain heavy losses during market downturns. Similarly, rally would demolish a short-only portfolio. Combining long and short positions made my portfolio more or less neutral to the broader market. Even if there were no overvalued stocks, I made sure to short something – this insulated me from market crashes and allowed me to leverage my long positions in undervalued stocks safely.

In options trading, hedging is even more important. Many options traders who are “wheeling” —selling cash-secured puts and covered calls— have a lot of long equity, short volatility positions and should be hedging their portfolios. Maybe shorting an index to balance out the long equity exposure of all these puts may be a good idea? Delta hedging is also an option. Buying options elsewhere to hedge the short volatility exposure from these wheel positions can also protect your portfolio from drawdowns.

## Size your trades based on your edge.

## The ETF Arbitrage Case

In the ETF arbitrage simulation, we were APs who could create and redeem shares of an ETF. When the price of the ETF was higher than that of the stocks in the ETF, we could buy the stocks and create shares of the (expensive) ETF to sell. Similarly, when the ETF became cheaper than the stocks, we could buy the cheap ETF and break it down into expensive stocks and sell them. The main risk was execution risk; the chance that our algo was broken or it was too slow, executing trades after the arbitrage was already gone.

This trading simulation was reasonably straightforward but taught me one important lesson: when there is an arbitrage (an edge with nearly no risk), we must trade as much as possible before it’s gone. In most simulations, I learned to maintain reasonable position sizes. However, ETF arbitrage was nearly risk-free, provided I wrote the algo correctly. If I didn’t trade aggressively, my classmates would be, and the arbitrage opportunity would disappear.

In the options markets, we should take many trades in small sizes. Systematic trading strategies such as selling weekly or monthly SPY options tend to be profitable over time, but only if the trader is careful with their position sizing.

## Work harder than anyone else.

This should be obvious, but for some reason, it isn’t. Many compete to make money in the markets; my class was no different. The PnL across the various trading simulations determined what your grades were going to be. While we had some trading simulations that we could trade by hand, we could choose to write algorithms to trade for us instead. Having studied each case beforehand, I spent hours outside of class writing python scripts to trade on my behalf. This allowed me to execute trades faster (and more accurately) than my classmates ever could by hand.

## The Liability Trading Case

In a liability trading simulation, we were brokers handling large orders for other institutional clients. Our edge was that, as brokers, we would receive bids for a large amount of stock at a slight premium or be offered large blocks of shares at a discount. However, because these trades were so large, we couldn’t just close our positions immediately. We had to split up our trades into several orders so they wouldn’t push the market around too much. Our risk was the possibility of the stock moving against us while we tried to sell our shares or cover our short positions over time.

Many of my classmates traded this simulation by hand. They would receive an order, use an excel spreadsheet to evaluate each trade, and offload their positions manually. Those who traded by hand needed up to a minute to process trades. As a result, they were exposed to the market for too long, and many trades moved against them. On the other hand, I processed orders in four to five seconds because I was using an algo to trade.

## An edge exists for a reason. It’s always about providing value.

Not a single trading simulation involved technical analysis. In every trading simulation, we had a role and a service to provide. We had a reason our trading strategies were profitable: we provided value in the market.

Liability traders help execute large trades for clients lacking the infrastructure or patience. Market makers provide the best bid and offer, giving traders better prices when they want to enter and exit positions. Portfolio managers can help resolve supply and demand imbalances in the market buying oversupplied, oversold securities. They can also short highly demanded, overvalued stocks. Finally, APs help keep ETF prices in line with stock prices through arbitrage.

Retail traders should be no different. The easiest services we can provide to the market involve risk premiums and price inefficiencies.

Risk premiums involve holding risk that the market tends to compensate traders for. Risk premiums include long equity & fixed-income positions (supplying equity and debt capital) and short options positions (supplying options). Remember that not all risk is created equal; day trading is risky but arguably provides no value to the market.

Trading price inefficiencies generally involve providing liquidity to market participants who might be forced to trade at bad prices. We can get paid by taking the other side of forced trades, which helps our counterparty get a better price. More on this in the next point …

## Not everyone is doing things for the same reason. Trade with people who are forced to.

In real markets, many people are forced to trade at bad prices. Many institutional funds have rules that require them to buy options as a hedge, no matter the price. Some hedge funds sell their lower-quality holdings before their annual reports so they don’t have to explain to investors why they’re bag-holding the latest meme stock. They then repurchase these stocks after their report. If enough hedge funds sell the same stocks at the same time, these stocks temporarily become too cheap.

## The Market Making Case

The market-making simulation was one of the hardest. We provided quotes on three stocks, and our job was to earn money collecting the bid/ask spread. The hard part was keeping the spread; since we were often on the wrong side of trades; a wave of buying would leave us short stock while the market rallied, and a wave of selling would leave us holding the bag. While we collected the spread with every trade, keeping our positions neutral was extremely difficult.

I’m not going to lie. My market-making algorithm was terrible. I would get flooded with orders on one side and be forced to dump my inventory at even worse prices. However, I noticed that everyone was panic buying or dumping stock at the same times I was. So, in my next iteration, I decided to change my strategy. Rather than competing with other MMs for orders, I would wait for a wave of buy orders and join them. These orders, alongside my own, caused my classmates’ algorithms to shift their prices higher and higher as they desperately attempted to cover their short positions. I would then helpfully sell them my stock at inflated prices. Sometimes, I would see a wave of sell orders and short the stock, knowing I could buy back it at a discount as the other market makers tried to dump their inventory.

Did I end up successfully building a market-making program? Unfortunately, no. But I made a lot of money.

1mtbv6k,2025-08-18,2025-08-18 00:06:59,Simple process I used to turn around my trading.,"I struggled alot my first few years. Even during bull markets. I was exceptionally bad.

Of everything I tried the only that that has worked for me was finding ways to remove trades. I started going through every single trade quarterly and yearly with the sole objective of finding simple systematic rules that would cleave off a chunk of losers without removing too many winners and ideally no big winners.

Here are some of the simple rules I implemented:  
  
1. Small cap gappers. I see big candle and can't help but think, I must find a way to capture some of that. After years of trying, I failed. I had a few meager wins, and tons of losses. Rather then trying to figure out how to make it work, I decided to give up and not trade them at all. At the time, these made up roughly 15% of my losses, and basically no gains.

2. Trades past 9am (pst). This was a tricky one to notice but I have timestamps when I download my executions and once I filtered for these, the results were embarrassing. I don't remember the exact figures, but it was something like 3 wins and 40 losses. I felt like an idiot for not realizing this earlier. Many people trade throughout the day, and especially the last hour with success. I am not one of those people.

3. Biotech stocks. Many swing traders like myself trade these with success. I have no idea what I'm missing, but these categorically give me almost no winners. 

4. Low ATR (low volatility stocks). I technically was slightly worse off completely removing these but the meager gains and capital they required weren't worth the trouble.

I haven't really changed much about the rest of my strategy. Here are some rough estimates of my results:

Year 1: 800 trades, -50%  
Year 2: 600 trades, -30%  
Year 3: 250 trades, 20%  
Year 4: 150 trades, 80%

The results themselves maybe aren't that impressive, but I went from losing money and miserably trading all day to 1 hour for post-market prep, and watch/trade the markets the first 2 hours.",126,43,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1mtbv6k/simple_process_i_used_to_turn_around_my_trading/,all,Advice,0.96
1jourtt,2025-04-01,2025-04-01 08:49:33,80% Yearly Returns Trading Big Caps - My Basic Tips,"

First things first, trading for a living is going to take time. I explained this in my last post. This requires a tremendous amount of screen time. But guess what? So does every other profession. The reward from this is much greater so why on earth would anyone think it can be done without tons of studying. 



Choose your battle. Trading is amazing and I don't need to tell you why, you already know them that's why you're here. It takes time but it's doable and rewarding.



I'm not the best trader. I strive for a 80%+ yearly return. Risking too much is the fastest way to say goodbye to your dreams. This is a probability game after all. Big gains also mean big losses or frequent smaller losses.



All you need is basic support and resistance and so do every other full-time stock trader I know of - me included.



So this will not be about some *''liquidity level2 0.69 fibonacci grab''*\- method. 



**This is about understanding the fundamentals of stock trading and so you can be one step closer to consistent wins. Month after month.** 



If you trade forex or any other markets then this will not be for you. (You shouldn't btw but that's for another time).



I see way too many destructible posts about people making 100k starting from 1k. That's pure gambling and if that's what you want then this post is not for you either.

Anyone can put 1k on green in roulette and make 36k or whatever. Trading is a business and a fulltime job where you run it like any other business, long hours, tons of discipline, and you rely on consistent returns.



If you only want to be rich then it's easier to start some other business.



Okay enough rambling.



1. **A simple strategy for trading stocks (In this current market)**



\-Only use the daily and the 15m chart. Both have to trend in the same direction - Always start with looking at the daily chart. YOu want to see a nice trend over the past month. Vice versa for shorts.



\-Only trade big caps with volume (10b+). Why? Because you don't want the stock to reverse because Johns's grandma was selling her bag when you went long. Big caps tend to respect technicals more and they require big money to move (institutions) - this is where you want to be.



\-Use the 10ema intraday and on the daily chart you want the 50 SMA and 200 SMA. Later on you can add/play around with 8ema/15ema/21ema to fit your personality but for now, let's keep it simple.



\-Be ready to swing and day trade. The market right now is in a difficult swing environment so you stick to day trading. The market conditions will change from time to time and you need to have a diversified toolbox.

\-Draw horizontal support and resistance levels from the daily chart, and also trendlines.

\-Do not chase a stock. Let the opportunity come to you.

\-Don't trade the OPEN

\-Never counter-trend trade. The stock is down for the day? Don't go long and vice versa. Best setups happen when the stock is above or below yesterday's high/low.

\-Don't trade EARNINGS

\-Look for smooth bullish charts on the daily for longs and vice versa for shorts

\-Look for stocks that are above/low yesterdays high/low. 

\-You want to see above average volume

\-Learn different basic options strategies such as debit/credit spreads, puts, and calls, and how they work in general. Don't buy OTM calls/puts. More on that some other time.



\-Always trade in the direction of SPX/SPY and QQQ. I call it the ''market''. If the market is down, look for shorts, if it's up, look for longs.  

\-Don't trade the market itself, it's harder and unnecessary.





The market will drag most of the stocks with it, so going long a stock when the market is going down is like surfing with bad waves. You won't get far. Wait for the market and your stock will surf smoother.



Examples of a few trades I took:



Market: As we don't have a clear direction for swings, I stick to day trading for now. Market is bearish and I've been focusing on finding stocks to short.



This is the kind of daily chart you're looking for, even if you're day trading only. Clear bearish trend with a technical break.



Got an alert on a bearish break on $AVGO on the daily chart. At the same time, the market was struggling to get above its 200 SMA. The market showed its weakness with a bearish flush in the first 15 minutes and it held nicely under the 10 sma, the longer it held the more bearish I became for the day.



This is how the market looked on 26.3-28.3.

[SPY 15m ](https://preview.redd.it/mnkv7ay2o7se1.png?width=971&format=png&auto=webp&s=321ab30d70a3ca78f424c7cf3f6152abd2524f2c)

Then let's look at my pick $AVGO from a daily chart first:

[AVGO daily chart. Nice bearish trend. This is what you are looking for when finding shorts.](https://preview.redd.it/3rl8ompfo7se1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=a99035a19654fb1cb284ffc7e17dde0d182ea13b)

  
Next, we look at the intraday where I shorted. Because in this market I don't want to swing yet.

[AVGO 15m chart. Compare it to the SPY chart above and you can see why and where I shorted.](https://preview.redd.it/43iep6lpo7se1.png?width=1215&format=png&auto=webp&s=af99f2e5dfa75b0d8e4a15d901f429fabb8861c2)

Now, I could have held my first short position overnight and made massive profits instead of just daytrading it. But the thing is, the market could have easily gapped up the next day and all my profits could have been gone. Just look at SPY and you can see that there has not been very good swing opportunities in the last week. 

This is how I trade week after week. When the market conditions changes, so do my trading. But the fundamentals are always the same - 

Bullish stocks& Bullish market = long

Bearish stock&bearish market=short 

  
Now, go find 5 bullish stocks and 5 bearish stocks from the daily chart. Make sure they are not near a support/resistance level. Keep them on your watchlist while you look at the market during the day, when you are sure of a direction (bullish/bearish spy) take a position in the best stock in your watchlist that is above it's yesterdays high/low. 

This is something you should not do with REAL money for now. It's only for practice. You will get in the flow of the whole market and learn when to enter/exit. Focus on intraday trading only for this. 

Look for smooth stocks, no crazy candles and make sure it has no upcoming earnings this week.

Some bearish stock examples I look for in this current market (daily chart).

[NKE](https://preview.redd.it/gzmdlkcdy7se1.png?width=1497&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e791aa7c89ffe89c1fe1246e2082e4a0f9611ab)

After I find these stocks i put them on my watchlist and I trade them if the market condition is favorable.

Same thing for longs in a bullish market (which it is not).

I also scan during the day over 400 stocks every now and then to see if something is building up. 

  
Okay that's it for now, keep studying and I'm here to help if you have questions.

I feel completely trapped, and I don’t know how to move forward. I’ve made the same mistake over and over again, and now it feels like there’s no way out.

Over the past few years, I borrowed money from my sister three separate times, believing I could make it back through trading crypto. Each time, I convinced myself that I had learned from my mistakes, that I would be more disciplined, that this time it would be different. But I was wrong. Every single time, I lost everything.

Now, I am in the worst financial situation of my life. I have no savings, a mountain of debt, and absolutely no one left to turn to. I’m ashamed, I feel like a failure, and I can’t even bring myself to talk to my sister about it again. She helped me when she could, and I threw it all away chasing a dream that I couldn’t make work.

I’m currently drowning in **loans and credit card debt that far exceed my monthly salary**, and even though I still have a job, I don’t see a way to cover my obligations without getting even deeper into the hole. The anxiety is crushing me, and I don’t know what to do. I keep going back and forth between trying to trade my way out of this or just giving up completely. But I know that trying to gamble my way out is what got me here in the first place.

What scares me the most is that even now, despite everything, my mind keeps convincing me that if I could just lower my debt to a more manageable level, I could still make money from trading and fix everything. I’ve gone through this cycle so many times—telling myself that I only need to make $80-100 a day for six months to get back on track, and for a while, I did. But the moment I started losing, I instantly took out more credit and threw it back into the market without a second thought. I’ve even received payouts from prop firms a couple of times, but it always ended the same way. The fact that I still have this mindset, even now, terrifies me. I feel like I can’t stop myself.

I don’t know what I’m hoping to get out of posting this. Maybe advice? Maybe just someone to tell me I’m not completely alone in this? If anyone has ever been in a situation like this and managed to get out, I would love to hear how you did it. Right now, I feel like I’ve destroyed my future and there’s no coming back from this.

On paper, it was the dream job: stable pay, access to capital, and the illusion of prestige. But here’s the part no one tells you, most hedge funds don’t actually innovate. They recycle the same old factor models, fight for scraps of alpha, and drown in bureaucracy.

Meanwhile, the retail world has quietly evolved. With today’s tech, a small team (or even a single obsessed coder) can build strategies that rival or outperform what we ran in-house. The structural edge hedge funds used to have is gone, execution costs are near zero, APIs are wide open, and cloud compute is dirt cheap.

So I left. I poured everything into designing and stress-testing my own systems. Not flashy, not “get rich quick” nonsense — just robust, data-driven algos running across multiple markets.

What surprised me most wasn’t the returns (though those shocked me too)… it was the freedom. Not having to answer to an IC committee, not having to pitch every idea, not being capped by arbitrary risk budgets. Just pure research → code → live execution.

I’ll be honest: it’s terrifying sometimes. But when I look at my equity curves now (screenshots attached), I can’t help but think this was the right move.

Curious if anyone else here has taken the leap from “institutional” to “independent”? Do you feel like retail strategies are actually more agile now than what big funds are running?

* Only took trades during my best hours. If the edge wasn’t there, neither was I. For me that's the first 2 hrs of NY and the last hour (power hour) We do tend to get nice reversals in power hour.
* Zoomed out. Watching every micro candle made me impulsive. 
* Walked away after setting alerts. No more screen addiction. I set alerts at the levels that my setup might form, usually daily o session high/lows.
* Tracked forced trades inside TradeZella. Patterns exposed themselves. Really put it in front of your face, as humans, it's easy for us to ignore our problems unless it's very apparent.
* Focused on quality: 1 A+ setup > 5 random stabs.
* Made cash a position. Doing nothing became part of the strategy. I struggled with this mostly, I thought I had to trade every single day and that's far from the truth.

I looked into premium trading courses online, but they were way out of my budget at first. Still, I kept grinding diving deep into trading forums, reading everything I could find about market psychology, risk management, and technical setups. After months of selfstudy, I invested more time and money into learning by purchasing some courses and dedicating myself fully to mastering the craft.

From there, I studied hard and applied what I learned every day focusing on strategies like trend following, momentum plays, and managing position sizes carefully. About three months in, I started noticing real gains. My confidence grew as my trades became more consistent and profitable

As a husband, a dad of five, and a full-time trader, I’ve experienced firsthand the challenges and rewards that come with making trading a full-time career. It’s been a journey of growth, discipline, and constant learning.

Over time, I’ve gathered insights that have helped me navigate some of the highs and lows, and I figured they might be valuable to others as well.

Whether you're considering making trading your full-time career or just looking to refine your approach, I hope you find something useful here.

**Here's my post:**

I was chatting with my wife the other day, trying to explain how I’ve learned to trade.  
She’s an incredible cook, so I explained it to her like this:

""It’s like how you first started learning to cook sourdough bread.""

""Okay, can you expand?"" she asked, rightly.

""When you first started learning how to bake sourdough bread, there were a few different skills you had to master for the end result to work.

Making sourdough requires a few things: a starter, the right mixture of ingredients, the correct amount of kneading, and the bake settings and timeframe must be just right.

You then had to develop the skill to master each part. It took practice and patience to get the starter just right. Understanding the nuance of mixing the ingredients took time. You had to learn how long to knead. Getting the right bake settings took reps to perfect.

And after every loaf that wasn’t up to par, you had to review, problem-solve, and make notes on what to adjust next time.

The reality is that when you made your first sourdough, there was no way you could get every part right the first time, or the second, third, or fourth.

It takes reps to get each part right, and only after mastering each aspect can everything come together into something delicious.”

Individual skill sets, when combined, give us the results we want in our trading: product, setup, market conditions, volume, price action, execution, all while managing risk. We then combine them all to hopefully get something good.

She wasn’t as excited about this analogy as I was, but she said she got the gist.

# Where Most New Traders Get It Wrong

Trying to learn a new skill is like trying to drink from a fire hose, especially in the beginning. It’s overwhelming, you're trying to do too many things at once, and you're unsure if you're making progress at all.

Despair quickly sets in, and you feel like quitting.

It can be incredibly frustrating, and it's a big reason why the dropout rate in trading is so high.

But there is a solution.

# A Different Recipe

Instead of trying to learn trading all at once, break it down into individual skills to master.""

Then, learn those skills one at a time, all while keeping losses small (because we’re going to mess up in the beginning, A LOT). You can still place trades while you learn, but think of it as your tuition. And why pay more tuition than you need to?

Here’s how to do it:

**1. First, learn about the job.**

If there was a job posting, here’s a summary of your daily tasks:

* Figure out where the money is flowing (finding stocks to trade).
* Identify the most common patterns (setups).
* Develop a game plan to trade these patterns (strategy).

Later on:

* Which patterns are you best at? (Use your journaling data).
* Scale up on your best patterns (start increasing risk, slowly).
* Marry market environment to specific patterns (pay attention to the market—it’s a tailwind).

There are countless books and resources that can expand on what trading is really like. I personally like SMB Capital’s YouTube library of videos (their early videos are great and free).

**2. Then learn the skill of losing less than you make.**

Keeping your money safe is the most important part of trading. Now, read that again.

I’m serious. If you can’t get the risk management part right, it’s over. But don’t worry, it’s much less complicated than we think.

Here are a few tips:

* When entering any trade, think *risk-first*. Don’t think about what you can make, first, think about how much you could lose. Now, read that again.
* Think in terms of basic math: If your average winning day is $50, your daily max loss should be no more than 1-2 days' worth of gains.
* This is why being specific in your entries is so crucial. You may only get one entry on the day, so you need to make it count. If you think you may need two attempts, risk half your max loss for a ticker, that way you still have ammo left.
* These amounts will become clearer over time and should generally be a percentage of your average daily win amount.

**3. Learn the skill of managing yourself.**

As you start to trade more, you’ll want to do some stupid stuff, some of which you won’t be able to explain. So, you need to figure out how to “tame the dragon” before that happens. (Or was it a werewolf? Same idea.)

Don’t worry, it’s not that complicated. It really comes down to your systems and how well you can follow them.

Think of McDonald’s making a burger: They have a system for making a Big Mac, and all you need to do is stick to the steps, and you’ll be fine. You get into trouble when you start making it up, that’s when you get frustrated and start throwing burgers at the wall. Why not avoid it altogether?

Learn to write everything down to make it easy and repeatable. Write down things like your checklist for finding the right stocks, maybe a process for how to judge a setup, or a journal entry you read each morning. Whatever the system looks like for you, it’s a skill set that must be learned.

*Also, keeping your trade size small throughout your learning process will really help take away a lot of the emotion and make things a lot easier. I talking 1-4 shares.*

**4. Learn the skill of operating like a business.**

You’re going to have costs, systems, and standard operating procedures, and it’s going to take a while to figure out; just like any other business.

You’ll also need to learn all about order entries and what works best for you.

Learn what tools you need by always starting with the free version if it’s offered, and only pay for something if there’s no other way around it.

A journaling service, live market data, and a simple stock scanner are often the first expenses you’ll incur. I like Edgewonk, Interactive Brokers, and Chart Watcher because they’re affordable and they work.

**5. Learn the skill of learning.**

As the sole business owner, when things hit the fan, you’re the only one who can fix it and make it better. And that’s a skill set.

When you’re in a drawdown (a fancy word for “you suck” right now), you need to be able to identify what’s causing the issue, take the emotion out, and resolve it.

Just like with our sourdough recipe in the beginning, if the bread doesn’t come out properly, you need to be able to identify what changes need to be made.

Learn how to learn.

# Finding Your Path

Remember, you’re learning each skill separately. That’s the secret; breaking down trading into easy-to-digest, bite-sized pieces. And as you learn, start stacking each skill set.

At first it feels slow, like you’re barely making progress. But just like baking the perfect sourdough, the small improvements compound.

Over time, what once felt overwhelming becomes second nature. One day, you’ll realize you’re no longer second-guessing every decision, your process feels natural, and your results start to reflect the effort you’ve put in.

Trading isn’t about mastering everything at once, it’s about consistently refining each piece until the whole thing works together.

So keep stacking those skills, keep refining the recipe, and eventually, you’ll be executing those perfect trades.",116,25,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ixvs7w/trading_is_stacking_skillsets/,all,Advice,0.95

# Idea

Almost all price-action indicators provide a delay.  
What if I told you that you could remove or reduce this delay? In this strategy we explore **Laguerre RSI.**

This is a slightly modified RSI that works without Lookback Period. Instead it takes the value for the adaptive filter. In fact, it is an oscillator that gives us values from 0.0 to 1.0.

# Strategy

* **Instrument**: US100 (NQ)
* **TF**: 1D (*The strategy does not work on time frames below)*
* **Initial Capital:** 10k$
* **Risked Money**: 500$
* **Data Period**: 2012.01.19 - 2024.11.28

*The strategy buys only if there are no open trades. That is, there can be only 1 trade at a time.*  
*The strategy does not have a shortsell trades as instrument is often in the uptrend.*

***Inputs:***

1. Gamma - **0.3**/0.4/0.5
2. LagLow - **0.2**/0.25/0.3
3. LagHigh - **0.6**/0.7/0.8

**Buy Rule:** LagRSI(Gamma) < Low

**Close Rule**: LagRSI(Gamma) > High. Exit on friday. Exit after 30 days.  
*You can experiment with the close rule: select another indicator, period, a certain price level, day or just close at the first successful closing of the price (close of candlestick > buy price)*

Since it is a [Mean Reversion](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/mean-reversion) strategy:  
**I do not recommend using the Stop Loss** as it increases the drawdown and reduces the profit.  
**I don’t recommend using Take Profit** as it reduces profits.

# Conclusions

1. Works well with absolutely any input parameters on the specified instruments. This is a good signal of robustness!
2. Slightly correlated with the previous one, as it uses RSI formula for entry.
3. Works well without filters.
4. Return/DD Ratio and Sharpe Ratio are much better than the usual RSI, although the winrate is almost the same.
5. The strategy is very sensitive to exit conditions. Try changing the indicator or rules. I think it makes sense to make a non-symmetric exit.

","I've been mulling over this question for a while now, and I've come up with a few thoughts. It seems that, from what I've seen, success in stock trading often boils down to being in one of three categories:

1. Professionals managing other people's money, usually for a fee.
2. Insiders or market makers who have an edge in a particular market.
3. Unfortunately, there's also the possibility of fraudsters manipulating the system for their benefit.

But here's the thing - these categories aren't always black and white. There can be overlaps, and it's not always clear-cut who falls into which category.

That said, outside of these roles, it feels like success in stock trading becomes a bit of a gamble. It doesn't seem to matter how much you know or how educated you are.",119,160,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1d7542v/who_really_succeeds_in_stock_trading/,all,Discussion,0.94

*\*DMA = Daily Simple Moving Average\**

**-Today's Close > 50DMA > 150DMA > 200DMA**

**-200DMA > 200DMA from one month ago (200DMA is upsloping)**

**-Today's Close is up at least 30% from 52 wk low**

**-Today's Close is within at least 25% from 52 wk high**

&#x200B;

**Additional Criteria:**

**-5 Day High < 50 Day High + one MDR** (median daily range) *\*This eliminates stocks that have broken out already.\**

**-Today had at least 270 one minute bars** *\*A liquid stock such as AAPL trades 390 minute bars per day (6.5 hours x 60 minutes per hour), while a less liquid stock may have many minute long periods without a single round lot transaction, resulting in fewer printed one minute bars.\**

**-Base length of at least 7 days** *\*I'm only interested in stocks that have been correcting or basing for at least seven days.\**

**-50 Day Median Dollar Volume** (volume \* (OHLC4 or VWAP)) **> $100M** *\*My personal trade stats suggest that my trading in names with lower liquidity have actually been net unprofitable while trades in more liquid stocks have been highly profitable.\**

**-50 Day Median Dollar Volume / Market Cap >= .75%** (Dollar Volume as a percentage of Mkt Cap) *\*Similar to my findings on Dollar Volume, I have found that my trades have been much more profitable in stocks that trade at least .75% of their market cap in median dollar volume. I surmise that this is reflective of 'relative interest' and that 'hot' stocks are more likely to trend because they attract momentum/breakout traders - a self-fulfilling prophecy.\**

* I started journaling every trade and tracking the time of day.
* It became obvious — almost all my winners happened during the New York session.
* Everything outside of NY? Mostly losses or wasted energy.

Good setups are worthless if you trade them at the wrong time.

Where to start, I feel ashamed and hopeless. I entered the world of trading 4 years ago, in the crypto boom of 2021. And here we are today, 4 years later, and each time I think I know less. Is this even possible? 

I consider myself a normal person, I'm a chemical engineer, but my work doesn't satisfy me, and I promised myself that it would be this art of trading, with a lot of effort and dedication, that would elevate me and provide a life worth living. 

I always knew that there were no shortcuts, I never fell for the scam of thinking that this was easy money... but how can I tell the people closest to me that after so much dedication, after so many times telling my wife that I couldn't do it now, or that I'm busy when I'm looking at charts and have nothing to show for it, if you'd taken the other side of all my trades until now, you'd be millionaires, I'm consisntent on losing money. 

And I even played poker semi-professionally, multi-tabling with 16 tables, and it was profitable, I thought trading was just another similar game, with a defined risk reward and that it was a question of knowing the game.

But no, I know that there's nothing you can tell me that will miraculously make me profitable, and part of me would like to forget that I ever started this journey, because now I feel that if I never manage to reach the profitability that I've failed to achieve in my life.

1hr70ra,2025-01-01,2025-01-01 12:01:59,The ONLY 2 Indicators You Need,"Happy New Year everyone! Let's start 2025 off with a bang.

In this post, I want to share with you the ONLY 2 indicators you really need to trade stocks successfully.

Sure, you most likely use other indicators that you feel give you conviction to take a trade, be it RSI, Moving Averages, Fibonacci etc.

Whatever it is, they’re all going to be lagging indicators, meaning that they all just follow what price does.

However, the following two indicators are REAL TIME and tell you 90% of what you need to know about the direction of a stock, and that’s…

**Volume and Relative Volume (RVOL).**

I know, these indicators are not new wonderful revelations, but you’d be surprised by how many traders do not apply them properly.

Let me give you some major reasons exactly how these indicators can help you.

\--------------------------------------------

Let’s begin with Volume.

Volume is typically shown below the stock chart as a bar. It’ll be measured as dollar amount (how much money has been traded) or a share amount (how many shares have been traded). It doesn’t really matter which type of volume you use; they both follow the same concept.

When it comes to analysing a stock, I put a lot of emphasis on how much volume there is at the END of the day (when the bar has been completed) – obviously we don’t know how much volume there’ll end up being if it’s any earlier; the volume could completely drop off mid-day.

Anyway, here are two ways Volume can help you:

# 1. Institutional Buying

When the big boys (i.e. banks, hedge funds, pension funds etc.) buy, they will leave footprints behind. Their buying power is so much bigger than retail investors so it’ll be apparent in the volume bar, and they won’t buy all in one go, they’ll buy in stages, so price is likely to be supported and continue rising.

So when you see a huge volume bar at crucial moments (e.g. when a sold is considered oversold or after a major catalyst), you can bet that institutions are piling into the stock. This can be a good time to buy – whether you want to be conservative and average into the stock or buy all at once, that’s up to you.

# 2. A True Bounce

When the market/stock is in a downtrend, how do you know when it’s really over?

There’s going to be a lot of dead cat bounces that fool traders into thinking it’s the start of a new uptrend, only for price to make a lower low.

The key is to wait for signs of institutional accumulation that show up in the form of volume and support – don’t just blindly buy on ‘dips’ or guesswork because trying to time the bottom without confirmation is a recipe for disaster.

So when you see several gap downs on huge volume and price consolidates then makes a higher low, then there’s a high chance that the market/stock has bottomed.

\--------------------------------------------

Now let’s move onto Relative Volume (RVOL).

This indicator compares a stock’s current amount of volume with its previously traded volume over a certain period of time. This is either measured as a percentage or ratio, depending on the platform you’re using.

The higher the RVOL is, the more buyers and sellers are participating in that stock at that particular moment – this is about as real-time as you get.

So let’s see how RVOL can you help you with your trading:

# 1. Trading Breakouts

Breakouts are annoying to play (just my opinion!) because there are so many false breakouts especially in a sideways or downtrending market.

However, a high conviction breakout is one that happens on big volume – in a bad market, the stock may give you enough time to get out before hitting your stop loss; in a good market, the stock will likely rocket.

Big volume at the crucial breakout level will occur when strong demand meets a lack of supply, causing the price to pop up significantly.

So if you’re trading breakouts and you’re constantly getting stopped out, then consider ONLY trading breakouts that occur on high RVOL (combine this with an uptrending market and you WR will probably increase).

# 2. Trading Catalysts

One of my main and favourite setups is catalyst based gap ups, otherwise known as Episodic Pivots, Gap and Go, and other names.

If a stock gaps up over major resistance levels on huge RVOL, then you better put it on your watchlist for a potential entry – how you enter and manage the trade is another story which I’ll cover another time.

For me, the two major factors that determine whether I enter the trade or not is:

(a) A significant catalyst such as earnings.

(b) A high RVOL that’s at least 4x or 400% of its usual traded volume.

If the play doesn’t meet both of these factors, then I’m passing on it.

Of course, it doesn’t mean that the trade will work out; even if all the stars were aligned, your trade can still go against you – that’s why we adhere to risk management.

\--------------------------------------------

So, if you’re not using both the Volume and Relative Volume indicators, start using it now and see how your trading improves.

Background : I lost my job in February. Early 60s so I figured, rather than go back to the labor market, I'd transition to trading full time. And when people asked what I was going to do, I said. 

I started during covid, like many, so had been through the learning curve. But this year was, obviously, more intense and I'm finally pulling ahead in the black.

Later I them I told them I couldn't, for the same reason I wouldn't tell them how to spend their money in any other situation, and they dropped it. 

Now, they're asking again. I just said to look at data. 

If anyone has some advice on how to get it across, in a nice way, just how uncool it is to approach it like this, please do.

1kdsndj,2025-05-03,2025-05-03 09:12:12,I lost my $100K funded account — need real advice to rebuild and grow,"Hey everyone,

Two days ago, I lost my $100K funded trading account. It’s been a tough pill to swallow, but I want to share my story honestly and ask for real advice from those who’ve been through the grind.

# How it all started:

I began trading around six months ago. Started with $5K, made some profits, and used that to buy a $10K prop account. Passed it, then moved on to a $100K account.

To be completely transparent — I know I passed the $5K and $10K phases mostly due to luck and some good signals. But when I got to the $100K account, I was serious. I genuinely wanted to make it work.

# What went wrong:

In the early stages, I was doing well — slowly growing, staying disciplined. But then a family issue came up, and my consistency fell apart. I hit breakeven, and that’s when the downward spiral began. One bad day turned into panic. Eventually, I blew the account.

# Some hard truths I’ve realized:

1. **I don’t have a proper strategy** — but I know deep down I’m ready to learn one that works. I’m ready to give it everything. Time, energy, effort — whatever it takes.
2. **I thought my psychology was strong**, but there are cracks — especially when facing losses beyond my expected risk. I want to fix this.
3. **Risk management is the only thing that kept me afloat** for 4 months. That’s the one pillar I’ve held onto.

Right now, I have just **$27 left in that account**, and I know realistically it’s not enough to recover $7K. So I’m planning to go back to the basics — maybe start again with $5K, and rebuild step-by-step.

# What I’m asking for:

I’m here because I truly want to master this field from the ground up. If you have a strategy that gives solid RR and long-term consistency, I’m ready to learn. I’m not looking for shortcuts anymore.

Please share your insights, tips, or anything you wish you knew when you were starting out. I’ll appreciate every bit of guidance.

I’m fully committed to forging myself into a consistently profitable trader. Not just for money — but for the mastery of the game.

Thanks in advance for reading and helping. 🙏",115,263,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1kdsndj/i_lost_my_100k_funded_account_need_real_advice_to/,all,Advice,0.9

1lj8ubg,2025-06-24,2025-06-24 07:41:07,Leaving trading until I become disciplined,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been in the markets for the past 3–4 years. I’ve made some profits, I’ve taken some losses — thousands of hours spent watching charts, backtesting, learning ICT concepts, journaling, tweaking strategies… you name it.

Over the last year, I’ve been trading a system with a 50% win rate and a risk-reward of 1:2 to 1:4. It’s a solid strategy, and when I followed it, I was breakeven at worst and profitable at best. But the problem wasn’t the markets — it was me.

My psychology got in the way. Greed. FOMO. Impatience. Overtrading. But most of all, a lack of discipline.

And if I’m being honest, that lack of discipline doesn’t just show up in my trading — it’s everywhere in my life. I try to wake up early… and fail the next day. I say I’ll stop watching porn… relapse. Plan to exercise… never stay consistent. Go to bed at 11… doomscroll until 3am. And then the cycle repeats.

How can I expect to be a disciplined trader when I’m not even a disciplined person?

So I’ve made a decision:
I’m stepping away from trading completely for the next year.

No charts. No backtesting. No trade recaps. Nothing.

I’m going to take that time to rebuild myself — my habits, my mindset, my health, my self-control. I want to come back not just as a better trader, but as a better person overall.

Wishing all of you the best in your own journeys. I’ll be back — but only when I’ve earned the right to be.

1kjm51a,2025-05-10,2025-05-10 18:29:29,90% of Traders Fail - But the Statistics Don’t Tell the Whole Story,"I was replying to someone here earlier, and figured the point might be worth sharing more broadly with this community.

We’ve all heard it: *“90% of traders fail.”* It’s one of the most quoted statistics in trading circles. But have you ever actually stopped to ask: *why* is that the case?

I’ve always had an issue with how this statistic is presented - not because it’s untrue, but because it’s misleading without context.

Let me give you an example.

Say a popular YouTube trading video goes viral. 100 people watch it. Motivated and hyped up, maybe 40 of them open a brokerage account the same week. Out of those, most have no background in finance, no strategy, no idea what risk management even means. They start trading with real money anyway.

Meanwhile, also on that same platform, are a handful of traders with 3, 5, even 10 years of experience. They've built systems, tested strategies, blown up accounts, learned risk control, and stayed in the game.

A year later, 36 of those 40 beginners are gone - accounts blown or abandoned. 4 are still active, but struggling. Only 1 might have found a way to be consistently profitable. The others - the veterans - are still there, still compounding, still refining their edge.

Now let’s run the stats: 100% traders started that year. 10% are still profitable. 90% failed. Voilà - there’s your 90%/10% split.

But what does that really reflect? Is it a condemnation of trading as a profession? Or just a consequence of mass participation without preparation?

**This is the real issue**: trading has **no barriers to entry.** Anyone can click a few buttons and be in the market within hours — no license, no qualification, no knowledge required. That’s what makes it beautiful, and dangerous.

So the “90% fail” stat doesn’t reflect the nature of trading. It reflects human behavior - overconfidence, lack of discipline, emotional reactions, FOMO, revenge trading - and how unprepared most people are when they start.

If trading outcomes were random, we’d expect a 50/50 split over time. The fact that it skews so heavily toward failure tells you people are actively making choices that lead to losses.

So don’t fear the 90% - understand it. The failure rate isn’t a prophecy. It’s a filter. If you commit to mastering the craft, you’re already doing what most never even attempt.

P.S. I used 90% for reference, but the range is usually given among 85-98%, however, it doesn't change the message.",108,64,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1kjm51a/90_of_traders_fail_but_the_statistics_dont_tell/,all,Discussion,0.91

2. Do NOT trade premarket gainers with no news – These are your classic pump and dumps.
3. Do NOT trade stocks below the 20/50 Moving Averages – Stocks that are below the 20/50 MAs are full of bull traps and typically continues to drop further down.
4. Do NOT trade breakouts before confirmation – Do not enter a stock once it breaks a key level. Instead, wait until the price action validates the breakout.

1. Poor back support
2. Ignoring orange juice futures

Let’s start with the spine. You're trying to hold your positions, but your posture can’t even hold neutral bias. Your lower back is in a permanent drawdown. You think you're overleveraged in tech? Try overextending your lumbar every time you lean into the screen to scalp SPY.

I upgraded to a chair with proper lumbar support and my trading improved instantly. I stopped panic selling. My breathing stabilized. I held through earnings. Coincidence?

Now, let’s talk about the real market mover: orange juice futures. Quiet. Underappreciated. But a better volatility indicator than VIX and a better hedge than gold. Ask yourself - when’s the last time you checked the OJ chart before placing a trade? Never? That’s why you’re down.

It’s not about your win rate.

What do I mean by cut losses fast? Suppose I am trading nasdaq100 on mt4, I will wait until market open, then as the market opens I will see where the liquidity is flowing and I will enter in thr same direction, if it goes against me (in loss) I’ll immediately exist, if it turns back I will just re enter no fuss.


How about exit? What does let profit run? If you your trade is in 100$ profit, then suddenly it pulls back 50-60%, then this does not mean you letting profit run, lol, you just lost fucking 50%. The idea is to maximize profit in the shortest time possible.

I know most of you are likely trading a $50K prop account, and thinking you can trade 5 Mini's and keep blowing accounts.  
On those 50K funded accounts, you should be trading 2-3 MICROS MAX.  
You should be able to take 10 losses in a row and have it not blow you up. Give your strategy time to work for you, it can't work for you if 3 losses means you're account is done. Place those stop losses as wide as they should be, which won't scare you if you are sized properly.

You then don't size up after you have made $1,000. You need to EARN sizing up, by proving at least 6 months of profitability and building a cushion to again be at a spot where 7-10 losses in a row doesn't blow your account up.

This helped me a lot, it's not sexy, its SLOW progress, but it's what you need to do. Size down, be happy with +$200 days and stick to your rules.

1ngw28u,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 12:40:40,Why does it take many years to become profitable with trading?,"Hi traders. Im still quite new to trading (trading for only 6 months now). And before i get into this question, I am not claiming to be profitable or nearly there yet, I just wanna know what it takes.

Why does it take most people 3+ years to be profitable when trading is said to be better when it is simplified? In my eyes, the main things you need to be successful are: 

\- A strategy that has been extensively backtested that is proven to work

\- Good risk management

\- The psychological aspect of trading where you objectively follows the rules of your trading plan and not let your emotions impact how you execute and manage trades.

The way i see it: finding a working strategy with good risk management shouldnt take too long if you have enough time. A strategy can be backtested over 12 months within 2 days of being on fxreplay. so theoretically if you have time to you could backtest around 10 strategy variations a month. Forward testing can happen as time goes by.

I understand for some the psychology aspect may take a while to master, but lets say that someone has little emotional decision making from the start and has a vast understanding that trading involves losing as well, you just need a good RR, even though your win rate is less than 50%.

  
Taking into account all the above, I dont see why it cant take someone about a year to become profitable?

I am not responsible for the strategy's performance in the future or in your case, nor do I guarantee its profitability on your instruments. Any decisions you make are entirely at your own risk*

This is my first post about strategies, so this time we will consider the simplest strategy.

# Idea

[RSI ](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/relative-strength-index)is the most popular and effective indicator.

* **Trend filter** (RSI> 50.0 is uptrend)
* **The pullbacks indicator** (if the trend is strong and RSI is low, then the price has probably already completed the pullback)

This well-known strategy uses the RSI(2) with the smallest possible period to enter trade during a price pullback. This generates more entry points, and therefore more trades, more profits.

You can experiment with parameters as much as you like, almost any set of parameters yields profits, so it’s easy to build a portfolio.

# Strategy

* **Instrument**: US100 Index (Or NQ)
* **TF**: 1D (*The strategy does not work on time frames below.)*
* **Initial Capital:** 10k$
* **Risked Money**: 500$
* **Data Period**: 2012.01.19 - 2024.11.28

*The strategy buys only if there are no open trades. That is, there can be only 1 trade at a time.*  
*The strategy does not have a shortsell trades as instrument is often in the uptrend*

***Inputs:***

1. Period - **2**/3/4
2. Low - 10/15/**25**/35
3. High - 90/85/**75**/65

**Buy Rule:** RSI(Period) < Low  
*You can add a trend filter. This will reduce the number of trends, but protect against bad periods of strategy*

**Close Rule**: RSI(Period) > High. Exit on friday. Exit after 30 days.  
*You can experiment with the close rule: select another indicator, period, a certain price level, day or just close at the first successful closing of the price (close of candlestick > buy price)*

Since it is a [Mean Reversion](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/mean-reversion) strategy:  
**I do not recommend using the Stop Loss** option as it increases the drawdown and reduces the profit.  
**I don’t recommend using Take Profit** as it reduces profits.

# Conclusions

1. The strategy has clearly bad periods during the downtrend. Some years have been unsuccessful because of this.
2. On the other hand, almost every year of successful trades more than 80%.
3. An average of 20 trades per year, which is about 2 each month.
4. As I close deals on Friday, Friday is the worst day.
5. The average length of a trade is 5.5
6. Monte Carlo failed, probably because of the mean reliable type of strategy

1mrc4om,2025-08-15,2025-08-15 18:12:28,Trading isn't about mastering your emotions.,"
I've been following this subreddit for awhile now and seems like every week I see some post talking about how trading is all about mastering your emotions.

If you are feeling all sorts of emotions while trading it's your mind reacting to the fact that you don't know what your are doing. You haven't done the work. You haven't put in the time. Your emotions are the symptom not the problem.

Feeling fomo and the urge to chase an extended stock?
That's just a misunderstanding of risk to reward. An extended stock isn't tempting to me because the risk to reward is terrible and nothing about that chart entices me. The reason I don't chase is because the chart looks like shit, not because I've meditated and mastered my emotions. My emotion in that moment is aligned with my system. I feel the setup sucks and I move on.

Feeling greedy and want to extend your profit target? Did you ever actually back test your system against your setups?
I know most of my trades don't go past 3ATR , I don't feel any emotion or random urge to move my target. I know my target is good because I've spent hundreds of hours building a backtester and testing different ideas across 5 years of setups. I don't feel anything. I just put in my order and move on.

Trading is a skill and the more skilled you get the more your emotions will align with your trading naturally. The need to repress or fight urges that go against your strategy will go away.

If you break your sell rules due to emotion rather then sitting around telling yourself to be mentally stronger, do some actual work. Study your sell rules, backtest them, backtest other variants.",97,66,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1mrc4om/trading_isnt_about_mastering_your_emotions/,all,Discussion,0.89

lobdxm,2021-02-20,2021-02-20 12:02:52,Preparing to day trade full time,"Most rookie traders have it entirely wrong when it comes to day trading the market full time. Becoming consistently profitable isn't actually hard at all. You just need to approach it from the other end.

You may have been swayed into day trading by some stock market ""guru"" friend who brainwashed you into chasing hyped up meme stocks and pump and dump penny stocks. You were probably told that day trading is the easiest thing in the world and you can do it from your kitchen table with your pink-striped boxers on.  Then you even got lucky with GME and are now confident enough to strike the next coup. How many times are you able to repeat it without getting crushed ultimately?

If you've gotten off the wrong foot with trading early on, this may serve as a gentle reintroduction:

Firstly, you have to get accustomed to the idea that markets don't move fast at all. Forget the 5- minute time frame for a while. Secondly, you zoom out to the weekly or the monthly chart. You will start to see the forest for the trees.

A rookie seeks thrills. His day job is so boring that he prefers to squander hard-earned savings. Or life is so miserable that taking chances is far more favorable than enduring it. If that's what you're after, go ahead, I won't stop you.

A professional seeks profits, and systems that will yield profits consistently. If you are inexperienced, how could you possibly start with day trading? Day trading is hard. Start with something that's easy and gives you motivation to improve.

Get used to a time frame that's more manageable for you. Look at the weekly chart and observe what the market is doing. Has it been rising in the past 6 months? Has it been dropping? Where did the trend reverse and how could you have spotted it? Trade a smaller position until you really have a competitive edge.

This is a marathon, not a sprint. You're here to survive first and foremost and then to thrive. So I ask you again: are you seeking thrills or profits?

Find universal rules that have been applicable across market conditions. If you can't find them, keep looking because you eventually will. I have been applying the same rules for over a decade and they still work the same like on the first day.

Once you gain experience and consistency with larger time frames, you can start to narrow down to shorter time frames, and possibly even day trading. Doing it in reverse is pretty much equivalent to performing neurosurgery on the first day of your dental internship.",96,26,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/lobdxm/preparing_to_day_trade_full_time/,all,Unknown,0.96

1. Built a real routine Same wake-up, same prep, same shutdown. Once I started treating trading like a job instead of a gamble, things started to click.
2. Started journaling everything Not just the trades, but why I took them, how I felt, and what rules I broke (or followed). I use tradezella to track everything, and it’s helped me catch patterns I wasn’t seeing before.
3. Stopped trading what I didn't plan. If I didn’t plan the setup before the session started, I wouldn't take trades. helped me avoid forcing anything.
4. Redefined what a “win” means If I followed my rules all day, even with no trades, that’s a win. If I made money but broke my rules, it’s not. Shifting how I measure success changed everything.
5. Focused on execution over PnL. I stopped caring about the daily dollar amount and started grading myself on how well I followed my plan.
6. Review every week with honesty Once a week, I go through my trades, my mindset, and the decisions I made, not just the outcomes. It keeps me accountable and focused on improvement.

1m0tdc3,2025-07-15,2025-07-15 16:48:41,What is ATR and Why I love Using It,"Years ago, I used to get so frustrated testing my strategies because of what I call the *freeze effect*. If you’ve been trading for any amount of time, I’m willing to bet you know exactly what I mean.

Your setup appears. All the boxes are checked. But now you're stuck — trying to calculate position size. By the time you’ve figured it out, the move’s already gone.

That’s when I discovered the **Average True Range (ATR)**.

ATR does exactly what it sounds like: it measures the **average true range** of a stock — a clean, effective proxy for volatility.

Let me give you two extremes:

* **$AXON** has an ATR of **29.75**
* **$SPY** has an ATR of **4.49**

Both trade at similar price levels, but AXON is about **6x more volatile**. That matters.

Why? Because a volatile stock needs **room to breathe**.

Let’s say you use a $10 stop loss. That might work fine on SPY, but on AXON, it’ll likely get hit quickly — not because your setup was wrong, but because the stop didn’t match the volatility. So even if you’re risking the same 1% on a $100K account, **you’d get stopped out \~6x faster** on AXON, on average.

But here’s where it gets interesting:  
If I size my stop **based on ATR** — let’s say **1.5x ATR** — I give my trade room to work **regardless of the ticker**. Now, all I need to figure out is how many shares to buy.

Here’s the formula I use:

    Shares = (Account Size × Risk %) / (ATR × Multiplier)

Example:  
You have a $100K account, willing to risk 1% ($1,000), and XYZ has an ATR of $10.

If you use a 1.5x ATR stop:

    Shares = 1,000 / (1.5 × 10) = 1,000 / 15 ≈ 66 shares

You’d buy 66 shares and set a $15 stop loss. Now the position is tuned to the stock’s volatility.

I personally use **ThinkorSwim**, and I’ve coded a simple script that adds a label on my charts showing me the exact share count to buy. No more freezing. No more second-guessing.

1frciev,2024-09-28,2024-09-28 07:47:56,Would you say that trading is 90% emotional control ,"I don’t know about how everyone else feels but in my opinion, becoming a profitable trader comes down to how well you can manage emotions and some form of technical analysis.

I would say that you can learn how to trade in roughly around 1-3 months, all charts really do is the same thing on repeat. They trend upwards or downwards or consolidate based on fundamentals over a long term basis. On an intraday basis they target areas of liquidity in order to move onwards with the trend. However learning how to control emotions can take 1-5 years depending on the person I would say.

Realistically you can learn a strategy in about 3 months, let’s say support and resistance. All strategies work and you could be profitable by just following this model consistently.

The reason why 95% of people fail is because they are too focused on the money side of trading. Once you detach from that you become profitable. Literally all trading is buying or selling based on fundamentals or some form of trend analysis. 

For example why trade these stupid trades everyday on gold (xau/usd) with 20-50 pip stop losses when gold has gone up over 7000 pips in the last year. Study the reason why things move a war, politics and banking. Just focus on the trend and forget the emotions or really you are just creating stress and losses for nothing - this is why the majority of the time you are ‘correct’ but still lose, because reading charts is actually fairly easy.

This in my opinion is why trading is an amazing hobby, as it teaches you everything about yourself. To become a trader you have to become enlightened and the master of your own mind.

The plan is straightforward, build a $15K cushion from trading profits alone before leaving my job. That gives me a full year of living expenses covered:

• $2,760 for rent ($230 x 12 months)
• $4,560 for my salary ($380 x 12 months)

I’m already accustomed to living lean and making ~$238/month at my current job, so survival isn’t the issue. The first three months after leaving won’t even be focused on trading. They’ll be about decompressing, appreciating life, and recharging before going all-in.

That’s it. No overcomplication, no delusion, just a base, a buffer, and time.

1mpenaj,2025-08-13,2025-08-13 15:50:32,Beginner here – Want to learn trading from scratch. How should I start?,"Hey everyone,

I’m completely new to trading, but I’m serious about learning it the right way from day one. My goal is to build strong fundamentals, discipline, and a sustainable trading routine so I can eventually trade profitably and independently. I’m not looking for “get-rich-quick” tips — I want to treat this like a skill and profession.

Here’s what I’m looking for guidance on:

1. Where to start as a complete beginner:
	•	Should I begin with Forex, Stocks, Crypto, or something else?
	•	How to choose a broker/platform as a beginner?
	•	How much capital should I realistically start with for learning?

2. Lifestyle & mindset changes:
	•	Daily habits or routines that help traders stay disciplined and focused
	•	Managing emotions, avoiding revenge trading, and dealing with losses
	•	Time management for someone who can dedicate 1–2 hours/day on weekdays and more on weekends

3. Learning resources:
	•	Best beginner-friendly books that actually helped you
	•	YouTube channels, websites, or courses worth following
	•	Practice methods (e.g., demo trading, backtesting, paper trading)

4. Skills to focus on first:
	•	Price action vs indicators — which to learn first?
	•	Risk management strategies that work in real life
	•	How to build and stick to a trading plan

5. Common beginner mistakes:
	•	What traps should I avoid early on?
	•	Things you wish you knew when starting out

Extra context:
I’m ready to commit to a daily routine and make lifestyle changes if needed. I’m more interested in long-term consistent profits rather than quick wins.

If you could go back to your very first month of learning trading, what exact steps would you follow?

1mc3tfg,2025-07-29,2025-07-29 02:08:56,How do you actually learn trading? Guide to those who are looking into trading.,"Hi, 

I’m a pro trader who have been in this business for 7+ years and over the years I have seen many traders come and go and many become profitable and many more amount huge losses and wreck their lives. 

I’m here to share some tips of how to go about trading so it can work for you. 

- start trading with 0 capital the first 2 years, strictly. No matter how intuitive and easy it feels, trust me you are going to lose your capital no matter what. Trading requires you to know the market so well that even if you miss a single factor you will lose money in the market and even when you know everything to be profitable, you will still have market losses. 

- learn from books, PDFs, YouTube videos. Stay away from indicators as they make you a lazy analyst, study price action and key levels from traders online who share them on YouTube. (Stay away from ICT as well). This is a lot of fun. If you’re curious by nature, there is so much information you come across (but it helps to have a bu*****t meter) as many traders chat nonsense. Even the so called experts. No one is an expert when it comes to the market, not even someone like Jesse Livermore, market is always your best teacher. 

- pick a mentor who has a good understanding of the market, someone who has taught traders before and can guide you to become profitable. This will cost you a few upfront but you have a good guidance and much easier to learn as you also gain the mentor’s trading experience of do’s and dont’s which you can avoid. Saves time and trading money (in huge losses) but costs tuition. The whole experience of learning how to analyse and trade becomes comfortable when you’re lucky to choose the right mentor for you. Comfortable in the sense, s/he guides you when you make mistakes in analysis, when your thought process is wrong as you take trades, your blind spots can be seen, psychological help, and so on. Again, this is only an option. A good one at that. 

Regardless of what you do, DO NOT risk money until you have at least 1 profitable month in technical analysis or fundamental analysis - and every trade is “analysed” and not just entered without analysing. I can’t stress this enough - anyone can make money in the market as it’s just a simple buy or sell but staying consistent requires skill. 

Trading income is directly correlated to your skill. It’s a skill based income and not otherwise. Until you become highly skilled in this business you can never ever stay profitable. Do not listen to anyone, not your brokers, not the internet, not your friends or family members, trust that - trading is highly risky (especially if you have a gambling mindset) and you will lose all your savings if you do not invest into learning it as a skill. And as every skill it takes years to obtain - to learn what happens in the market would only take you 1-3 months (if you learn the right stuff) but as any skill goes - it’s experience that will make you money, and that requires years of experience in market. You get different types of market behaviour over the years and that teaches you a lot more than anyone can. 

Again, trading will take you minimum 3 years. If you have psychological issues it will 100% take you longer. Sometimes even 5-6 years. This is the truth. I hope this helps all. Know what you’re getting into and don’t risk your rent money. 

Thanks! 

PS - expect you to have a spiritual journey if you’re lucky. Trading isn’t just numbers and money and analytical skill. ",88,44,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1mc3tfg/how_do_you_actually_learn_trading_guide_to_those/,all,Due-diligence,0.94
1lij0kg,2025-06-23,2025-06-23 11:06:41,The stuff that actually made me a consistent trader,"Everyone’s always talking about indicators, secret setups, or the newest “holy grail” strategy.

But honestly, none of that helped me get consistent.

Here’s what *actually* made a difference for me:

**1. Consistency > Strategy**

You can have a profitable strategy with a 70% win rate, but if you only stick to it half the time, it doesn’t matter. You’re just winging it at that point.

What helped me: I made a super simple checklist for entries, exits, and risk. If a trade didn’t check every box, I passed on it. No exceptions.

**2. Journaling Changed the Game**

At first I thought journaling was overrated. Now it’s probably the most valuable thing I do.

It keeps me honest and gives me actual data to improve. I log:

* Why I took the trade
* How I felt before/during/after
* What the market looked like
* What I’d change next time

After 30–50 trades, patterns really start to show themselves.

**3. Risk Management Isn’t Just a % Rule**

It’s more than “don’t risk more than 2%.” Real risk management is knowing how hot your account is running, adjusting to volatility, and not letting one trade wreck your week.

Now I have daily loss caps and I reduce size after a drawdown. It keeps me in the game.

**4. Focus on the Process, Not the P&L**

Every time I get too fixated on profits, I overtrade or second guess myself.

Now I track how well I followed my plan. I can’t control outcomes, but I *can* control execution.

A clean loss doesn’t bother me anymore. A sloppy win does.

**5. Stick to One Setup at First**

Trying to trade everything (breakouts, reversals, different products, etc.) had me all over the place.

I got consistent once I picked *one* product, *one* time frame, and *one* setup, and just drilled it. Simpler = better.

**6. Track the Right Stuff**

I started tracking more than just wins/losses:

* Win %
* Avg win vs avg loss
* Time of day I do best/worst
* How often I break rules

That’s the kind of stuff that actually gives you direction and helps scale up.

**7. Psychology Is the Final Boss**

Impulse trades, revenge trades, hesitation... it’s all in your head.

It’s not about “having more discipline” it’s about setting up systems so you don’t need to constantly rely on willpower.

I started:

* Limiting screen time
* Planning every session in advance
* Using hard loss limits
* Focusing on process wins, not just money

At the end of the day, the real edge isn’t some secret indicator.

It’s having a clear process, sticking to it, learning from your data, and not letting your brain sabotage you.",87,36,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1lij0kg/the_stuff_that_actually_made_me_a_consistent/,all,Advice,0.94

Let me help you.,"If you're reading this post because you're in desperate need of help trying to recover extreme financial loss from trading. You've come to the right place, as I know the exact strategy that will help you recover your funds, prevent further losses, and make some serious profit. It's a very simple step-by-step method. I call it ""The Mattegy Strategy"" named after me, Matt.

It goes like this:

Step 1. Get a job you idiot. 

Step 2. Maintain budgeting spreadsheets and put money away in savings.

Step 3. Stop gambling: 

You call it trading, but what you're doing is gambling. Traders use risk management and analysis to minimize losses and maximise gains. Guess what, you did neither and you lost thousands of dollars because you're a gambler. Trading is not a machine where you throw $25,000 at and you become a millionaire overnight you dummy. Seek professional help if you need to.

Step 4. Read a book:  
  
Honestly, if you're stupid enough to throw $25k that you can't afford to lose at something you don't understand and don't know what to do when you've lost all that money, you're all kinds of stupid.   
Think about it, that's the price of a decent car, you're literally as stupid as somebody who doesn't know anything about operating a car, road rules or safety, buying a car and then driving it into the most hectic traffic.  
You need an education. So read some books you idiot, then you'll gain intelligence to prevent further stupidity from occuring.

1k7hj6x,2025-04-25,2025-04-25 06:23:28,Jim Simons: The Mathematician Who Quietly Beat the Markets,"**Today**, April 25, would have been **Jim Simons’ 87th birthday**. Y'all probably already know him. But, for those who don't...

Simons, also known as the Quant King, was not a typical investor. He was a mathematician who founded the quant fund Renaissance Technologies, the firm behind the Medallion Fund. Over 30 years, Medallion delivered around **66 percent annual returns before fees** and **39 percent after fees**!

[Image credits to simonsfoundation.org](https://preview.redd.it/2d1xfx70jywe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d9f33eeaa02ea9aff2ef697c615e18ea5f5b3e0)

Many academics promote the efficient market hypothesis - the idea that markets reflect all available information and cannot be consistently outperformed. Simons and his team showed that this is not entirely true.

They used **statistics, computing and historical data** to find patterns in market behavior. These patterns had little to do with news and nothing to do with gut instinct, instead their approach focused on quantitative research, model building, and rigorous testing. Their main advantage came from the depth of their research, not from plain automation or high-speed trading.

Eventually, the fund became **so profitable they stopped taking outside capital** and ran it only for employees. Simons rarely spoke about his work, and Renaissance kept its methods private. But his results spoke for themselves. He went on to donate a significant portion of his wealth to **charitable causes, including education and mathematics research**.

\----

Happy birthday to Jim Simons, the man who brought science and quant techniques into finance and quietly transformed the way markets are understood. His team single handedly debunked the EMH, and showed that with the right tools, structure can be found beneath the randomness and noise.

Here is how he summarized his life: 

*""I did a lot of math. I made a lot of money, and I gave almost all of it away. That's the story of my life.""*

1kb52vj,2025-04-29,2025-04-29 21:50:34,One Thing I Wish I Knew Before I Started Trading,"Hello Traders**,** 

Polished by yours truly Chat GPT:) anyway

I’ve been trading pretty seriously for the past 3–4 months, and I’ve learned a tremendous amount—about both the markets and myself. Sometimes I think back and wonder why it took me so long to figure this out. I’m hoping that others who are trading can see this for themselves too.

When I first started learning about trading, I jumped from one idea to another, constantly searching for the “answer.” I spent months reading and consuming content but wasn’t really getting anywhere. In fact, most of it just ended up contradicting how I think about trading.

Maybe this doesn’t apply as much if you’re an algo or purely systematic trader, but I genuinely wish I had spent less time reading and more time actually trading. And no—I’m not talking about endless paper trading either. I mean putting real skin in the game, even without a perfect edge. You need to place trades. You need to feel what it’s like to win and lose. You need to experience slippage, bid-ask spread, and the emotions that come with it.

Yes, you’ll probably lose a good chunk—if not all—of your money at first. But that risk can be dramatically reduced with solid risk management. The time you spend *in* the market builds real experience and discretion, which is something no “TJR order block” strategy can teach you.

Once you’ve built that base of live experience, *then* you’ll start to understand how and when to implement different strategies you read about.

One thing that still baffles me: why is every social media trader pushing systematic rules like “when this happens, do this every time”? Unless you’re a coding wizard or a math genius, discretion will be your best friend in this game.

Anyway, just a bit of a rant. I’m still relatively new myself, but I’ve spent a year or two reading and getting nowhere—until I actually started trading. I’m not saying to go dump your money into a broker account and YOLO it. But at the very least, come in with some basic risk management and get in the arena.

Hope this helps a newer trader out there and leave your thoughts experienced traders.",90,41,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1kb52vj/one_thing_i_wish_i_knew_before_i_started_trading/,all,Discussion,0.92

pj4gk1,2021-09-06,2021-09-06 13:47:54,Ten Steps to Get Started as a Short-Term (Day/Swing) Trader,"I keep seeing this specific question -

*I have $1K/$2K/$5 and I want to be a trader, how do I get started?*

Most new traders focus on using Options, but unfortunately they tend to jump right in.  Obviously if you are already an experienced trader than this post would not be for you.

I've been a successful trader for several years now (meaning I can count on consistent profits as a salary each month) and it has become clear to me that so many new short-term traders have been lured into this field under false pretenses.  So while many of my posts are focused on specific strategies, or upcoming stock plays, I thought it would be helpful to write one that focused on the basics.

I am going to write out -this out step-by-step - these apply whether you are starting with $1k, $5K, $25K or $100K:

**1)** ***Choose A Broker*** \- Stay away from any mobile only broker, you want one that you can use on your laptop, has a good trading platform (I like *ThinkorSwim*, but *Interactive Brokers*, *TradeStation*, *Fidelity*, etc are all fine, it just depends on what matters most to you, so do your research).  Deposit your money and make sure you are able to trade Options and qualify for margin.  You also want a broker that allows you to use a Paper Trading account in *real-time -* this is essential (*ThinkorSwim is excellent for this capability)*.  As to why you want margin - simple - it is very difficult to be a consistently profitable trader without it (not impossible, just more difficult).

**2)** ***Learn*** \- Before you make a single real trade, you need to learn.  A lot.  This can take months.  Most brokers offer free online courses for you to take.  There are also plenty of books out there (*Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets* by John Murphy, *How to Make Money in Stocks* by William O'Neil, *Options as a Strategic Investment* by Lawrence McMillian, *Trading in the Zone* by Mark Douglas, etc.) and plenty of videos that are purely educational (i.e. not trying to sell you something).  Soak up everything.  This is where you want to use your Paper Trading account.  As you learn how to trade, especially Options, try it out using the Paper account set to *Real Time*. It is also important that you not put an unrealistic amount of fake money into this account.  It should be similar to the actual amount you will be starting with in your real portfolio. At this point you are just trying to get a handle on how to trade the following:

**a) Stocks** \- fairly basic, but learn how to buy and sell stocks (going long and shorting).  And while most advanced traders use mental stops, as a beginner you will be using real ones, so also learn how to set them, including OCO brackets.

**b) Options** \- since most of you are not starting with a lot of capital, chances are you will be trading options a great deal.  Make sure you learn everything you can about Option trading before you ever spend one dime of real money making an Options trade.  So many new traders lose their money playing Options without really understanding the instrument.  Part of studying Options include learning the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, and Theta are the ones you will mainly use).   Understand how premiums work, and what IV does to the price of your Options (particularly during *events* like earnings or company announcements).  There is also a lot of enthusiasm around the idea of ""selling premium"" - which while an excellent method of generating income, can also be very dangerous if you do not know what you are doing.

**c) Option Spreads** \- correctly using Option spreads are the best way to grow an account below $25K.  They are also one of the more difficult things to master.  So spend a lot of time on these. The Options Playbook website is filled with information and as you will see - there are *many different types of spreads*.  I suggest getting most familiar with *Call Debit, Put Debit, Call Credit, Put Credit, Diagonals, Covered Calls,* and *Poor Mans Covered Calls.*  Using these strategies can both mitigate your risk while keeping your returns at a respectable level.

**3)** ***Analysis -*** Up until now you should have been getting comfortable with the basics, but probably without much direction on how to choose the right stocks, when to enter and when to exit them.  This is where *Technical Analysis* comes in.  All of short-term trading is based on *Technical Analysis*.  Long-term investing is focused primarily on *Fundamental* analysis, but as a short-term trader (meaning you are holding for less than two weeks, and usually for less that two days) you really do not care what the fundamentals are behind the company you are trading.  If you are holding a position for a few hours or a few days, it doesn't really matter to you what their P/E ratio is, or how their future outlook was last reported.  What does matter are the charts.  You need to learn how to read the candlestick patterns, which indicators are useful (and which ones are crap), how to read the market, and of course, how to finds the right stocks.  *Technical Analysis* works because there is widespread consensus on it.  Meaning, if all traders, retail and institutions, believe that a price level is acting as *support* for a stock, they will act accordingly.  This part of your journey is probably going to be the most difficult to master - in fact, you will continue to learn and get better at it as you go along.  Every great trader never stops being a student of analysis, and neither should you.

**4)**  ***Choose a good scanner -*** All this knowledge is not going to help if you cannot find the right stocks.  Most brokers come with decent scanners built into their platforms, and there are a number of free scanners available as well.  There are also a number of scanners out there that cost money, some of them are very good, while others are of questionable quality.  I have ones I recommend, but there are many out there that give you great stocks to trade every day.  Keep in mind, if you are looking to Day Trade than you are scanning on a much shorter time-frame then if you were Swing Trading.  By now you should have a good idea of what you want to scan for as well.  Most people will tell you to look for huge jumps in volume, which is always an important factor, but that mainly applies to *Momentum Trading*, **which you should be avoiding**.  You do want stocks that have high Relative Volume, but you also want stocks that are strong/weak to the market, have high liquidity, have a ""buy"" signal (whether it is a 3/8 cross on the EMA's, or a breach of consolidation, breaking through *resistance/support,* there are many different scenarios that qualify here).  These scanners should also help you create *Watchlists* and set alerts on charts so when a stock meets the criteria you have set you will get notified of it.  Going through charts and placing *alert lines* are a huge part of being a short-term trader.

**5)** ***Choose a Journal*** **-** The three most popular are *Tradersync, Tradervue* and *Edgewonk.*  Whichever one you choose, make sure at the end of each day while paper trading you upload your trades to the journals and look at your statistics.  You want to focus on your win rate, profit vs. loss, and the types of trades you do well at, as well as the ones you tend to lose the most on.  Categories like *Type of Stock (price, market cap level, volume, etc.), Time of Day/Week, Trade size, Type of trade (Long, Short, Option Spread, etc.)* are all important to note and study.

***These first five steps should take you at least six months.  Which means several months where you have not yet made a single trade using real money.  And you will be tempted - particularly as you start seeing trades in your paper account making huge returns.  Don't do it.  Until your win rate is at least over 60%, do not make a real trade.***

**6)** ***Choose a Strategy -***  Now that you have a good understanding of how to trade, and you have a decent amount of data in your online journal to see what is working for you, it is time to choose a strategy.  There are many strategies to choose from (I primarily use Relative Strength/Weakness against SPY, which may sound like RSI and/or Beta, but it is very different from those indicators, neither of which I use or put much stock in) but there is *one strategy you should* ***not*** *use - Momentum trading.  Especially Momentum trading low-float stocks.*  This method of trading is unfortunately what lures most traders into this field to begin with (countless YouTube videos promising you that you can get rich doing it) and it *seems so easy.  This type of trading is one of the most difficult strategies one can choose, and should only be done by people who are* ***very*** *experienced.*  There will be many people tell you about how much money they made or are making with *momentum trades*, most of which will try to convince you that they discovered some method that assures you of high level of profits.  *Don't listen to them.  Someone who is getting lucky for a few months is not the same as having a consistently profitable method that* ***you can count on***.

**7)** ***Decide on a Community -*** Many people prefer to trade alone, excel at it even.  For me it was fine, but I much preferred trading in a good community.  However, there are many scams out there.  But if you are going to join a group, make sure you choose a service that:

**a)** is not focused solely or mainly on *Momentum trading*. Most of them are.  You want a community that teaches a full 360 approach to trading.

**b)** has pros in it.  People that actually do this for a living.  And make sure they are accessible.

**c)** has an active live discussion.  This part is essential.  You want to be in a room that isn't a free-for-all, but rather focused on trading and led by actual professionals.  The ones that are mainly composed of amateurs throwing out trades all the time can actually hurt your trading.

**d)** is filled with resources.  Any community you choose that is worth joining will probably cost you some money, so make sure they have useful resources, including scanners, platforms and educational content.

**8)** ***Start Trading -*** Now that you have chosen your broker, learned the basic of trading, understand technical analysis, found a really good scanner, used to journal to help you choose which strategies you want to focus on, and decided on whether or not you want to be in a community - you are ready to trade.  ***Start small***.  I can not emphasize this enough.  If you have $2,000, then you are looking to perhaps do an Option Spread that costs $1.50 ($150) per contract and maybe do 2 contracts.  You want to buy just one In-The-Money Call or Put (Delta of .6 or higher) on a solid stock.  The key to being successful is *consistency* and that means hitting *singles*, not *homeruns*.  If you have $2,000 in your account and make $50 in a day, that is a 2.5% return, which is excellent.  Learn to be ok with slowly growing your account.  As your skill level increases, so will your profits - don't worry, in time it will come - but for now, settle for the small wins.

**9)** ***Set Goals -*** Trading for a living is a business.  Treat it like one.  Set your monthly goals.  While you should not focus on your P&L while trading (meaning you do not exit a trade because you are down or up a certain amount of money, but rather because the analysis tells you to exit) you *should* focus on you account balance in terms of the salary you need to live off day-to-day.   It is important to realize that if you reach your monthly goals on win rate, number of trades a day and profit per trade, you will also reach your monthly profit target as well.  Remember the ultimate goal here is that at the end of each month you are going to be taking out the profit (this is your salary) and leaving the base behind.  By the time you reach this step you should have a really good idea what type of profit you can expect from your strategy, and base amount in the account.

**10)** ***Get an Accountant -*** Some people can do this themselves (I am not one of those people), but you want to make sure you are using the best possible set-up to pay the least amount of taxes.  Do you qualify for Day Trader status with the IRS?  Are you trading out of an IRA? Are you using an LLC or S-Corp? Since this is going to be your business, make sure you have your financials in order.

So there you go.

Why do most people fail at short-term trading?  Simple - they do not do any of these steps.  They deposit money, try to scalp low float gappers or buy a lot of options on the hot MEME stock. Eventually after losing enough money, they quit. ***That is why most short-term traders lose money.***

*If one follows these steps, it should take roughly two years before you can expect to be consistently profitable.  Even after doing the first five steps, you will lose when you start trading with real money.  But if you are* ***trading small*** *like I suggest, it won't blow-up your account.*

I know nobody wants to hear that it will take that long to get good at this.  But think of it this way - how much time, energy and money does one put into getting a job and working their way up to middle management?  Years of school.  More years of eating shit at a bunch of crappy jobs, working yourself to the bone to get promoted.  All for what?  A bigger cubicle? A VP title at a company that will fire you the moment they need to make ""cuts""?  To have bosses that don't know what they are doing?

***Trading for a living gives you financial freedom.***  The ability to make money no matter where you are, as long as there is an internet connection.  No boss.  Just you and the market.  **Having that life is worth the time and effort.** And I can tell you, it is great.  It is exactly as you would imagine it to be.  

***As a professional Day Trader and I could not imagine doing anything else.***

So I urge you - if you are trying to figure out how to get started - do this the right way - there are no shortcuts.

1frep7j,2024-09-28,2024-09-28 09:48:39,ATR is a Game Changer.😭,"https://preview.redd.it/ofbqak9y0krd1.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=48e258520cfb6476a03270c6f1d870185048a56b

I wasn't sure if people actually use ATR in their trading, but I've found it to be an excellent indicator. For years, I ignored it because I didn’t understand it at all, but it has completely transformed my trading strategy. Now, I use ATR in a simple way: I only trade when the ATR is very low, indicating low volatility in the market. This is when the market tends to stagnate, and my stop-loss remains intact due to the tight price movements.

When bars turn yellow it is a sign for me to get ready, lock on into the chart and set the alert for my Algoninja Reversal Confirmation. (just a custom indicator i built)  
I read an article in QuantMinds 2020, it is a special event where Banks and Other Algorithmic Traders or Quant Experts gather to discuss different approaches and scientific stuff about the market. And also it is the world's leading quant finance event.

The One speaker from that event said ""As the tick value gets lower, more trades become informed; as the tick value gets higher, more trades become noise...Well, volatility should play a role; after all, the more volatile an asset is, the more the price will change, leading to faster price changes and a wider range of prices over a trading day.""-Marcos Costa Santos Carreira

This blew my mind away and instantly experimented on how to read volatility. I am not a quant, and I am just a normal trader like you who wants to find answers in the market. I think this is a huge leap for me discovering these unknown stuff. If you are a trader who also use ATR, I will be glad to know your insights on how you use it. Thank you🤗

I’m a trader who’s been using ChatGPT as part of my daily routine — not for signals or strategies, but to sharpen my psychology and decision-making.

Over time, I started writing prompts that help me reduce FOMO, reflect on bad trades, and improve consistency. Here are 3 that have helped me a lot:


---

Prompt 1:
“Act as my trading psychologist. Ask me 3 questions to calm me before I enter a trade.”

Prompt 2:
“Help me review this journal entry and identify emotional triggers or decision flaws.”

Prompt 3:
“Ask me a risk-checklist before I place my next trade.”

These simple prompts keep me grounded — especially when I feel impulsive or overconfident. I’ve now built a full set of 100+ prompts for psychology, planning, journaling, and more.

lg6vl3,2021-02-09,2021-02-09 11:21:16,"Technical Analysis Series (3): Move it, Move it, Moving Averages","Hey Traders!

This post is the third installment of my technical analysis educational series and will serve as an introduction to moving averages.  Please see my profile if you missed the prior installments on candle stick formations and horizontal support/resistance levels.

Moving averages provide the technical trader with reference points on an asset to help identify critical support/resistance levels and changes in trend. Furthermore, moving average analysis and how they interact with the price action of the asset and each other can become extremely nuanced. Depending on what type of trading I'm currently trying to do (scalping, swing trading, macro trend) I run up to 11 different moving averages at a time. Getting into the minutia of an entire trading system like that is well beyond the intended scope of this post, but I wanted to highlight the vast potential and adaptability of moving averages for the more serious traders out there.  Lastly, discussing moving averages unavoidably gets into some ""mathy"" territory, which I tried to gloss over and explain as simply as possible. My apologies if anyone gets a glassy look in their eyes and has flashbacks to Junior year of High School.

**What is a Moving Average?**

A moving average is a calculation to analyze data points by creating a series of averages that becomes a moving/rolling mean. As the moving average ""rolls forward"" the old data is removed from the data set and the new price data is incorporated. For example, the 200 Day simple moving average is the average of the most recent 200 days of price action. As time moves forward the oldest data is removed from the moving average.  One of the main benefits to move averages is that it smooths out the price action thereby reducing the impact of irregular or counter-trend price action.

**Moving Average Responsiveness**

Somewhat intuitively, the shorter the moving average the more responsive it will be to recent price action. For example, a 10 day moving average will be more significantly impacted by a sudden movement in the price of an asset in comparison to a 200 day moving average.

See this chart of NKE with a 10 exponential moving average (white line) and 200 exponential moving average (purple line) to understand this concept of moving average responsiveness: [https://imgur.com/gallery/snCrdjR](https://imgur.com/gallery/snCrdjR)

**EMA & SMA**

In addition to responsiveness to price action related to the period of moving average being utilized, there are also weighted calculations for certain types of moving averages.

Simple moving averages (sma's) are *unweighted* and are simply derived from the mean of the data points, such as the prior example of 200 day simple moving average being the average of the most recent 200 1 day candles.

Conversely, exponentially *weighted* moving averages (ema's) are calculated in a manner where the most recent price action is given more weight than the older data contained within the average.  As a result, ema's are more responsive to recent changes in price in comparison to their sma counterparts.

For example, see this 1 day candle chart of NKE with the 200 ema (solid purple line) and 200 sma (crossed purple line) on it: [https://imgur.com/gallery/DEL7C8u](https://imgur.com/gallery/DEL7C8u)

Personally, I use a combo of ema's and sma's in my technical analysis because I find that the interaction of particular ema's and sma's can be quite useful.

**Support/Resistance Levels**

Moving averages are a great tool to use for identifying potential support/resistance areas and also to use for risk management. I will frequently pay particular attention to a moving average that also coincides with a horizontal support/resistance level.

For example, see this 1 day NKE chart where the price retraced and was bought up off the 100 ema and liquidity zone combo (see horizontal support/resistance post for more info on liquidity zones): [https://imgur.com/gallery/URThRg1](https://imgur.com/gallery/URThRg1)

**MACRO TREND ANALYSIS**

A simple rule of thumb is an asset is generally bullish if it is OVER its 1 month 21 ema and generally bearish if it UNDER its 1 month 21 ema.

See this 1 month chart of the S&P 500: [https://imgur.com/gallery/0xVVbag](https://imgur.com/gallery/0xVVbag)

**EMA/SMA Crosses**

The crossing of particular ema's and sma's are taken as significant shifts in trend and will often trigger significant reactions by algorithms and savvy technical traders. The rationale for this significance is that it gives a clear read on changes in trend. Frequently, price action will ""wick"" into the cross to test that the cross is being respected by the broader market. For a bullish cross you want to see price getting aggressively bought up off the moving average cross, and for a bearish cross you want price action to be rejected to the downside off the crossed moving averages. In addition, once theses moving averages crosses do occur, the pace at which the moving averages continue to diverge from each other, or squeeze back together, can provide clues on whether this new trend is strengthening.

Below are some of the most important and basic ema/sma crosses with examples and explanations:

**LIGHT BULL/BEAR CROSSES**

21 ema crossing UNDER 55 ema (light bullish): [https://imgur.com/gallery/dQbSBdW](https://imgur.com/gallery/dQbSBdW)

**EARLY WARNING SIGN CROSSES**

10 sma crossing UNDER 21 ema and 30 sma crossing OVER 21 ema (bearish - early warning sign): [https://imgur.com/gallery/Lm7OYyJ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Lm7OYyJ)

10 sma crossing OVER and 30 sma crossing UNDER 21 ema (bullish - early warning sign): [https://imgur.com/gallery/EimNDB9](https://imgur.com/gallery/EimNDB9)

**MAJOR CROSSES - DEATH CROSS/GOLDEN CROSS**

Death Crosses and Golden Crosses are often considered ""major events"" on an asset by technical analysts. Similar to analyzing candle structure, the higher the time frame the crosses occur on (1d candles, 3d candles, 1 w candles) the more significant those crosses will be for establishing trend. A golden cross or death cross on a 3d or 1w time frame can set the trend for an equity for a period of months and sometimes years.

55 ema crossing UNDER 200 ema (""Death Cross"" - strong bearish): [https://imgur.com/gallery/WYDtmPq](https://imgur.com/gallery/WYDtmPq)

55 ema crossing OVER 200 ema (""Golden Cross"" - strong bullish): [https://imgur.com/gallery/TSglHe8](https://imgur.com/gallery/TSglHe8)

**Potential EMA's and SMA's to run:**

Below are some of my preferred moving averages. You will notice that I sometimes slightly alter certain moving averages to suit current market conditions.

**EMA's**

1. 9/10 ema
2. 20/21 ema
3. 50/55 ema
4. 89/100 ema
5. 200 ema
6. 377 ema

**SMA's**

1. 10 sma
2. 30 sma
3. 50 sma
4. 100/128 sma
5. 200 sma

So that covers my introduction to moving averages and some of the intricacies that should be considered when using them for technical analysis.

I’d love to hear about your experiences with this.

I’ve been trading for a while now, but I keep noticing the same pattern: as long as I’m working my regular job, I can’t stay consistently profitable. Work and daily life take my focus, I lose discipline, and eventually my gains get eaten up again.

But when I’m on vacation, it’s the complete opposite – I’m focused, structured, and suddenly profitable. It makes me wonder if this is really sustainable as a side hustle.

So I’m curious:
	•	How was it for you when you first started trading?
	•	Have you managed to stay consistently profitable while keeping a job?
	•	Or did you eventually reach the point where you decided: “all in or nothing,” quit your job, and go full-time?
	•	Did you go through failures and restarts along the way?

1mm8mx6,2025-08-09,2025-08-09 23:50:10,Sharing my personal story as an unintentional 9:30 - 4:00 trader,"**Edit:** I've gotta laugh. For some humans, they've totally lost the ability to discern between AI and human. And there is nothing I can do over the internet to prove otherwise. Never thought I'd be the one having to subject myself to the Turing Test. Hilarious, if you ask me.

I browse Reddit to fill the lonely void that comes with being a trader. Part of the impetus for posting this is because of AI fatigue. It feels like every other post on Reddit is AI drivel, so this post is my small way of protesting.

Origin story: I lost my uncle, best friend from high school (fuck cancer), and another close friend from college (seriously, fuck cancer) all in 2 months. I also lost my job during this period as deep depression set in. This marks the beginning of how I became an unintentional trader.

As I said, I'm an unintentional trader as trading wasn't anywhere on my radar. But I had to put food on the table, and how hard could it be? Sometimes, not knowing what you're getting yourself into is a superpower. So I dove in head first.

The first month, I made $40K.  I thought I had figured something out (as did my wife). Then I lost $15K in a day. Then $8K the next. I felt the blood draining from my face and I stared at the screen for a good while trying to process it all.

Not so much because I lost money (yeah, this part sucked), but because if I couldn't figure out how to extract money from the market, then I'd have to find a job and the job market felt hopeless and has been frozen solid in my industry.

Every day for a year was like drinking out of a firehose. No exaggeration, I put in a minimum 12 hour days, including weekends trying to get better. I wouldn't have imagined the words like kurtosis, leptokurtic, skewness, etc becoming part of my vernacular, and I started interpreting everything through the lens of trading. I also meditate, so it often becomes philosophical as I like drawing analogies between the two:  e.g., everything in life is a trade, if you're not struggling then you're not improving, etc (identical to meditation).

After about half a year, the mind fog gradually started lifting. I understood the lingo, and what was once hard to understand became easy and second nature. But I still wasn't making money, and I realized that my initial performance was pure luck (flip a coin 10 times and you can get heads 10x in a row).

I backtested to ad nauseam. But I still lost money. I remember waking up in the middle of the night in panic, because I kept losing money and I couldn't stop worrying about my wife and 2 young kids. Every time I'd look at my kids, even in photos, I felt that I was failing as a father not being able to financially support them. It hurts to think about it even now.

I spent the next 3 months iterating daily, improving some aspect, no matter how small. Key thing for my strategy was reducing execution risk, so I iterated on that until I could get my backtests to match my actual trades as closely as possible.

Behavioral risk lurked in the background, because I didn't know if I could stick to my rules (that I came up with after countless backtests). But backtests being historical and not indicative of future performance, I often thought I knew better and deviated from the plan. Even when I made money, it felt kind of icky. And when I lost money, it felt worse. And because I interfered, it messed up the statistics.

On the 4th month, I made $1500. I am prouder of this $1500 than the initial $40000 I made, because I followed all my rules. Because I knew it's repeatable, and I knew that if this edge erodes, I am capable of putting in the work to figure out another way to extract money from the market.

In theory couldn’t you feed every bit of chart data for a stock, future, or whatever into an AI and let it figure out the most effective way to trade based on mountains of historical data and its ability to live web browse news, twitter, blogs, and account for the human factor?

That’s basically what day traders are doing anyway. Just follow some kind of pattern or setup and try to factor in news and sentiment to guess what’s coming next.

But how could humans possibly do that better than AI? Especially when AI is insanely good at analyzing massive amounts of data and making predictions.

Chart data seems like the exact kind of thing AI should be amazing at. It’s clean, it doesn’t need much memory, and it’s just candle patterns. Open, close, high, low.

1ny7n6l,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 18:34:11,The Hooligan Playbook Chapter 3.5,"The Ledger is not an X-Y graph. It is not a cartoon grid. It is a table. One column holds the
Edge Index. One column holds Conviction. The row where they meet gives the Operator a
command.

The Edge Index is the score. Conviction is the side. When the Index is positive, Conviction
leans buy side. When the Index is negative, Conviction leans sell side. When the Index hugs
zero, you are in the shadows.

The Edge Index can be built from price action, but it is not chained to it. The Operator has
freedom to pull in whatever signals they can measure with consistency.

Structure, momentum, and liquidity sweeps might be the foundation. Volatility regimes,
sector rotations, and relative strength between markets can add weight.

If you have access to flow data, open interest, or positioning, those can be factored as well.
The Index is not about using one indicator. It is about reducing chaos to a single number that
is scored the same way every time.

Conviction comes from direction. Sometimes it mirrors the Index. Sometimes it is tested
against a higher timeframe. A trader might have a session-level Index of +3, but if the weekly tape is rejecting new highs, Conviction is marked down. The Ledger captures that friction.

The Operator sees the tension, and the table tells them to size down or wait.

Think of the Ledger as a war table. Across the top are Conviction states: strong buy, weak
buy, neutral, weak sell, strong sell. 

Down the side are Index bands: +4 to +5, +2 to +3, –2 to -3, –4 to –5. Where they cross, the table holds a command. Trade full size. Trade partial. Hedge. Do nothing.

Examples make it real.

Spot Trading: The Index reads +4. Conviction is bullish. The Ledger allows long spot with up
to one percent of risk capital. The Operator buys on pullback into broken resistance. If the
Index fades to +2, risk is cut in half. If it collapses to zero, the table says flatten.

Options: The Index reads +3. Conviction is bullish. The Ledger authorizes call debit spreads with moderate size. If the Index pushes to +4, the Operator can roll the short leg higher or scale in. If the Index fades to +1, the Ledger commands exit.

Mixed Read: The Index reads +2, but Conviction is bearish due to higher-timeframe
rejection. The Ledger commands a half-sized short. In spot, that might be a small starter
position. In options, a bear call spread with tight risk. If the higher timeframe falls back in line with the Index, Conviction shifts and the table allows more size.

The Ledger is built to kill emotion. It does not ask how you feel about Powell, or what Twitter
is screaming. It does not ask whether you are scared or greedy. It only cares about your
numbers and your direction. If they align, you act. If they conflict, you size down or wait. If
they vanish, you disappear.

The Ledger is not about being right. It is about being consistent. If you obey it, you survive. If
you betray it, you bleed.

Here’s what a Ledger might look like on paper. This is not the Ledger you will build. This is
only an example to show how the table works.

+4 to +5 Bullish: Press long, full size
+2 to +3 Bullish: Trade long, half size
0 to +1 Neutral: Probe small or wait
–2 to –3 Bearish: Trade short, half size
–4 to –5 Bearish: Press short, full size

Worked Example (Spot)
The Index prints +3. Conviction is bullish. The Ledger says: half-sized long. The Operator
buys spot ETH on a pullback, risks 0.5% of capital, and plans to scale if Index lifts to +4. If
the Index fades to +1, the Ledger says cut. No emotion. Only the table

Why This Is Only an Example.

If every Operator ran the same Ledger, the machine would sniff it out and hunt it. The market feeds on predictable order flow. Your survival depends on your Ledger being yours. The structure above shows how a table gives commands, but the inputs, the weighting, and the calibration must be your own. That’s the firewall. That’s what keeps you hidden in the
shadows.",1,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ny7n6l/the_hooligan_playbook_chapter_35/,new,Discussion,1.0

Here's my weekend routine:

**Saturday: Review the week**

* Go through every trade I took - wins AND losses
* What did I miss? What economic events actually moved my pairs?
* Journal the emotions around each trade (this is harder than it sounds)

**Sunday: Look ahead**

* Check the economic calendar for the week - which releases actually matter for my pairs?
* Read up on what's happening macro economically in the currencies I trade (central bank speeches, geopolitical developments, GDP reports coming up)
* Review my open positions with fresh eyes - do they still make sense given what's coming this week?
* Make forecasts on my main pairs based on fundamentals, not just technicals

**The key shift:** I used to only look at charts and indicators. Now I spend more time understanding WHY currencies might move, not just predicting THAT they'll move.

It's not as fun as watching price action. But understanding the economic drivers behind currency movements has cut my losing weeks significantly.

I’m a trader (mostly discretionary, some algo) exploring if there is demand for a stat based terminal focused purely on **patterns, events, and price action** (less on fundamentals).

All analysis would be statistically grounded with minimal AI usage (certainly not for the math/backtesting part)

You’d be able to enter natural-language queries like:

1. What happened the last time QQQ went down 3 days in a row?
2. What happened when AAPL closed up 3% three days straight?
3. META is down 7 days in a row, QQQ is up — analyze what happened next (1 week, 1 month).
4. Show me how NVDA performs after earnings gaps of ≥ 3%.
5. List the tickers that rebound most after 5 red days in a row.
6. What’s the average SPY return the week after CPI beats expectations?
7. For the last month has OPEN rallied more in the morning session, overnight session, or PM session?

After entering a query you would get a full backtest, 5+ years with average trade, sharpe, profit factor, charts, etc.

**Looking for honest feedback:**

1. Is this something you’d actually pay for?
2. What kinds of queries or stats would be most valuable to you? (1-7, or others)

I recently invested in a new GPU, an RTX 5070 Ti,  with the goal of using it to train AI models.

I’m a full-stack software developer with over 12 years of experience, so I’m comfortable with Python and machine learning fundamentals.

I decided to work with a Transformer-based model and I’m using tools like Weights & Biases (W&B) and Optuna for tracking and optimization. However, I’ve hit a bottleneck with the features I’m using to train the model.

I’ve experimented with multiple feature sets and even explored feature engineering with ChatGPT, but I’m currently stuck at a 56-57% success rate, which isn’t good enough for what I’m aiming for.

I’ve tried 5-minute, 15-minute, and 30-minute timeframes, but none have made a noticeable difference. I’ve also tested common indicators such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands, among others.

I’d really appreciate any advice or insights on the following:

Is a Transformer model a good choice for this type of problem?

What would be an optimal target definition (for example, 2× ATR profit)?

Which features or indicators tend to be the most valuable?

Which timeframe is most effective for training in this context?

Any tips and tricks?

you are bleeding out. The market does not forgive the trader who shows up without a
framework. You can win for a while on luck, you can run hot for a few trades, but the machine
will always catch you.

Most traders lose because they do not have rules. They trade on impulse, they chase the last candle, they flip bias three times before lunch. The market feeds on that chaos. The brokers encourage it because every click pays them. The gurus cheer it on because every loss keeps you buying their signals. Without the Ledger you are food.

The Ledger is survival because it strips away the noise. It gives you clarity when everyone
else is spinning. When the Index says strong and Conviction is aligned, the Ledger says
attack. When the Index is tangled, the Ledger says stand down. You do not waste bullets,
you do not get trapped in the churn. You live to fight another day.

Compounding only works if you are still in the game. That is the part nobody wants to hear.
Everybody talks about doubling accounts and chasing ten baggers, but you cannot compound if you are dead. The Ledger is what keeps you alive long enough for math to take
over. It does not need you to be perfect. It only needs you to stay disciplined.

The Ledger also matters because it kills emotion. Traders blow up when they confuse
conviction with hope. They stay in losers, they press against strength, they fight the tape.
The Ledger cuts that out. It says what to do and you either do it or you don’t. If you betray it, you know why you lost. If you follow it, you build discipline with every trade.

The market is designed to harvest retail. The circus keeps them entertained, the trap keeps
them active, the numbers prove they lose, and the blood machine drains them dry. The

And that will be comparable to 2020 top.  What happened afterwards, Silver experienced a correction which lasted 2 years.

Each one has the same information. Each one runs the Ledger in their own way.

Operator One wakes up and runs the Edge Index. The score is strong, momentum is aligned, volatility is steady. Conviction points bullish. The Ledger gives the command: press long.

Operator One sizes in, not recklessly but with purpose. When price pulls back, they scale.
When the move extends, they hold. The day ends green, not because of luck but because
the Ledger told them to act with size when the stars lined up.

Operator Two runs the same Index. The score is tangled, momentum sideways, volatility
unstable. Conviction is flat. The Ledger gives a different command: do nothing. Operator
Two obeys. They do not trade. They watch retail flail in and out of bad positions. They end
the day flat. No profit, but no wounds. They are alive, and survival is profit in itself.

Operator Three looks at the same numbers. The Index says one thing, their Conviction says
another. They feel bearish even though the Index shows bullish strength. They ignore the
Ledger. They short. The market rips the other way. They double down, hoping it turns. By the
close, they are bled out. They did not lose to the market. They lost to themselves. They lost
because they betrayed the Ledger.

This is the split. Operators who respect the Ledger follow its commands. They are not always rewarded, but they are never destroyed. 

Operators who betray it get harvested. They either die fast, blowing up when they press against strength, or they die slow, bled out by a
thousand cuts.

1nxr5wd,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 07:10:28,The Hooligan Playbook Chapter 3.2,"The Ledger is not theory. It is not a slogan. It is the table where every input meets its
consequence. You take your Edge Index and you take your Conviction, and you cross them.
The outcome is not a feeling. It is an instruction.

The Edge Index is the score. It tells you how strong the market is trending, how momentum
is building, how volatility is shifting. The Conviction is the direction. It is the side of the trade you are prepared to press. Alone, each one is incomplete. Together, inside the Ledger, they turn into a playbook.

Imagine it as a grid. On one side runs your Index, from weak to strong. On the other runs
your Conviction, from bearish to bullish. Where they intersect, the Ledger gives you a
command. A strong Index with high bullish Conviction means you press long. A fading Index with bearish Conviction means you position short. A tangled Index with no clear read means you do not trade.

This is where most retail falls apart. They score the market one way, then trade in the
opposite direction because of news or a headline. They feel bearish while their own chart screams bullish. They override themselves and hand their money to the machine. The Ledger prevents that betrayal. It locks you into the truth of your own system.

The Ledger also defines size. When the Index is at full strength and Conviction is aligned,
the Ledger authorizes you to press harder. When strength fades, it cuts your risk. No
emotion, no guess. Your allocation comes from the book, not from fear or greed.

There is no mystery here. It is just structure. But that structure is what keeps you from turning into another casualty. Without it you are gambling in the dark. With it you are running plays that are bigger than any one trade.

The Ledger is not a journal you write in once a week. It is alive. It is your daily script. You
wake up, you score the Index, you note your Conviction, and the Ledger tells you where you
stand. In the fight. On the bench. Or waiting in the shadows for the next opening.

This is how you stop trading vibes and start trading rules. The Ledger is not optional. It is
survival.

1nxqxah,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 06:57:31,The Hooligan Playbook Chapter 3.1,"The Ledger is the Operator’s book of war. It is not Wall Street’s profit and loss statement. It is
not your broker’s balance sheet. The Ledger is the framework where survival gets written in
blood and profit.

Every Operator who lasts has one, whether they admit it or not. The suits hide theirs inside
risk departments and quant code. In the underground, you strip it down to what matters. The Ledger takes your Edge Index, the cold numbers of trend, momentum, and volatility. Then it fuses that with your Conviction, your bias, your direction of attack. 

The result is a record that dictates action.

The Ledger is not about predicting the future. You do not need the future. You need rules.
Rules that tell you when to strike. Rules that tell you when to scale. Rules that tell you when
to hedge and when to sit on your hands. You feed your Index and your Conviction into the
Ledger and it spits out the play. No guesswork. No guru hype. No gambler’s hunch.

Most traders never keep a Ledger. They chase alerts. They ride whatever the feed tells
them. They jump from one hot take to another and wonder why they bleed out. The Ledger
filters the chaos. It keeps you disciplined while everyone else is chasing noise. It is the line
between gambling and operating.

This is not glamour. Nobody claps when you follow your Ledger. Nobody celebrates
discipline. But the Ledger keeps you alive long enough for your edge to pay out. It is your
scoreboard. It is your battlefield map. It is your execution manual.

1nxq8lw,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 06:16:33,The Hooligan Playbook Chapter 2.4,"Conviction and Bias

The Edge Index gives you a number. Conviction gives that number teeth.

Conviction is not a hunch. Conviction is a weighted stance, born out of structure. Bullish
conviction, bearish conviction, or neutral. The Edge Index tells you if the market has
conditions worth trading. Conviction tells you which side of the street you want to be on.
Most traders confuse conviction with ego. They feel bullish, so they load up calls. They feel
bearish, so they smash puts. That is not conviction. That is gambling in costume. 

Conviction without framework is suicide. Framework without conviction is paralysis. You need both.

Conviction controls bias. Bias controls sizing. If your Index is strong and your conviction
aligns, you press. If your Index is weak but conviction is clear, you probe small. If conviction is foggy, you pull size down to nothing.

Think of it as a hierarchy. The Edge Index measures conditions. Conviction defines the bias. Bias drives action and sizing.
A strong Edge Index plus strong conviction equals large exposure. A weak Index plus strong conviction equals a test shot. A weak Index plus no conviction means you sit on your hands.

This is how you move from surviving to compounding. The Gambler bets big with no
framework. The Drifter hesitates with no bias. The Operator measures the Index, defines the
conviction, and then executes according to the bias.

Conviction is not about being right on every trade. Conviction is about being aligned with the structure. If the Index shows bullish strength and the conviction is bullish, then every dollar you risk is aligned with probability. If the Index is neutral, forcing conviction is suicide.

The blood machine feasts on traders who cannot define their bias. They flip long, then short, then flat, chasing every move. Every flip costs spread, slippage, and mental energy. The
Operator does not chase. The Operator defines bias. Then the Operator acts.

Conviction is the engine. Bias is the direction. The Index is the map. Together they turn
survival into strategy.

Conviction is not theory. It shows up in the account balance.

Take two Operators, both trading with an Edge Index score of +3. Conditions are strong.
Both see the same breakout. Both have the same tools. The only difference is how they act
on conviction. Operator A trusts the Index and aligns his conviction with it. He sizes into the trade with 1 percent of capital. His bias is clear, bullish. When the move extends, he scales once more.

The trade returns 3R. His 1 percent risk turns into a 3 percent gain. One trade pushes his
month into profit.

Operator B hesitates. The Index says strong, but his conviction is cloudy. He has been
burned before. He sizes tiny, risking 0.25 percent. He exits too early, scalping crumbs. 

The same move that gave Operator A 3 percent leaves Operator B with 0.3 percent. Safe, but
insignificant.

Now flip the coin. The next setup fails. Operator A takes a full 1 percent loss. Operator B loses only 0.25 percent. Both are still in the game. But the difference is in compounding. 

One conviction-driven win erases several losses. Hesitant wins never stack.
Conviction is not about always being right. Conviction is about pressing when the structure says press, and protecting when the structure says protect. It is how you escape mediocrity.

Barber and Odean’s research proved that overconfidence destroys traders. But lack of
conviction is just as deadly in a quieter way. Without conviction, every win is a fraction of
what it could be. Without conviction, the account flatlines.

The Gambler explodes because his conviction is blind. The Drifter starves because his
conviction is absent. The Operator compounds because his conviction is aligned with the
Index.

The blood machine does not care which path you choose. It bleeds the Gambler fast. It
bleeds the Drifter slow. Conviction is the only way out.

1nxpdmt,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 05:22:13,Why most beginners fail in the stock market and how I trained myself to avoid it,"I still remember the night I bought my first single share of Apple. It felt like holding a golden ticket. At the same time, I was terrified because I had no idea what I was actually doing. That’s when I promised myself I wouldn’t just gamble. I’d learn the basics the right way. And I’d read the right books to equip myself in the stock market.

The first thing I realized is that a stock isn’t just a lottery ticket, it’s actual ownership of a company. That shift in perspective hit me when I read Burton Malkiel’s A Random Walk Down Wall Street. He explains that when you buy one share of Coca-Cola, you literally own a slice of the business. It’s not abstract anymore. From there, I learned the two ways you earn: price growth and dividends. I know it sounds simple, but when I looked at my first dividend check (tiny as it was), I felt the connection between patience, ownership, and reward.   

But the biggest lesson wasn’t technical, it was psychological. Behavioral finance research from Barber and Odean showed how most traders actually lose money because they can’t control their impulses. I saw myself in their findings. I wanted to “do something” every hour. That’s when I picked up Mark Douglas’s Trading in the Zone, which drilled into me that trading is allprobabilities, not certainties. That one idea saved me from so many reckless trades.

My first week of notes looked like chaos. Terms like bull market, bear market, P/E ratio, stop-loss, they all felt overwhelming. But I noticed a strange pattern. Every night, when I read even just 20 minutes on stock trading, the fog started to clear. Reading is like weightlifting for your brain, it doesn’t feel like much at the moment, but over months you get sharper. I swear my decision making at work improved too.

Some resources truly carried me. Ross Cameron’s YouTube channel made trading feel less intimidated. His story of starting with $583 and pushing it into millions made me believe consistency beats luck. Then there was the podcast Masters in Business by Barry Ritholtz, where guests like Terrance Odean explained why we sabotage our own trades. These weren’t motivational fluff, they were direct mirrors to my own mistakes.

A friend then introduced me to a new AI-powered app called BeFreed, built by a Columbia University team. It felt like the learning companion I always wished existed. I barely have time to finish thick finance books during the week, but this app takes books, research, expert talks, and even podcasts and turns them into personalized audio lessons. You can pick if you want a 10-minute summary or a 40-minute deep dive. I even chose a “professor” host voice as my stock mentor, which weirdly makes me look forward to listening. What I love the most is how it adapts, the more I listen, the more it learns my style and builds me a personal study roadmap. I’ve already finished more material in two weeks than I did in months of “someday reading.” It’s helping me build a daily reading habit I thought I’d lost.

Other gems I leaned on: Jack Schwager’s Market Wizards (this book will make you question everything you think you know about trading. Insanely good read), and Nick McCullum’s YouTube course on Python for quantitative trading (I finally understood what algorithmic trading means). Each one stretched my brain in a different way, but all reinforced the same truth: daily learning compounds just like money.

I started this journey because I wanted to make smart investments. What I didn’t expect was how much the act of daily reading itself would reshape me. The more I read, the calmer my mind feels, the less I chase noise, and the more I trust the slow compounding of both knowledge and wealth. Knowledge is leverage. It’s the one thing that pays you interest for life.

1nxox6e,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 04:53:14,The Hooligan Playbook Chapter 2.3,"The Edge Index is how you measure where you stand.

Most traders mistake a signal for an edge. They see a pattern. They see a moving average
crossover. They convince themselves that is the edge. It is not. A single signal is not an
edge. You only have edge when you measure it inside a framework.

The Edge Index does that job. It tells you when the market is giving you conditions to press
and when the market is telling you to protect. It keeps you out of low quality battles. It keeps
you from guessing.

Institutions run systems like this all day. They track momentum. They track trend alignment.
They track breadth. They track order flow. They roll the inputs into a score so emotion does
not get a vote. Strong score means increase exposure. Weak score means reduce exposure.
Simple. Repeatable. Real.

Your job is not to copy someone else’s math. Your job is to build your own Edge Index. The
framework scales with the operator. Some keep it lean. Some add layers. Some build a full
spectrum model that watches everything. The principle never changes. Turn chaos into a
number. Then obey the number.

Example One: 3 inputs for a simple operator: Trend alignment, Momentum, Market breadth.
Max score plus 3. Min score minus 3. Fast and clean.

Example Two: 5 inputs for an intermediate operator: Trend alignment, Momentum, Market
breadth, Correlation check, Liquidity check. Max score plus 5. Min score minus 5. More
nuance, better for swing trades.

Example Three: 10 inputs for an advanced operator: Trend alignment across multiple time
frames, Momentum blend, Market breadth, Correlation check, Liquidity check, Earnings
trend, Interest rates, Sector relative strength, News flow alignment, Volatility regime. Max
score plus 10. Min score minus 10. Full spectrum. More work. Less noise.

These are examples. Your Edge Index does not have to be 3 or 5 or 10 inputs. It can be
whatever fits your style and your process. What matters is consistency and objectivity.

Here is the rule. Use at least 3 independent metrics to support what you believe the trend is doing. One metric can trick you. Two metrics can argue with each other. Three or more force
confirmation. They keep you honest.

""Let your system run. Do not let emotion override it."" — J. Welles Wilder Jr.

You are drifting. Or you are operating.

The Gambler is loud. He thinks size equals edge. He nails a few early wins. He might even
post a hot month. Without a framework, aggression becomes suicide. One cold streak and he is gone. The more he presses the worse he does. He is not compounding. He is sprinting into a wall while downvoting alpha on Reddit.

The Drifter dies slow. No conviction. No framework. Only feelings and headlines. He follows the news. He chases whatever is trending. He arrives late every time. He makes a little when the market is obvious. He bleeds it back in the chop. His equity curve looks like an EKG. He survives longer than the Gambler, but he never makes enough to matter. He is not free. He is chained to mediocrity.

The Operator runs the Framework. He measures edge with the index. He scales size only when conviction is real. He knows how each trade fits into the matrix. He is not the fastest. He is not the flashiest. He is the one who compounds.

Give each trader 20,000 dollars. After 12 months the Gambler enjoys a couple of epic wins. One blowout sends him to zero. 

The Drifter finishes with 17,000 dollars. He is still alive but he paid tuition to the market. 

The Operator finishes with 26,000 dollars. No Lambo. No mansion. Real profit. He survives. He compounds. He grows.

1nxo43c,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 04:01:24,Advice for the younger generation !!,"People always ask me, ‘Yo, how’d you become so rich?’ or ‘What’s one piece of advice you’d give the younger generation?’

My answer’s always simple: work harder.
Yeah, I know it sounds basic — but that’s exactly why most people overlook it. Success ain’t complicated, it’s just uncomfortable. You’ve gotta outwork everyone.

When you find something you believe in — get obsessed.
If you’re trading, live and breathe it. Study the charts like your life depends on it. Journal every single trade. Analyze every move.

And listen up — stop hopping between strategies.
That’s where most beginners fail. They chase shortcuts, copy others, and wonder why they’re stuck. That’s not how you win.
Build your own strategy. Use the fundamentals, use basic SMC concepts, and refine it until it’s yours. That’s how you stand out.

Most people treat trading like a side hustle. That’s why they stay average.
If you actually want to quit your 9-5 and live free — you’ve gotta treat this like a profession. Like a mission. Like your only way out.

Trading is just a skill — and once you master it, you’re set for life.
But mastery doesn’t come from talent. It comes from obsession, discipline, and hours alone when nobody’s watching.

So stop talking. Stop making excuses.
Work harder. Study longer. Get obsessed.
That’s how you change your life.

I’m out — hope this hits the younger generation.

In the early days, my “strategy” was mostly watching influencers on YouTube or skimming quick tips on Twitter, thinking I could piece it together. I’d burn hours staring at charts, jumping between indicators, following news cycles, and second-guessing every move. The wins felt random, and the losses were discouraging. I was in a constant loop of doubt. None of what I was doing felt sustainable, and after a few all-nighters and poorly-timed trades, I hit serious burnout. It wasn’t just about losing money; it was the confusion and anxiety of not truly understanding what I was doing or why.  
  
What pushed me to keep going wasn’t the hope of some “big win,” but the need for a real process, a way to learn in the open, admit when I was lost, and actually connect with others who’d been through the same. I started to notice that there’s a huge difference between chasing signals and genuinely building a toolbox you trust. Too much of trading content out there feels like highlights without the hard parts, and that lack of transparency can make the confusion and burnout worse.

1nxmcfl,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 02:12:23,I Journaled Every Single Trade for 1 Year… Here’s What I Found,"After a full year of journaling every single trade, here’s what the data showed me:



https://preview.redd.it/9lvk9lp4e1tf1.png?width=1755&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a35a21423b7a80176d8d5f079a30bb674679c61

Win rate: 39%



Average R: 2.42R



Net P/L: $30,847



Largest win: $3,050



Largest loss: -$1,137



The equity curve wasn’t perfect, but the growth was steady and “linear-ish.” It wasn’t luck, it was data + discipline.



Here are 5 things journaling taught me:



1. You don’t need a high win rate, risk/reward does the heavy lifting.

For most of the year my win rate sat below 40%. If I judged my trading on win % alone, I would’ve quit months ago. But journaling proved the math: with a 2.42R average, my winners more than covered my losers. It only takes a handful of clean setups executed with size to make a month profitable, even if most trades are small scratches or losers. Now also introducing a new ORB setup too which is around 45% winrate and 2R fixed so it should be interesting



2. Losing streaks are predictable and survivable if you know your edge.

When you track every trade, you can see exactly how long your average red streak lasts. For me, the data showed clusters of 4-6 losing trades in a row were normal. Once I understood that, I stopped spiraling emotionally after 3 losses and could calmly stick to the plan. Journaling turns drawdowns from something emotional into something measurable.



3. Certain times of year/sessions perform better, market cycles matter.

Over hundreds of trades, it became clear that not all market environments are equal. Summer chop dragged down my expectancy, while fall/winter trends lifted it back up. Even within the day, certain hours consistently underperformed. Knowing this helps me conserve energy and avoid forcing trades in low-probability cycles.



4. Tracking expectancy gives confidence when P/L fluctuates.

My expectancy averaged $77.9 per trade. That number became a compass. On days or even weeks where I was red, I could zoom out and know that if I just executed another 100 trades with discipline, the expectancy would play out. Without journaling, it’s too easy to let short-term noise make you abandon a strategy that’s statistically sound. Changed through bearish and bullish cycles also can be supoer scray.



5. The numbers don’t lie. Emotions do.

Before journaling, I always “felt” like I was better or worse than I actually was. Reviewing the data crushed those illusions. Trades I thought were my best setups actually had negative expectancy. Patterns I ignored ended up being my most profitable. The journal doesn’t care about feelings, it’s a mirror of your edge in cold, hard numbers.



https://preview.redd.it/v2cato5be1tf1.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=93856892f2e8709af54259384d6783eb55d1b72b

Journaling exposes your blind spots. I know which trades to size into, which to cut, and how long I can expect drawdowns to last. That’s how you survive this game long enough to let compounding do its work.



So my question to you is, do you know your results this clearly? Do you know what to expect in your market cycles?

excitement, or your fear. Feelings are what the blood machine feeds on. That is how the
Street pulls money out of retail pockets every single day.

The only thing that cuts through that noise is a framework.

A framework is not a hot tip. It is not a guru’s signal service. It is not a gut feeling. A
framework is structure. A framework is armor. It is how you survive long enough to let your
edge play out.

Think about a casino. The house edge can be 2 percent or 3 percent. That looks tiny. But
over thousands of spins and hands, that small edge becomes a guaranteed profit. Players
walk in with feelings. Excitement. Greed. Tilt. The house sits back with math. You already
know who wins.

Trading is no different. Real money runs on frameworks. Funds measure conviction. Funds
measure risk. Funds execute according to systems. Any single trade can lose. Across
hundreds of trades, a real edge with a real framework keeps them alive and profitable.
Retail loses because retail has no framework. The Gambler thinks aggression will save him.
The Drifter thinks following the crowd will save him. Both are food for the machine.

The Operator is different. The Operator runs the Framework. He measures edge with the
index. He sizes according to conviction. He balances his trades with the matrix. He does not care about the outcome of one trade because survival is not built on one trade. 

Survival is built on hundreds.

They prove what the circus hides and what the trap denies: retail loses, over and over again. In the United States, Barber and Odean (2000) analyzed 66,465 brokerage accounts over a six-year span. They found that the average individual investor underperformed the market by 6.5 percent per year.

The most active traders, the ones convinced they were in control, performed the worst. The more they traded, the more they bled. Across the ocean, Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean (2009) studied day traders in Taiwan. This was no small sample, it included every trade placed by every investor in the market. The results were brutal. The average day trader lost 3.8 percent annually, and only one percent of traders consistently beat the market after costs. The other 99 percent were food for the machine.

In Brazil, the securities regulator CVM tracked 20,000 day traders from 2013 to 2015. After one year, 97 percent had lost money. After two years, nearly 100 percent were gone. The conclusion was unavoidable: day trading for the majority was not a path to survival, it was a conveyor belt into bankruptcy.

The Bank for International Settlements (2019) found the same pattern in forex markets. Over 80 percent of retail accounts lost money within a year. In Europe, regulators now require brokers to publish the percentage of clients who lose. The average disclosure reads the same: 70 to 80 percent lose money.

These numbers span markets, countries, and decades. They are not anomalies. They are the rule. The circus keeps the lights on by selling dreams. The trap keeps traders busy by feeding them leverage and dopamine. But the numbers do not care about illusions. They show what survival really looks like.

And the truth is this: without a framework, you die. Without a system, you bleed. Without discipline, you feed the blood machine.

That if you trade longer, harder, with more screens and more alerts, you will beat the Street. The trap flatters your ego, telling you that you are special, that you can
outwork algorithms and institutions armed with billions.

But the trap is not built on work. It is built on design. Platforms are engineered like casinos.
Every scroll, every push notification, every glowing green candle is meant to trigger
dopamine. MIT researchers studying online brokerage accounts found that traders placed
more orders after receiving positive feedback from past gains, even if those gains were
random. This is not skill. This is conditioning. The trap keeps you clicking, because clicks are
blood flow.

Leverage is the trap’s favorite weapon. Retail is handed twenty-to-one, fifty-to-one, or in
options, nearly infinite leverage. The lure of outsized gains blinds traders to the certainty of
outsized losses. The Bank for International Settlements (2019) showed that more than 80
percent of retail forex traders lost money within a year, largely due to leverage misuse. The
trap gives you chips, but the table is tilted.
The trap convinces you that education is enough. Gurus tell you if you just memorize
patterns, you will win. Yet academic research proves otherwise. Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean

Knowledge without framework is not an edge. It is just another illusion in the tent.

The trap feeds on overtrading. In a study of 66,000 U.S. households with brokerage
accounts, Barber and Odean (2000) found that the most active traders underperformed the
market by more than 6 percent annually. The trap wants you busy. The busier you are, the
more it eats.

The truth is brutal. The Street does not want you profitable. It wants you active. The trap wins when you trade because you feel like you must, not because your framework says the
conditions are right.

Survival requires breaking the trap. That means fewer trades, not more. Patience, not action.
Waiting until the framework says the conditions align. The Operator knows the trap is
everywhere , in dopamine, in leverage, in overconfidence, and the Operator steps
around it.

package hope as if it were strategy. The crowd gathers, the retail traders pile in, and the
show begins. But retail is not in the seats. Retail is on the stage. They are the clowns, the
animals, the ones being bled to keep the performance running.

The circus thrives on illusion. It convinces traders that excitement equals opportunity. That
the louder the commentary, the sharper the edge. CNBC yells. YouTube streams pump.
Twitter floods with hot takes and chart screenshots. Noise drowns out silence, and silence is
where the edge would actually live. Retail is addicted to the spectacle. Without the show, the

The gurus play their parts well. They flash cars, rented houses, and screenshots of
cherry-picked wins. A 2022 survey by MagnifyMoney found that 58 percent of young
investors said they got trading advice from social media, not from institutions or financial
professionals. The circus works because the crowd trusts the ringmasters. And the
ringmasters keep them dancing long enough to bleed them out.

It is not just social media. Brokers dress up trading platforms with fireworks. When
Robinhood was dragged into congressional hearings after the GameStop saga, they
admitted that confetti and digital celebrations were built into the app to encourage more
trades. This was not education. It was performance. The circus needed volume. The circus
needed blood.

the tickets. Retail pays for entry every time they place a trade without a framework. They
walk into the circus thinking they are buying a skill. In reality, they are buying a ticket to be
devoured.

The circus never ends. When one guru burns out, another pops up. When one tent

1nxbyx1,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 17:37:41,Does combining stocks and crypto on one platform make sense?,"Most traders are used to managing multiple platforms stocks on one app, crypto on another, and maybe futures somewhere else. It works, but it adds friction. When markets move quickly, those extra steps can mean missed entries or slower exits.

Bitget has positioned itself as a universal exchange, where both traditional stocks and crypto can be traded in the same place. Instead of moving between different accounts, traders can switch from Tesla to Bitcoin, or rotate capital from ETH into stock futures, without leaving the platform.

For active traders, this setup could change how strategies are executed. It’s less about managing scattered accounts and more about reacting in real time to market conditions. That flexibility matters when volatility opens small windows of opportunity.

The bigger question is whether traders will embrace an all-in-one model like Bitget’s, or continue preferring specialized platforms for each market. At the end of the day, efficiency and execution speed often decide where capital flows.",1,0,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nxbyx1/does_combining_stocks_and_crypto_on_one_platform/,new,Discussion,1.0

See, if I could restart, I’d focus on one style instead of bouncing between scalping, swing trading, and whatever strategy I saw online. Ive noticed that's what a lot of you guys do, and thays what I did when i was new to trading too. 

That constant switching wasted years. See, I’d build a simple, rule-based system around one setup, journal every trade, and treat it like a business from day one. Journaling felt pointless when I started, it really did... but in reality it was the only thing that forced me to see patterns in my wins and losses. On top of that, I’d make risk management non-negotiable. Back then I thought max loss rules and position sizing were things for “later,” but they’re what would have kept me from blowing up accounts and losing confidence early. Surviving year one should be the real goal, not doubling your account. Just surviving.

The other big shift would be mindset. I wasted too much time idolizing gurus and searching for a magic indicator, when in reality every trader I know who’s still around relies on discipline, execution, and patience. The edge isn’t a secret tool... it’s following your plan even when it’s boring. I also would’ve treated my capital like a startup investment, not gambling money. That means clear expectations, realistic goals, and understanding that profitability takes years, not weeks. If I had approached day one with that perspective, I’d be far ahead of where I am today.

What's behind it? Just the luck? 

Imho behind this luck is an instinctive (do not confuse it with intuitive) trading.  
  
Instinctive player may know nothing of the trading theory, but he has an innate sense of where the market goes, how to run with the crowd, and not against it.  This kind of player can take huge risk ( without realizing it), and stick successfully to the positions which would long before be abandoned by any seasoned trader.  
  
But here is the problem: the day comes and the accumulated experience and wisdom of the instinctive trader overtake his instincts. Fear enters the equation, especially after some big losses. He suddenly realizes that he knows nothing, that he walks on the tightrope, that he needs knowledge, education and experience. He starts reading books, taking courses, attends forums, blogs, etc etc.. and really becomes more knowledgeable than he was before.  


The problem is with the reorientation on knowledge and experience he lost his instincts ...forever...  
  
Another problem is that the knowledge he attained is theoretical.  
  
He never actually had a working trading method before (even though he thinks he had). Now he has the trading method, but his method is a hodge-podge of ideas mixed with some feelings and is not base on found by him the objective laws of the market. One can not trade the ideas and feelings successfully, regardless of how good they are.  
  
And as the result instead of running with the crowd he now runs against it, while doing almost everything what books and courses dictate.  
  
Now he faces a monumental task - becoming a truly methodical trader.",0,7,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nwxjru/beginners_luck/,new,Discussion,0.5
1nwx1i2,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 07:55:09,Losing 5 prop firm accounts doesn’t matter if one payout covers them all,"I used to approach prop firms with a “long-term survival” mentality:

* Never fail a challenge
* Never lose an account
* Play it ultra-safe, as if I’d be trading the same funded account for years

It sounds logical, but in practice it just slowed me down and made passing challenges harder than it needed to be.

Here’s what changed everything for me: I started looking at prop firms through the **payout vs. account cost ratio**.

Think about it this way:

* If I lose 5 challenges, that’s painful, sure… but one solid payout usually covers all 5 losses.
* Once you pass, the real focus isn’t “never lose the account,” it’s **maximize the payout window**. Most firms make you wait 14 days for your first payout. That’s 14 days of trading where the goal is to secure and maximize that payout.

So now my mindset is:

* **Pass quickly** (2–4 weeks per phase is the sweet spot) with an acceptable win rate.
* **Payout focus once funded**: trade actively in that 14-day window and secure as much as possible.
* If I blow the account after securing a payout, the math still works out in my favor.

This shift helped me stop stressing about “never failing” and instead treat prop firms like what they really are: a numbers game where efficiency and payouts matter more than never losing.

That's my 2 cents when it comes to prop trading.",0,11,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nwx1i2/losing_5_prop_firm_accounts_doesnt_matter_if_one/,new,Prop firms,0.5

I’ve been trading for about six years now. I started with a lot of learning and basic strategies, and then I got introduced to Guerrilla Trading (a former trading community from London). I learned their strategies, practiced on demo, and did a lot of backtesting.

I managed to pass the FTMO challenge, but ended up blowing the account. After that, I traded live with $1,000 and didn’t blow any live accounts—so I’d say I’ve developed discipline when it comes to managing emotions and sticking to a strategy.

Later, I developed a more aggressive short-term strategy based on the 15-minute chart. But after backtesting and live testing, I’m starting to doubt whether it’s actually profitable.

The Guerrilla Trading community turned out to be a scam and eventually shut down. That said, the strategy itself wasn’t terrible—I just haven’t been able to make it work profitably in the market conditions of the past 2–3 years. After losing a few thousand dollars on learning (losing is not the accurate word her, I learned a lot), testing, and FTMO attempts, I’m feeling pretty lost.

Right now, I’m nearing the end of university and starting to wonder: is this it for trading? Should I let go of the dream?

So I just want to ask—are there any full-time profitable traders here? Is it still worth pushing forward? I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts.If you’re a consistently profitable trader, please share your honest opinion.

You can only win in trading when you're thinking of probabilities of profits and losses, based on your strategy. New traders do not think of losses until they encounter one. This triggers them to reaction, which leads to revenge trading and blowing of accounts. The difference between them and experienced traders is that experienced traders know how to take losses and move on. New traders only want positive results or nothing. FYI, the market doesn't know your previous trade was a loss. So if you can take your time before getting in to the next trade, trust me you will make better decisions.

1nvhlg6,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 15:15:29,Bought at $280. RDDT down again ，Anyone Else Feeling This Pain?”？,"*Hey everyone,*

About RDDT’s price drop today, I’ve been following the news and here are some possible reasons I’ve gathered (of course I can’t be 100% sure):

\*1.\*Slowing user growth / DAU warnings. Recent reports indicate that Reddit’s daily active user growth is falling short of expectations, raising investor concerns about future traffic and user stickiness.

\*2.\*ChatGPT and AI-driven search are reducing traffic and citations from Reddit. This could mean Reddit is getting “bypassed” by AI products, weakening its platform traffic value. At the same time, Google’s AI search upgrades could be a risk for a platform like Reddit that relies heavily on search-driven traffic.

\*3.\*High valuation / overblown expectations. Reddit’s valuation was already rich, and when sentiment shifts, high-growth names often get hit first.

\*4.\*nsider selling. There have been reports of executives and founders selling shares, which can shake investor confidence. Plus, there’s skepticism about whether Reddit can really deliver on its traffic-to-revenue promises.

\*5.\*Sector pullback. Sometimes it’s not a company-specific issue but a broader risk-off move in tech/growth stocks that drags names like RDDT down.

\*6.\*Heavy volume / liquidity factors. According to Quiver Quant, today’s drop came with unusually high trading volume.

These are just the reasons I’ve been piecing together. The sad part? I bought RDDT at $280. I’m posting this to find others who might be in the same boat and hear your thoughts or strategies.

P.S. Some people say my English is bad or that I’m a bot  come on, I’m just a German guy.

At first, i didn’t want to risk much, so i started small, literally $5,  just to test the waters. with leverage, though, even that tiny amount felt exciting. and i'm not gonna lie… the inner degen in me came out.

What makes it even better is that i can now trade my favorite stocks in the same app where i already do crypto, and on top of that, i get extra rewards from campaigns. Thats a big win for me.

1nvb4vd,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 11:21:04,Started with $50 – Withdrew my capital.,"Hey traders,

I’ve been trading **XAU/USD (Gold)** on a small account and wanted to share my experience so far.

* **Closed orders:** 121
* **Profitable:** 81
* **Unprofitable:** 40
* **Starting capital:** $20
* **Withdrawn already:** $20 (my initial) + $20 profit
* **Current balance:** $79
* **Time trading:** 23 days
* **Style:** No stop loss, I babysit trades a lot and often close early because of emotions.

My questions:

1. Can I say I’m **profitable** since I already pulled out my initial $50 and extra profit?
2. Is this sustainable long-term, or am I just getting lucky?
3. For those with experience trading small accounts, how do you scale without letting emotions control your exits?

Until yesterday. My rules are: a maximum of 2 trades per day, with the second one allowed only if the first is a win; a fixed 1:2 risk–reward ratio; and no staring at the charts. I created these rules because in the past I struggled with overtrading and revenge trading.

Yesterday, I broke them. My first trade (a long) was a loss—the setup wasn’t clean at all. I stayed glued to the chart (probably because I didn’t trust the setup) and got stopped out after 30 minutes. Just five minutes later, a clean setup appeared. Based on my rules, I should have already closed my computer, but instead I kept watching.

When I took the second trade right after that loss, I became emotional and moved my stop-loss (against my rules), even though I moved it into profit. Because I tightened it too much, I got stopped out—only to watch my original take-profit level eventually get hit. That made me angry, and from there I slipped back into tilt and revenge trading mode.

In the end, I recovered part of my losses, but I felt terrible afterwards. I started the morning with $50,600 and ended the day exhausted with $49,100.",1,5,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nv7mfi/rules_broken_tilt/,new,Discussion,0.6

I wonder if it would be more useful to push tests to the extreme, applying worst-case scenarios to see if a bot can actually survive.

For example:

Increasing spread to realistic or even exaggerated values

Simulating slippage on every execution

Including liquidity constraints (partial fills, delays)

Always accounting for broker fees/commissions


The idea would be to run the strategy on live market data (demo/forward test), but applying these additional handicaps to verify if the system remains profitable even when everything is stacked against it.

Honestly, I find the hardest part isn’t designing a decent strategy, but sticking to it when emotions start kicking in.

Here are a few things we’ve learned from funded traders who survive (and grow) vs. those who crash out early:

* Respect position sizing. If you’re risking too much per trade, you won’t survive the variance.
* Cut losers fast. Hoping for a reversal is how small losses turn into big ones.
* Daily loss limits exist for a reason. They save you from emotional spirals more than you realize.
* Revenge trading is a poison. Chasing back what you lost is usually how you lose even more.
* Zoom out. Focus on weeks/months of results, not whether *today* was green or red.

1nuzhw3,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 01:05:15,My Opinion about Trading..change my mind,"Trading is the worst business model I have ever seen it lacks stability and consistency. I know some genius traders will try and tell me how the lack of consistency is with my style but I have mastered my style and for the most part of this year there were completely no setups, the market was very dry. Trading for me will forever remain a side hustle to get some windfall cash once in a while but it's a completely unreliable business model. You are not going to be paying your monthly recurring bills with it. The other thing is unless you are using a well trained bot to replace you, you always have to be there, if you are sick or have moods you make no money due to a high risk of human error. I think other business models are better because with those you can implement systems and AI easily that help it run around the clock. Take for example an online business where you create a website that does the selling for you. You can outsource product creation and you automate prospecting through running ads, all you have to do is manage the system and by this you are just watching out and controlling anomalies that may make the revenue go off track other than that you are free and the money is coming in as you do other stuff. Once you put in the upfront effort you can sit back and relax.  The business runs the majority of the time without you.Trading is not like that once you learn it you still need to be actively participating in it. The worst part about trading is once you have spent time honing these skills for years thinking it's going to be your way out of poverty you realize the skills you have been polishing are not transferrable to another industry, they are extremely niche. So if you are unable to become profitable you are fucked and have wasted a considerable amount of time and money learning something that is very restricted in industry application.This is why it generates alot of scammers, people start with good intentions hoping they will be rich, they realize its difficult to learn, they have spent years and money trying to master it but are still not profitable and that is when they realize this business aint it and they need to make up for all the time and money lost, so they decide to become the shovel sellers, selling shovels to the people going after the gold rush.",9,135,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nuzhw3/my_opinion_about_tradingchange_my_mind/,new,Discussion,0.63

   1. If you fully use the 10x leverage extension, your maximum possible order value is 1,000,000 USDC.,
   2. If you fully use the 10x leverage extension, your maximum possible order value is 100,000 USDC.,
   3. This means your Account currently holds 100,000 USDC.,
   4. You will always borrow 100,000 USDC when buying BTC.
2. *\[*23:22*\]*Your last executed trade was under 10x leverage. Your current Maintenance Margin currently is USD 10,000, the current Margin Balance in your Unified Trading Account is USD 10,500. What does this mean and what should you do next?
   1. Your Maintenance Margin Rate is close to 100%. Take action to avoid liquidation by repaying borrowed crypto-assets or depositing more collateral into your Unified Trading Account.,
   2. Your Maintenance Margin Rate is below 10%. At 10x leverage, your Margin Balance is multiplied by 10, so your liquidation risk is low.,
   3. Your Maintenance Margin Rate is close to 100%. Consider reducing your leverage to lower the overall risk in your Unified Trading Account.,
   4. You're not at risk of liquidation as long as your Maintenance Margin doesn’t drop to zero.,
3. Assuming USDC has a Collateral Value Ratio of 100% and BTC has a Collateral Value Ratio of 95%. How does the Collateral Value Ratio may impact your liquidation risk?LastNewLifeBULL *—* 23:26 
   1. The Collateral Value Ratio doesn't affect your liquidation risk. It only determines the value of crypto-assets when repaying loans.,
   2. If you hold $1,000 worth of USDC, your liquidation risk is lower than if you hold the same value in BTC.,
   3. A higher Collateral Value Ratio leads to a higher liquidation risk when borrowing crypto-assets from Bybit EU.,
   4. All BTC held in your Unified Trading Account are always subject to the same Collateral Value Ratio.,
4. *\[*23:28*\]*How does 10x leverage impact your exposure to fees?
   1. You will be exposed to higher borrowing fees but your liquidation risk does not increase, as you will only pay your borrowing fees at repayment of the crypto-asset loan.,
   2. A higher leverage level will have no impact on the amount of fees paid.,
   3. Your holding duration does not negatively impact your fee exposure as borrowing fees will only be calculated at the repayment of the crypto-asset loan.,
   4. A higher leverage level generally results in a higher amount of borrowed crypto-assets. This results in higher borrowing fees and negatively impacts your liquidation risks.,
5. *\[*23:29*\]*How does increased market volatility of ETH price impact you under Cross Margin Mode, if you hold ETH in your Unified Trading Account?
   1. You will not be impacted if you only trade a BTC/USDC pair with 10x leverage.,
   2. If you only borrow USDC, ETH price volatility won't affect your liquidation risk.,
   3. A sudden drop in ETH price could reduce your Collateral and trigger liquidation.,
   4. Repaying all your ETH loans will eliminate your liquidation risk

Question 1: Imho answer 1 and 3 are correct.  
Question 2: 1 and 3 might be correct. In reality I would try to avoid liquidation cascads here, but I felt (and chat gpt agreed) they wanna hear 1 here.

1nuqgo1,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 17:53:49,Bringing Hedge Fund/Mid Frequency Trading to the Masses,"I have been a quant trader in high frequency trading (e.g. IMC, Optiver, Citadel, HRT, Jane) for 10+ years. I have made enough to retire comfortably but I've been ruminating quitting my job to change the finance industry. Most of the mid-frequency trading strategies (stocks, options, cryptos) have high sharpe and are not too difficult to replicate. I have talked to my friends at hedge funds, long-short equity funds and they feel similarly. However, retail investors have historically not have had access to these strategies.

The platform would serve as a bridge for talented traders and quants—whether experienced professionals or successful independent day traders—who want to run their own strategies outside of traditional institutions. Each trader would have a profile featuring their background, optional backtests, and high-level strategy information. Customers could review these profiles, allocate capital to the traders they trust, and have trades automatically executed in their IBKR accounts on a proportional basis. Traders would only see aggregated assets under management, not individual portfolios. Traders would get management fees and/or profit share but this would be much lower than traditional institutions. However, this model has its limitations including execution quality and limitations around implementing certain complex options strategies

I know currently there are copy trade platforms (e.g. eToro, Echo Trade, Autopilot etc) but they all seem a bit scammy/meme. In **Phase II**, the goal would be to evolve into a licensed custodian, enabling execution through advanced venues such as dark pools, lit markets, RFQs, and auctions. This would significantly improve execution quality for customers. Additionally, this would enable fractionalization of equities and options, allowing traders to implement more sophisticated strategies typically reserved for institutional funds. Over time, as the user base grows, we would also invest in infrastructure—such as microwave networks and colocation facilities—to compete more effectively with high-frequency trading firms. To protect investors, traders would operate under defined risk and drawdown limits, ensuring disciplined portfolio management and preventing excessive risk-taking.

1nufjlk,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 11:01:06,The Hidden Edge in Trading Is Removing Decisions,"The secret is to stop making decisions. Make a profitable system grounded in logic with predefined rules regarding the entry logic for every entry, risk management and trade management ahead of time; with that, you won't need to think about anything when pressing the button. Design your strategy so specifically that you have at least a good idea where your target, stop and entry are before your entry signal completes.

**It's so much easier to be disciplined if you know the exact thing you're looking for on every trading session, people underestimate this. Ditch grandiose frameworks and trade something pre-defined, repeatable and real.**

[Example Purposes Only](https://reddit.com/link/1nufjlk/video/hxevid198hsf1/player)

Example: When you don't have to think about where your target is because you know the specific rules and sequence for every possible target things become ultra-relaxed.

Before my formation is complete I know where my entry price, stop, and target are on most iterations. **That's real freedom. Zero decision fatigue.**

The only decision I leave myself with is putting that trade on.

It’s the hours spent in front of a screen while the rest of the world goes on without you. It’s friends not understanding why you’d rather journal your trades than go out. It’s family asking if this is “just a phase” while you quietly build a future they can’t imagine.



That silence is heavy but it’s also where the magic happens.



In the quiet, you find focus.

In the routine, you find strength.

In the loneliness, you find yourself.



Trading isn’t about noise, it’s about peace. The freedom you’re chasing won’t come from being understoo,it comes from doing the work when no one is watching.



So if you feel distant, disconnected, even misunderstood, know this: you’re not lost. You’re just walking a road most people will never dare to step on. And if you keep going, the freedom, the success, the peace… it will all be worth it.

* The layout's super straightforward. I tried other sites before but they felt kind of overwhelming, this one just lets me focus on practising.
* I like being able to look back and see how I did over time-it makes it easier to spot when I'm falling into bad habits (like jumping into trades too fast).

Paper trading feels inefficient, mostly because most people don't use it long enough to truly test and validate their strategies. And if they would, then it would take years! And even if you did everything perfectly, then you woudn't get the emotional strength required for trading.

So at least i've hoped to solve the first part of the equation: getting data. I've also tried to gamify it by introducing ranked seasons, where every month is a new season.

This collaborative post by me, SentientPnL (Ron), and SentientAnalyser (Ali) combines institutional-grade research with carefully selected citations. It will give you grounded insights into how markets work, market efficiencies, trading psychology, reasoning, the declining effectiveness of public strategies (alpha decay), and much more.

This post covers just about everything. This isn't a generic resources dump this has been carefully picked for optimal absorption.

**I have formatted this optimally so both readers and skimmers can gain valuable insights.**

# Academic and Institutional Studies & Serious Books

**This document is for anyone curious about the reasoning behind our process and thinking, or for those seeking deep trading knowledge.**

***Pause and read when something piques your interest. Judge by citation.***

**1. Random Walk & Market Efficiency**

**Eugene Fama - THE BEHAVIOR OF STOCK-MARKET PRICES**

**Key Part:**

“By contrast the theory of random walks says that the future path of the price level of a security is no more predictable than the path of a series of cumulated random numbers. In statistical terms the theory says that successive price changes are independent, identically distributed random variables. Most simply this implies that the series of price changes has no memory, that is, the past cannot be used to predict the future in any meaningful way”

**Note:**  
We are not suggesting the market is 100% efficient/random. We referenced this to show how randomness in a market isn’t good for your bottom line. The more efficient/random a market is the harder it is to trade profitably

**Eugene Fama - Random Walks in Stock Market Prices.**

**Key Takeaway:**

if the random-walk theory is an accurate description of reality, then the various “technical” or “chartist” procedures for predicting stock prices are completely without value.

 

**Burton Malkiel - A Random Walk Down Wall Street**

**Key Lines:**

“A random walk is one in which future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past history. When the term is applied to the stock market, it means that short-run changes in stock prices are unpredictable”

“Mathematicians call a sequence of numbers produced by a random process (such as those on our simulated stock chart) a random walk. The next move on the chart is completely unpredictable on the basis of what has happened before.” – **Referencing Random Candlestick Charts**

[A Random Chart](https://preview.redd.it/vub60qytg4sf1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d82d67028281adb41fc414a6e4cc7c8c85bfa2d)

[Another random chart designed to look like S&P 500 Futures \(ES\)](https://preview.redd.it/bl1fhs0wg4sf1.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=714b9c45ad9d847d4ecf8559d79ea41bb4449868)

**The core lesson of the random‐walk theory is that you cannot predict future market price movements by studying historical data if the market is 100% random.**

 

**2. Alpha/Market Edge Decay & Why no profitable trader would sell or give away their strategy for free.\[1\]**

**Julien Penasse - Understanding Alpha Decay**

 

**Highlights that alpha (edge over market) tends to diminish. alpha decay is generally a nonstationary phenomenon/inconsistent. Julien leverages studied anomalies for credibility.**

**Key Parts:** “Because alpha decay is generally a non-stationary phenomenon, asset pricing tests that impose stationarity may lead to biased inference. I illustrate the importance of alpha decay using the most commonly-studied anomalies in the asset pricing literature”

“Alpha decay refers to the reduction in abnormal expected returns (relative to an asset pricing model) in response to an anomaly becoming widely known among market participants” **\[1\]**

 

**This is popular, modern and potent evidence that alpha decay and edge decay is real.**

**Does Academic Research Destroy Stock Return Predictability? - Journal of Finance, R. David McLean**

**Published in 2016**

**Key takeaway:**

“Portfolio returns are 26% lower out-of-sample and 58% lower post-publication. The out-of-sample decline is an upper bound estimate of data mining effects. We estimate a 32% (58% - 26%) lower return from publication-informed trading.”

 

**On the Effect of Alpha Decay and Transaction Costs on the Multi-period Optimal Trading Strategy** by Chutian Ma and Paul Smith (2025):

The approach shown on this paper captures the essence of alpha decay by allowing the strength of signals to wane as they age, reflecting reality where the effectiveness of trading signals decrease over time. Re-enforcing the idea of edge / alpha decay.

Present in the ABSTRACT: **“To simulate alpha decay, we consider a case where not only the present value of a signal, but also past values, have predictive power”**

 

**High frequency market making: The role of speed - Yacine Aït-Sahalia, Mehmet Sağlam**

Short paper, quick read

**3. Intraday Seasonality & Session‐Based Rules**

**Admati & Pfleiderer - A Theory of Intraday Patterns**

**Key Parts:**

Paper documents intraday volume & volatility U‐shape across NYSE hours.

Ex Table 1 show how volume and volatility vary through NYSE hours.

**4. Mean Reversion vs. Trending Characterization**

**Intraday mean-reversion after open shocks: Grant, Wolf, and Yu (2005) document strong reversal effects in US equity index futures**

**Key Lines:**

This paper gives a long-term assessment of intraday price reversals in the US stock index futures market following large price changes at the market open. We find highly significant intraday price reversals over a 15-year period (November 1987-September 2002) as well as significant intraday reversals in our yearly and day-of-the-week investigations. Moreover, the strength of the intraday overreaction phenomenon seems more pronounced following large positive price changes at the market open.

 That being said, the question of whether a trader can consistently profit from this information remains open as the significance of intraday price reversals is sharply reduced when gross trading results are adjusted by a bid-ask proxy for transactions costs.

 

**Rama Cont - Empirical Properties of Asset Returns**

**Key Lines:**

Table 1 lists “Volatility Clustering” and “Gain/loss asymmetry” i.e Mean reversion characteristics for major indices.

 

**5. Backtesting**

**Bailey, López de Prado & Zhu - Pseudo‐Mathematics and Financial Charlatanism**

**Key Lines**

We prove that high simulated performance is easily achievable after backtesting a relatively small number of alternative strategy configurations, a practice we denote ‘backtest overfitting

The higher the number of configurations tried, the greater is the probability that the backtest is overfit... Under memory effects, backtest overfitting leads to negative expected returns out-of-sample, rather than zero performance.

**6. Order Flow, Microstructure and how markets work**

**Albert S. Kyle - Continuous Auctions and Insider Trading**

**Key Lines for us:**

**Albert S. Kyle** “Perhaps the most interesting properties concern the liquidity characteristics of the market in a continuous auction equilibrium. ""Market liquidity"" is a slippery and elusive concept, in part because it encompasses a number of transactional properties of markets. These include ""tightness"" (the cost of turning around a position over a short period of time), ""depth"" (the size of an order flow innovation required to change prices a given amount), and ""resiliency"" (the speed with which prices recover from a random, uninformative shock). Black \[2\] describes intuitively a liquid market in the following manner: ""The market for a stock is liquid if the following conditions hold: (1) There are always bid and asked prices for the investor who wants to buy or sell small amounts of stock immediately. (2) The difference between the bid and asked prices (the spread) is always small”

Kyle breaks down what Market liquidity is and What makes a market liquid showing that imbalances between buyers and sellers i.e. imbalance in liquidity is the reason why price moves. To us this is obvious but many traders don’t consider it.

 

**Trading and Exchange: Market microstructure for practitioners - Larry Harris**

Parts 1.5, 3.10, and 3.11 were well written and more on point; Part 3.12 is an amusing read too.

It’s a lot less intense when comparing to market microstructure theory, and he uses humorous terms which keep things engaging, making it a nice gateway.

 

**Maureen O’Hara - Market Microstructure Theory**

**Key Chapters:**

Chapter 1-5 covers how liquidity and order flow mechanics underpin price formation.

**Maureen O’Hara - High Frequency Market Microstructure**

**This paper reveals how modern markets are different and contains heavy discussion of HFT involvement in modern markets.**

 

**How CFDs work (Example of a regulated CFD broker)**

CFD Customer agreement key parts: 12.8b 21.1 and so on

IG INDEX UK CUSTOMER AGREEMENT

 

**How DMA/Exchange Markets work**

Algorithmic Trading and DMA: An introduction to direct access trading strategies - Barry Johnson

Chapter 2-4 are my favourite

**The most dense book I’ve ever explored.**

This book is intense; it goes into legitimately everything that you’d ever need to know about order flow mechanics, microstructure facts and more. It’s straight-up excessive and worth every penny.  Citing the book here saves this document from being 100+ pages.

When I say “excessive”, I’m telling you, you’ll know what a Multilateral trading facility is, ECNs, LPs, MMs all of it.

**7. Trader Psychology**

**Born to choose: the origins and value of the need for control**

Lauren A Leotti 1, Sheena S Iyengar, Kevin N Ochsner

The innate feeling of needing to be in control of outcome in human psychology (The root of most trading pain & desire for discretion in trading)

**Present in the ABSTRACT:**

""Belief in one's ability to exert control over the environment and to produce desired results is essential for an individual's wellbeing. It has repeatedly been argued that perception of control is not only desirable, but is also probably a psychological and biological necessity. In this article, we review the literature supporting this claim and present evidence of a biological basis for the need for control and for choice-that is, the means by which we exercise control over the environment. Converging evidence from animal research, clinical studies and neuroimaging suggests that the need for control is a biological imperative for survival, and a corticostriatal network is implicated as the neural substrate of this adaptive behavior.""

**The Role of Financial Instruments in Reducing Exchange Rate Risk Vlora Berisha, Rrustem Asllanaj**

\- For context from Ron: Total Return Swaps (TRS) and Contract for Difference (CFDs) are similar in that both allow you to gain exposure to an asset’s price changes/performance without owning it outright. You benefit from price changes and, depending on the contract & type even receive or pay income like dividends or interest. Both involve paying financing costs if you hold positions overnight (swap fees)

# Definitions written by Ali (SentientAnalyzer)

**1.Constraints**

What limits you - time, capital, lifestyle. These set the boundaries for what you can actually trade. Your system must respect them.

**2. Market Type**

Behaviour of a market: mean reverting, trending, or random/alternating.

**3. Valid Trading Window**

The hours when you’re allowed to trade. Based on where volume and volatility are, not your convenience.

**4. Risk (R)**

The set amount of capital you’re willing to lose per trade. Fixed, consistent. Example: 1R = 3%.

**5. RRR**

Risk-to-reward ratio (e.g. 1:3 = risk $100 to make $300).

**6. Order-Flow Mechanics**

Price moves because buyers and sellers are imbalanced. That’s it. It explains rejections and moves - it’s not an edge, it’s just reality.

**7. 3-Wick Setup**

Three wicks rejecting a level - signals price has repeated selling activity and won’t break through. Must be rule-based, not subjective.

**8. Tick**

The smallest price increment on an instrument.

**9. Execution**

Cost Spreads, commissions, and slippage affecting net performance. Ignore it and your edge vanishes.

**10. Backtest**

Testing your rules on past data. Done honestly - no scrolling, no cherrypicking, no hindsight. Bar Replay below in

**11. Overfitting**

When your strategy works only on the past because you’ve shaped it to work on past historical data instead of applying and idea to historical data. Looks good in testing, fails live.

**12. Stress Test**

Deliberately run your system in bad conditions. These are notable periods of intraday chop, low volume on trend trading strategies and periods of relentless trends on mean reversion/reversal strategies. If it collapses, it’s weak.

Example: Someone could be running a mean reversion day trading system on YM and he could stress test August 8th to September 13th 2024 as an example, where, here Dow Jones exhibited strong trending behaviour which is against the system’s nature.

**13. Bar Replay Play**

charts forward candle by candle to mimic real-time. Helps you test if you’d actually take your setups live. E.g., TradingView Bar Replay

**14. Scaling In**

Adding size after entry. Must be planned and tested - not just done because “it looks good”.

**15. Hedge**

Open a position benefiting from movements in the opposite direction. Useful at times, but messy if you don’t have clear rules.

**16. Breakeven/Partials**

Closing part/all of the trade early. Often reduces long-term edge unless justified by data.

**17. Ghost Liquidity**

Orders that aren’t visible but sit around visible levels. Cause sharp reactions or none at all. It’s just a surge of liquidity that isn’t visible on the books.

**18. Random Walk**

Price sometimes moves like noise. Most patterns don’t work unless they’re backed by logic. A Random Walk is a market that is 100% random. In other words, it is effectively a completely efficient market where no edge is possible. Real markets are of course different.

**19. Bracketed Limit Orders**

Pre-set entry, stop, and take-profit. Forces discipline. Removes intuition and discretion.

**20. Institutional Narrative Fallacy**

The idea that “smart money” always leaves clues. Usually marketing fluff. If it’s not testable, it’s not valid.

**21. Data Snooping**

Repeatedly looking at a data series from different angles to confirm something that you haven’t defined ahead of time often leading to insignificant and/or biased discoveries. Essentially looking too hard for patterns and finding things that don’t actually repeat. Typically kills forward performance.

**22. Drawdown**

How far your strategy drops from peaks in tests. Crucial for knowing how big your positions should be in advance. For example, a trader could have a max losing streak of 8 but your peak to trough could be 12x your risk (some wins followed by strings of losses repeatedly create this) – Super important to track and know. That’s the maximum drawdown you should be taking into account especially if working with prop firms.

**23. Dynamic Targeting**

Set targets based on real market structure - swing highs, lows, clusters of wicks. not arbitrary price movements e.g., 100 points, 100 handles, 100 pips, 100 ticks. Market is too dynamic for a one size fits all.

**24. Expectancy**

The average gain or loss per trade. Strategies don’t need high win rates - it needs consistency in the data and logical backing: Expectancy = average win × win rate − (1 − win rate) × average loss.

**25. Logic-Driven Rule** A rule built on how the market behaves - not what a shape on a chart looks like or some untested theory. For example purposes only, using the 3 wicks example. Bar 1 closes with a wick high; this shows that there was selling pressure. If the next candle interacts with bar 1’s high but fails to close above, creating another wick, it shows continued selling pressure. If on bar 3 it happens again, it shows compounded selling pressure. If it reverses, it should do so quickly. If price continues beyond the wicks, price should continue trending. Using a small stop loss relative to the target can create an edge if costs are managed properly.

**Daily Chart (D1)**

We continue to maintain the bullish projection of the triangle, with a target toward the **3860 USD** level.

The bullish intent remains valid, although it is beginning to show signs of weakening.

We detect a **bearish divergence** between the price and our **SmartMass** indicator, which indicates that the upward momentum is weakening and could anticipate a correction or consolidation before resuming its upward drive.

The key support to watch is around the **3700–3720 USD** zone, coinciding with previous price reaction levels and technical projections.

**4H Chart (H4)**

The price has reached a very high momentum, moving significantly away from the main trend.

The upward movement is approaching a **parabolic move**, which is usually associated with impulsive climax phases.

The **SmartMass** indicator confirms this reading, showing signs of excessive momentum and suggesting that a **two-leg correction** is likely to test the main trend line.

Currently, the price has formed a **final flag pattern (FF ch)** of a channel type, which could anticipate the start of a significant correction within the overall trend.

**Technical projection:** the first corrective leg could take the price toward the approximate level of **3707 USD**, corresponding to the end of the second leg (**LEG2**).

1nspxmr,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 10:36:53,Market Conditions and Sector Strategy," The 1990s Market Environment 

In the 1990s, the U.S. stock market experienced a period of rapid and extraordinary growth, largely fueled by the dot-com boom. Technology stocks surged as investors poured money into internet-based companies, many of which had little to no earnings. During this period, annual returns averaged an astonishing 16.1%, nearly double the historical average. This unrestrained optimism eventually created the dot-com bubble, which burst in the early 2000s, leading to a sharp decline in valuations and painful lessons for many investors. 

Today’s Market Conditions In contrast, today’s market is more balanced, though not without challenges. The S\&P; 500 is showing modest growth, reflecting investor optimism, but several headwinds exist. Persistent inflation and the introduction of new tariffs add uncertainty, reminding traders to approach the market strategically. Analysts see some similarities to the 1990s in the form of high enthusiasm for technology-driven growth. However, the modern market benefits from a more informed investor base and stronger regulatory oversight. Today’s optimism is backed by tangible advancements in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and electric vehicles—sectors with clear long-term potential, unlike many of the speculative dot-com startups of the past. 

The Role of Sector Rotation Sector rotation continues to be a critical strategy for traders and investors. During expansion phases of the economy, cyclical sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary, and industrials often outperform. On the other hand, when markets weaken or uncertainty rises, defensive sectors like healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities tend to provide stability. Understanding these cycles allows traders to anticipate shifts and position their portfolios accordingly, capturing opportunities while managing risk. 

Swing Trading and Sector Awareness For swing traders, combining sector rotation principles with short-to-medium-term positions can be especially effective. Swing traders can use sector ETFs to gain broad exposure, while also selecting individual stocks that align with the prevailing sector trend. Reviewing sector performance weekly and making timely adjustments helps traders remain in sync with the market’s rhythm. This blend of strategy adds both flexibility and diversification to a swing trading approach. 

Conclusion 

While today’s market offers growth opportunities, it also carries risks that demand careful attention. Unlike the unchecked exuberance of the 1990s, the current environment is a mix of optimism and caution. By staying adaptable, focusing on sectors aligned with the economic cycle, and blending broader awareness with specific trades, investors and traders can position themselves for success in a complex and evolving market.",1,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nspxmr/market_conditions_and_sector_strategy/,new,Technical analysis,1.0

I have been trading for 3 years, focused on index warrants, and I want to get serious about quantifying risk, drawdowns, and position sizing using probability and statistics.

Here’s my setup:

* \~300 trades/year
* I don’t use stop losses. Losing positions are held until reversal, historically \~14 days on average. I roll over warrants with a 9–12 month expiration window
* I trade both directions (calls and puts)
* Occasionally, extreme trades happen: \~2 per year were historically “unrecoverable.” I either offset them gradually with profits or, if critical, cut them and move on.
* I currently use fractional Kelly (\~1/6) for position sizing.

My goals:

1. Estimate the tail risk of ruin and portfolio survival over multiple years, accounting for different trade counts.
2. Optimize position sizing / Kelly fraction considering the above risk calculations.

I have intermediate Python skills. I’m looking for practical guidance on where to start and focus, which methods/theories are directly applied to this case.

It struck me instantly when I started learning about it and it grew a part of me which I didn't know I had; I truly enjoyed the dirty work, my mind shifted towards the mindset of ""work hard now, be free later"". And I loved it. When I woke up in the morning I had that burning fire in me, comparable to the feeling you get the day you'd take the plane going on vacation.

I was learning quick and worked towards surrounding myself with likeminded people online since none of my friends were willing to take the leap. As you'd expect the first year, I didn't achieve mind blowing results, though I made profits the year being 2024 meaning it was green everywhere for crypto (I mainly trade BTC). My dad supported me from the start, always being there to hear about my breakthroughs, struggles and growth; Or so I thought. He started off small asking about my profits and how it was going. But I had hit a threshold after the bull run turned into a sideways market so I didn't have much to show. I was effectively going sideways with the market for a couple of months. That's when I learnt my dad actually thought trading didn't work: ”I don’t believe it works” - “Focus on your studies it’s more important than this crap you’re doing” - “You’re better off investing your time in something valuable for your studies” were his words. All of a sudden the only person I confided to and thought would always support me was gone. This was in June of 2024 and ever since that day, my life has been going downhill. Not too long after that I lost contact with most of my trading connections due to them graduating high-school and moving on from trading.

To talk a bit more about my trading style which is important to the story, I usually take 1to 5 trades a week solely depending on the market conditions. 
I consider my strategy to be the ""rare occurrence high win rate"" type. I find it complicated back-testing it as it's not an easy enough concept that I can code to test on previous markets or find myself in a short amount of time (30-45min per trade). On a small sample of 17 of  trades ranging from 2.5RR to 5RR, I made money on 65% of them, 47% hit full TP and only 29% lost me money. Now I know this might be just luck, but keep in mind those were live trades, following my perfected plan which I found not too long ago (November 2024 - February 2025 is the timeline for the testing).
So there I was, all alone with just my will to keep going. I somehow managed to last the whole winter locked in on my goals. The end of the school year was approaching and my dad had to add on my struggle, giving me ""The father’s speech"" as a lot may have already experienced it. This time I understood by his tone he wasn't joking around anymore. He pressured me to let go of trading and focus on my exams coming up in a couple of months. For the next couple of months, every time I opened up, my parents’ eyes fell on my hard work with contempt, crushing the pride I had felt only moments before.

I'm closing in on my last season to prove them wrong before I graduate. I don't feel anything anymore when I open the charts even though I have tradingview set as a startup app; I just close the window immediately. I would do anything to go back to how it was. I don't know what I'm looking for by typing this out but I would say this is bringing me one step closer to making it out of this hole.

1ns61iy,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 16:53:17,Why I left traditional brokers for onchain stocks,"Back in 2019, when crypto was slow, i tried using traditional stock brokers. at first, i thought it would give me more options, but it turned out to be frustrating. i could only trade during market hours, which felt like waiting for a school bell to ring. the apps were slow and not easy to use compared to crypto platforms, and the whole process felt old and stressful, with too many steps just to buy or sell.

this year, i found onchain stocks with bitget, and it honestly feels like a shortcut to the future. i can buy tokenized versions of popular stocks and ETFs anytime i want, without waiting for markets to open. i have even bought stocks late at night and on weekends, and it worked perfectly.

for me, the best part is the freedom, no fixed hours, no complicated steps, just simple trading 24/7. this feels like how investing should be in 2025. if you’re still using traditional brokers, i don’t know how you manage, because once you try onchain, going back is almost impossible.",1,2,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ns61iy/why_i_left_traditional_brokers_for_onchain_stocks/,new,Discussion,0.57

1ns0d47,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 13:01:54,You lose because you don’t understand averaging down,"Somewhere some guru heard a hedge fund guy talk about averaging down. And then the guru took that gambling mentality and sold it as a strategy. Most of the time it works.

Listen carefully.

Most of the time it works.

That’s the trap. 

When it doesn’t. Game over.

You’ve been doing it wrong. Again. Stop it. Pay attention. And learn how to stop losing. 

If I average down, I’m usually spot trading. I don’t do this for options as that’s already set for optimal convexity. 

Your SL should be away from the violence. I mean way away. Like whatever you think is away, more away. 

Your SL is in the back with the binoculars watching the fight carefully. That’s where your max loss is. 

Again. Max loss. So if that’s 1% that would be there. A huge ass swing in the wrong direction and then it takes you out at one percent.

Now, when you enter, don’t enter in your full position. Wait. If it goes on, fine let it. You can scale in later. 

But now, if it pulls back. Get in again. Now what you’re doing is sort of averaging your midpoint of the trade. You’re getting a better entry and if price keeps going the wrong way, you’re risking less than your full 1%. 

Then when you get the confirmation going back in your direction, enter again, and when it breaks the high or low, enter one more. 

Congratulations, you now know how average down and to scale into any one of your stupid strategies to give you a better chance at obtaining an edge. 

Your guru is lying to you. Stop listening to them. They don’t know what they are talking about. You just don’t know enough to know how stupid they all sound.

1nri4d0,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 21:00:28,Winrate and ROI are meaningless,"Only fake gurus brag about it.

Capitalizing on edges when they present themselves is all about management of risk.

Whats wiser?

Risking 80% of your cash to make 30% 

Risking 20% of your cash to make 20%

Or risking 5% of your cash to make 10%.

Most people fall for the trap of thinking winrate and ROI mean something when they don’t. It’s how people sign up for services and suddenly they start to lose money. Or follow gurus who suddenly start to fall.

People do not know how to analyze risk.

So let’s look at some numbers.

Here are some stats from one of the funds I transparently show to the public.

Correlation to S&P - .511
Sharpe Ratio - 1.37
Sortino Ratio - 1.88
Beta - .46 
Alpha - .06

Lets breakdown what this shit means. I move with the market half the time. Depending who you ask that’s either a good or bad thing. 

Sharpe is a measurement of return for the risk deployed. Excellent would be 1.5. Mine sits pretty. Not the best. But it indicates I’m a decent performer. 

Sortino measures downside volatility. How effective one is when the market turns against the portfolio. 1.88 is fucking baller. My largest drawdown this year lasted for five days during the tariff shock in April. And even then it was just a theoretical loss as it stemmed from the extrinsic value skyrocketing during that time. Ended the month in profit. My lowest month this year was a loss of .1%. This is where I shine.

Beta measures my volatility against the stock market. Default is 1. Over 1 and you have wilder swings than the market. Lower than one means your less volatile then the market. Low beta could imply lower returns and high beta could imply higher risks. I’m consistently less volatile than the market as I prefer scalable and predictable outcomes.

Alpha measures how much better you’re expected to perform beyond the market given the risk deployed. I’m expected to beat expected performance given the risk by 6%. This implies my edge is institutional grade.

So when you summate it all it implies that my results will likely outperform the market on half the volatility that the market would provide with limited downside risk. 

I am over 20% for the year cumulatively and I’m currently compounding over 50% annual returns.  

Now… ROI has some meaning when you see the entire picture.

My winrate is 54.8% solely because I hedge and trade a lot of spreads. Because of the complexity of my trading it would be foolish to even consider winrate as a feature to brag about. When I’m trimming any spread almost always I’m cutting a loss and a winner at the same time. Generally the winner being more than the loser.

So when the guru starts bragging about his 90% winrate and 200% ROI, go look at the ridiculous risks it took to get there and see how it isn’t sustainable when you learn how to read and understand risk.

Demand transparency from anyone offering you any advice even if it’s free.

1nrg244,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 19:20:35,The sheer reality of gurus.,"In the business of finance, when you have an edge you want to leverage that edge. Meaning, for the same work that you do you want to keep doing that same work and you’ll exponentially grow. 

When you have an edge, it’s literally just a money printer at that point that can only end up printing more money. Nobody is going to sell that or give it away when you can profit immensely off of it.

Edges aren’t infinite. They are finite.

The market is ridiculously efficient. So efficient that you could think you have an edge for years just for the market to rip it away because of unforeseen risks you have no concept to mitigate. 

So, how gurus even come to be is that like you, they tried something. But they caught a winning variance. Like you, they want to show that off and be the next big top guru. They force themselves to take bigger risks or the already big risks they take get negated by the efficient frontier. 

They need money. They want the lifestyle. So they turn to sell the system that they used and got lucky on. They’ll only show you want they want to show you.

They’ll tell you that you have to learn for yourself. They’ll even tell you that signal services are garbage. 

And that’s true too. Most are trash. Nearly all our trash. Wait until my competing funds realize the AI bots they are implementing don’t work for shit when the market flips. Ya boy is gonna 10x again. 

These lying gurus have created an environment of bs on what it required to be profitable. You know this. You truly do. You’re not stupid. Well… the gamblers are. They’ll chase that dopamine to the ends of the earth. Thank god for them. Without stupid traders, winners wouldn’t have anyone to profit from. 

But to do what you’re attempting is lunacy. Maybe you can get there. Doubt it. 

But not the way you’re going about it. Your guru lied to you.

Stop blaming yourself for not getting it and start blaming the phonies who are lying to you. 

Rebel against it. Demand absolute proof. Not just of gurus. Of anyone giving you advice on trading.

Everyone wants to feel like the teacher when they should shut up and focus on being worthy to begin with. And in this game, trading.

It comes down to one thing and one thing only.

Money. 

That’s it.

VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 is gaining traction as enterprises seek private cloud alternatives with AI-ready capabilities, lifting segment margins to 77%. 

Shares are up 46.2% year-to-date, outperforming peers, though valuation now trades at a forward P/E of 38.4x. Despite momentum, investors face a reminder: VMware recently agreed to a [$102.5M securities settlement](https://11th.com/cases/vmware-investor-settlement), underscoring lingering governance concerns.



**Key Highlights**

* Infrastructure Software revenue +17% YoY to $6.8B, 43% of total sales.
* Gross margin expanded 300 bps to 93% post-VMware integration.
* Operating margin surged to 77%, reflecting scale efficiencies.
* VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 positions AVGO for AI/cloud workloads.
* $102.5M settlement tied to VMware backlog disclosures weighs on $AVGO trust

Can a trader perform better by coding a mediocare but profitable strategy(2-3% per month as a extrapolated average from a long period) to a bot and just let it do the work, i know there will be alot of blown accounts on the way but this may get disgustingly profitable once the trader starts scaling to copy trading 20-30 accounts?and not to mention the initial hurdle of passing the eval, however nowadays even that is optional and an individual can get straight to trading and making profits.

Mainly because this pessimism is exactly what I'm hoping to address. Trading being a 'losing game' and everyone 'should just quit' because no one can hold a candle against larger institutions with all of the data, compute, experience and sweet dollar bills that they have... Yeah, I honestly should just go work for Wendy's but f--- that! We deserve better tools, and there is a convergence of factors that are making this possible to give broader access to things to make this a little easier to people like us. Developments in AI are no joke in terms of a huge step towards leveling the playing field, and I believe every trader will have an AI assistant suggesting, a finance support chat bot on brokerages at the very least, which will then evolve in the very near future.  
  
I think my main goal here is to provide some context. I am not alone in this endeavor, and am working with two AI/ML data scientists/senior engineers. I used to work for a hedge fund, and the three of us all worked together at an AI startup where we realized that what we, and a ton of other 'AI startups' were doing wasn't even really using/a good use case for AI. Bubble material, fs. Them, having been interested in algorithmic trading/me having worked in the trading space myself made us all think about the obvious appeal of using RL/ML to craft a tool to take the tedium out of algorithmic strategy development. Having run through several iterations myself it is a major pain in the a\*\* to locate indicators/backtest/tweakparams/tadjust for risk/repeat.

It struck us that if we could execute and build a tool that truly leverages AI and works, that we could have a shot at giving more people like ourselves, or people who have been beaten down by the markets a better shot at creating a winning strategy. Not saying we are going to beat the market, just that we should all have access to something that makes it even just a little easier to maybe possibly start compounding risk-free profits like Jane Street.

The discouragement is super valid, and it's motivating! Not because I want to prove anyone wrong, I've got nothing to prove, but because I think anyone interested in leveraging AI to create an algorithmic trading strat should be able to, and if we can crack this maybe we have a shot at leveling the playing field even a little bit. Idk, I'm done ranting now, and will go back to building a tool for ya'll. Much love, and may your charts be green.

1nqyeoe,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 07:05:10,You’re losing because you don’t know when to take the right action.,"Your fake guru taught you it’s so simple. You can beat a trillion dollar a day market with just a simple strategy that you do over and over again. 

But when you look around, nobody is making any consistent money doing it. If you were forced to show your trading record in this group, nearly all of you are not profitable with an edge. 

Just seems that way because people only brag about their wins and never show their full transparency. Y’all bust nuts over funding certificates as if that means anything. 3% of people pass challenges, and of those 1% keep a funded account for a year or more. Wrap your head around that one. If you’re doing what everyone else is doing, how the fuck are you going to get into the top 1% of the top 3%?

The strategies you all have chosen are all various hedging tools that you’ve turned into a slot machine.

Each strategy is designed to be unique for the market you’re trading in.

Example. Let’s say earnings are coming up for NVDA. You’re long. Your market bias is long . But you’re concerned the market might move against you. You may have heard of lotto. But a real purpose for that would be to potentially catch the downside action if the stock were to just rip down. So you might buy a put lotto just in case. It’s cheap. And if you don’t want to pay for it, you can cover the upside with a deep OTM call and use those proceeds. 

Now you’re protected. Proper use of a lotto, and you don’t care if it loses, because it was only there to hedge.

Understand profit is made in hedging. You might have heard that the average hedge fund returns 7-8% a year. But what you don’t understand is that 7-8% came from virtually no risk because the markets were hedged. Wealth doesn’t care about doubling accounts. It cares about preservation of wealth.

Most of you will bust when the bear market hits and quit. Because you’re disillusioned by the idea that you think you have an edge but you don’t even want to learn about risk to reward. Listen. Your winrate don’t mean shit. Your ROÍ don’t mean shit.

What was the risk to get the reward. What was that risk in relation to the market where you can just buy and hold. Importantly, what’s your alpha? That’s your ability to profit from the market outside of market momentum. Example might be going long on a stock when the sector itself is crashing, yet you come out with a win.

I promise you, it’s not your psychology that’s failing you. It’s your lack of knowledge on how to trade the financial markets, and the non transparent FTC and SEC investigated influencers told you it was simple.

Well they wouldn’t get you to buy in if you knew absolutely how complex it is to make consistent income over years of time without having to resort to selling to others because you lacked an edge in the end.

You need an arsenal of weaponry, not some stupid set up you think is gonna change your life forever. Maybe, if you’re lucky. But luck isn’t reliable. And edge is. Learn how to read risk immediately or you you will never get to 2-3% monthly returns consistently.

1nqqzzc,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 23:32:49,Backtest results from a neural network,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a personal project I've been working on. This isn't a post to sell anything or promise crazy returns, but rather a showcase of a robust machine learning framework I've developed. The goal was to see if I could build a process that generates a real, verifiable edge, even under difficult market conditions.

For this test, I chose ETHUSD specifically because its price action was choppy and difficult for a significant portion of the backtest period. Here are the high-level results:

    ==================================================
     Results for: v1.9 Daily Model on ETHUSD
     Strategy: 'dynamic_threshold' (T+1 Pricing)
     Date Range: 2024-06-20 to 2025-01-01
    ==================================================
    Starting Capital: $1,000.00
    Ending Capital:   $2,065.49
    Total Return:     106.55%
    --------------------------------------------------
    Total Trades:     41
    Win Rate:         65.85%
    Profit Factor:    6.68
    Max Drawdown:     -8.17%
    ==================================================
    

Now, I know the first reaction to any backtest is skepticism, as it should be. Here are the three most important things about the methodology behind these numbers:

**1. This isn't just a one-off strategy; it's a generalizable framework.** The model's features are based on a proprietary method I developed called the TCXA framework, which models the underlying ""grammar"" of market structure. The same feature engineering and training pipeline that produced this ETH model gets similar results on every asset I've trained it on - BTC, ADA, DOGE. The system is a ""model factory,"" not a single, curve-fit strategy.  

**2. It's rigorously tested on out-of-sample data.** This is not a case of training and testing on adjacent data. The model used for this backtest was trained on data from **2016 through the end of 2023**. The test period you see above begins in **June 2024**, leaving a **6-month gap** of unseen data between training and testing. This is a crucial step to ensure the model has learned real patterns, not just memorized recent price action.  In other tests, I've trained form 2014-2018, tested for 2024 and still got results.  Not as good, but comparable.

**3. The backtest is realistic and free of lookahead bias.** This is the most important point. I've spent more time on the data integrity and MLOps pipeline than on the model itself.

* **No Lookahead:** I have verified that the features generated on historical data are **bit-for-bit identical** to the features the system generates in a live environment.  
* **Conservative T+1 Execution:** The backtest uses a pessimistic ""T+1"" fill model. This means the decision to trade is made at the close of one candle (T), but the trade is simulated as executing on the *next* candle (T+1). To account for slippage and market friction, all buys are filled at the **high** of that next candle, and all sells are filled at the **low**. This ensures the model's edge is strong enough to survive real-world execution conditions.

Here are the visuals for the test period:

Using this system, I'm able to train models that predict at all sorts of different timeframes.  This is one of my longer term models - it predicts the return for the next 24 hours every hour.  I am in the process of developing one of these models to post automated trade signals for BTC/USD in real time through my X account, this model is meant to operate at a frequency that a person following it on X could realistically keep up with.  When it's ready I'll write a new post showing recent backtesting details for the specific model it's running.  Until then I'm happy to answer questions.

1nqiyhg,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 17:19:03,I backtested a system with 50 wins and 0 losses (investing) — and I did it without using charts.,"I took all of the stock market data I could possibly find and found a system where I managed to hold companies from 50+ years ago that I would still hold. It’s got nothing to do with charts at all — it’s something in particular I look for, and I found a correlation between the successful ones and the ones that fail. Obviously, I didn’t crack the code, LOL.

But it could just be a dumb coincidence. However, I saw that I would need 1 win to cover 25–40 losses. I used the system and made a handsome return, not in money, but in percentage.

However, I feel skeptical. How do I know if the system I have is the system that’ll work in the future? I mean, unless it’s value investing, I see no other way to tell if the future is bright or not. I don’t want to just “dabble” for 40 years of my life. Any advice?

Even if I lose the next 20–30 times in a row, and one win comes out, who’s to say I’ll win 51 times? Maybe it’ll always stay at 50, and the losses will rack up.

1nqim2d,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 17:04:54,Crypto + Stocks in one place? Here’s my take on RUX,"One of the biggest pains in trading has always been switching between platforms. If you trade crypto and also dabble in stocks, you probably know the hassle: different apps, scattered funds, high spreads, KYC-heavy setups, and delays when you just want to get in and out of a position quickly.

I’ve been looking at how exchanges are trying to solve this, and RUX on Bitget caught my eye. It basically combines stocks and crypto under one roof, so instead of juggling broker accounts and crypto wallets, you can use USDT directly to trade things like NVDA, TSLA, or AAPL with leverage if you want.

It lowers the entry barrier too — instead of needing big capital, you can start with small amounts. And since it’s index-based, pricing feels more transparent compared to relying on a single source.

The idea of blending traditional assets with crypto tools (fast settlement, fractional trading, global access) could be a game-changer for traders who want flexibility without all the usual friction.

Curious what everyone here thinks — does RUX actually make trading easier, or is it just another shiny product trying to merge two worlds?",1,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nqim2d/crypto_stocks_in_one_place_heres_my_take_on_rux/,new,Stocks,1.0
1nqij5e,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 17:01:37,"What Losing $72,000 Taught Me About Trading","

I don’t post this to flex or to get sympathy. I’m posting this because every trader at some point hits a wall, and for me that wall cost $72,117. Looking back at those trades, I learned more from that drawdown than from any winning streak I’ve ever had. If you’re in this game, I hope what I share here saves you time, money, and a few blown accounts.

1. Risk management isn’t a suggestion
When I dug into those losses, the biggest mistake wasn’t the setups themselves. It was that I had no consistent risk plan. Sometimes I’d risk $200, sometimes $2,000, depending on how “confident” I felt. Confidence is not risk management. Without a fixed risk per trade, every loss compounds unpredictably. The number that stood out most to me wasn’t the -$72K. It was the 13 consecutive losses. With proper risk sizing, that stretch should have been frustrating, not account-ending.

2. Losing streaks reveal the truth about your process.
It’s easy to feel like a genius when trades are going your way. You start to believe the market “makes sense” and you’ve got it figured out. A real losing streak exposes whether you have an actual system or if you’re just winging it. During those 13 red trades in a row, I realized I didn’t have a defined playbook. I had “ideas” and “feelings”  but nothing I could consistently execute. If you can’t clearly write down your setup, your entry/exit criteria, and your risk rules, you don’t have a strategy. You have hope.

3. The psychological spiral is real.
After a string of red trades, my instinct was to “make it back.” That’s when I started oversizing, taking lower-quality setups, and ignoring my stops. Every losing trader knows this spiral, but very few actually put systems in place to stop it. What I should have done was step away after 3 losses, reset, and review. Instead, I traded through it and bled out. Discipline isn’t about avoiding emotions, it’s about building rules that protect you from yourself when those emotions hit.

4. Journaling turns pain into progress.
The $72K wasn’t wasted because I documented every single one of those trades. I tracked context, entries, exits, and what was going through my head. Patterns became obvious: I was most reckless after 10:30 AM, I entered early instead of waiting for confirmation, and I risked more after a loss. Without journaling, I would’ve walked away with nothing but regret. With it, I built the foundation of my current process.

Losing money doesn’t make you a bad trader. Refusing to learn from it does. If you’re new, don’t wait until you’re $72,000 down to respect risk, build a playbook, and journal your execution. If you’ve already taken big losses, don’t waste them  extract every lesson you can and let the data, not your emotions, shape your next chapter.",176,46,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nqij5e/what_losing_72000_taught_me_about_trading/,new,Due-diligence,0.94

Not the gurus you see, but real ones. They are out there but they are a different breed of person and they don’t have the capital constraints or feelings of money you possess.

If you are dealing with the psychological stresses of trading it’s because you are trading something you shouldn’t be doing.

Zoom out and scale out for the next 20 trades. Watch how your results magically improve.

You don’t have to worry about news, or gaps, or stop hunts, which you have all branded as liquidity sweeps, yet somehow deny that stop hunting isn’t real….. but anyways.

Most of you are better for swing trading or position trading.

You don’t get to join the NBA because you watched Jordan dunk. You don’t just get to succeed at the most highly leveraged variant of trading in the world simply because you think you need to lock in.

Your guru lied to you. 

Start with the basics. If you can’t make a profit in stocks you aren’t going to make a profit in any variation of a derivative of a stock.

All you will do is compound your losses. You should know. If you were honest and posted your last 90 days of trading you’d see the flaws.

And if you’re going to gamble with stocks, then there’s no hope for you at all. If you’re a gambler, stop trading and go back to the casino. Vegas is dying. ",17,21,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nqhtn9/you_are_losing_because_youre_forcing_something/,new,Discussion,0.68

1nqcf9f,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 13:07:18,10 Biggest Mistakes I Made My First Year (And How I Fixed Each One),"**An Autopsy of My First Year ( As requested by yall on my last post)**

My first year of trading was brutal. I thought I was going to get rich quick, but instead I stacked mistake after mistake. Looking back, that year and the 2nd was the most important part of my journey, because it forced me to learn the hard lessons that still guide me today and it helped me realize wehat syle and what markets fit me best!

Here are the 10 biggest mistakes I made and exactly how I fixed them:

1. Oversizing

I’d risk half my account on a single trade because I “knew” it was going to work. Of course, when it didn’t, I wiped out weeks of progress in seconds.

Fix: I committed to fixed risk per trade. Now I size everything in R multiples, win or lose, I know exactly what’s on the line. I styill have dynamic risk but its between 1-4% depending on the trade.

2. No stop losses

I used to believe I could “manage trades manually.” That always ended with me staring at a massive floating loss, hoping it would turn.

Fix: I set hard stops every trade. Even if it’s a painful stop out, it saves me from the catastrophic blowups. I sually tend to take reversals so I set my stop at the new high/low that was set.

3. Strategy hopping

Every week I’d be on YouTube chasing a new “holy grail” system. Supply and demand one week, moving averages the next, then order blocks, then RSI.

Fix: I picked one framework and committed to it for 6 months straight. Consistency of execution was more important than constantly chasing perfection. Backtested the hell out of it with a proper tool, nt just bar replay, then forward tested it.

4. Not journaling

I’d take 20 trades in a week and by Friday I couldn’t even remember half of them. There was no way to know if I was improving or just repeating mistakes.

Fix: I logged every trade, entry, stop, setup, and notes. Now I can look back and clearly see why a trade failed instead of guessing.

5. Trading when emotional

If I lost in the morning, I’d double size in the afternoon trying to make it back. If I was bored, I’d force trades just to “do something.”

Fix: I started tagging trades with emotions in my review. Over time, I noticed revenge trading patterns and cut them out. This was the hardest thing for me to beat. I would go on massive winning streaks but as soon as I had 2-3 lossed, I would go berzerk.

6. Chasing moves

I’d see a big candle rip and jump in late, only to get stopped out when price retraced. FOMO killed me more than bad setups or I would see my A+ setup playout for the day, then get pissed and chase some subpar trade.

Fix: I learned to mark levels ahead of time and wait for price to come to me. My best trades now feel “boring” because they’re planned hours in advance.

7. Ignoring time of day

I used to trade from open to close, thinking more screen time = more money. Instead, I just collected random losses.

Fix: By tracking trades by time, I saw most of my losses came between 8:30-10:30 PST. Now I avoid that window completely and focus on my profitable sessions.

8. No game plan

I’d wake up, open the chart, and hope something obvious would appear. Of course, that led to me forcing setups out of thin air.

Fix: I write a plan before every session with key levels, bullish/bearish scenarios, and triggers. If nothing lines up, I don’t trade and if I don't write a gameplan the day before or prte market, I also don't trade.

9. No weekly review

Every week bled into the next. I never connected the dots between what was working and what wasn’t. Half assing things DOES NOT work in dieting, training, trading or any aspect of life.

Fix: I do a weekend review where I group trades by setup, time, and outcome. That’s where the biggest breakthroughs come from, not daily PnL, but trends over time. I also spend time backtesting 1-2 week of data, every single week without missing a week for over 3 years now.

10. Expecting fast success

I thought I’d be consistent in 6 months. When it didn’t happen, I forced trades to “make up for lost time.” That mindset cost me more than any losing streak.

Fix: I accepted this is a 3-5 year or even longer game. Once I stopped rushing, I focused on the process instead of chasing quick wins. Do not put a time frame on this because that just adds more stress to you.

Trading will humble you. The key is letting those mistakes shape you instead of break you.

Trading has never been about luck, It comes down to knowledge, discipline, and strategy, Anyone can take a gamble, but the people who consistently improve are the ones who treat trading like a skill, They know when to stay patient, when to step in, and when to step out, That discipline is what separates someone who survives multiple cycles from someone who burns out.

The company announced early trial results for its experimental drug PGN-EDODM1, aimed at treating myotonic dystrophy type 1. That’s a genetic condition that weakens and stiffens muscles and can even impact the heart and lungs.

The drug works by correcting faulty RNA splicing, which could potentially reverse muscle weakness and stiffness in patients. If this continues to show promise, it could be a big step forward for this condition where there aren’t many effective treatments.

Curious what everyone thinks: is this just a short-term hype spike, or could PepGen actually become a longer-term play if the drug advances through further trials?

1nq3nh7,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 06:58:20,The real psychological fight,"Yall keep fighting for quick returns. 

It’s what keeping you from being successful.

The psychological warfare is not just from trading. But rather the type of trading you are all trying to achieve. 

The real fight is in accepting that if you want to succeed you first have to get yourself into something that is lightweight and gives you the opportunity to learn about all of the stock market.

It’s not that you don’t want to learn complex option strategies. You just don’t have the time because you spend it glued to charts and backtesting systems that inherently have no edge.

The 3-5 years isn’t about you “locking in” on some wild ass trading. 

It’s about actually learning and growing and developing the proper system in place to take advantage of edges in the market when they appear.

You don’t like me personally. You don’t need to. Honestly, I don’t like you either. So who gives a shit. 

I do something none of your gurus do. Post my entire record. All transparent. And yet, because my returns are 2-3% monthly, you’ll reject that.

Listen.

The Medallion fund is the most legendary fund ever. It was able to gross 60% returns annually for decades. They did so much, that they closed off the fund to new money so they could just internally scale their own capital.

That comes out to about 4% monthly on average compounded. My returns put me easily in the top 10% of traders in the world. 

You doubling an account isn’t a real thing. It’s just a stupid risk. 

You’ve all forgotten compounding returns. You would rather chase the dopamine instead.

Doubt me. Question me. Post your trading record as I have mine. Not just ROI. Not just winrate. Alpha. Beta. Sortino. Sharpe. Calmar.

Pound for pound on trading I absolutely will destroy you. 

If you aren’t able to show your last 90 day stats your opinion isn’t shit.

My education is free. There is no catch. The only catch is you and your limited belief system.

If not me, then go get a real education. Dive into old books. Before books just became lead magnets. They were once actual tools to share valuable information. You couldn’t just publish a book and distribute it because you wanted to.

You had to prove what you had to say was of value.

Post your 90 day stats. Let’s see what your downvotes are really worth.

Two Chinese tech giants are standing out right now: **Alibaba** and **Baidu**.

**Alibaba (BABA)** has had a rough stretch, losing more than 76% at its worst. But this year it’s up \~94%. Its AI push is serious — the Qwen language models, big bets on AI chips and cloud infrastructure — all of it signals Alibaba isn’t just an e-commerce player anymore. At \~18.7× trailing P/E, it’s not expensive given what it's doing. Many investors might be underestimating how much upside is left.

**Baidu (BIDU)** has also been dragging for years, but it’s stirring now—up \~48% over the past month. Its valuation is low (\~12.4× trailing P/E). And with its “Ernie X1.1” reasoning model debuting, it’s directly competing with big names like GPT-5 and Gemini. Baidu has tons of data, which is a huge edge in AI.

Of course, Chinese stocks are volatile, and short-term moves can sting. But for longer game players with some risk tolerance, dipping a toe into Alibaba or Baidu now might pay off if China’s AI evolution continues.

The reaction was... spirited. 😵 But the tape this week is screaming that this isn't a pessimistic take it's just the new structural reality. We've officially entered a two track market, and the AI rally just got a beautiful, violent reminder of this when the world's second biggest copper mine shut down and the physical metal went vertical. 

This is the new playbook: a barbell economy where the only things that seem to matter are the politically essential narratives on one side, and the physically-essential resources on the other.
​On one end of the barbell, you have the National Champs Nvidia isn't just investing $100B in OpenAI, it's funding a state sponsored Manhattan Project. 

Intel isn't just raising capital; it's passing the hat from Nvidia to Apple in a government blessed fundraising tour to create a domestic chip cartel. The value of these companies is now a function of political will as much as it is of earnings. 

On the other end, you have the physically scarce inputs this new industrial machine needs to run: copper, lithium, energy. Their value is a function of geology and physical logistics. The fascinating question is what this means for everything caught in the middle. 

Is this the new permanent structure of the market? And if so, is the only winning strategy to own both ends of the barbell and ignore everything else?

Let's brainstorm together

1. Minimize losses

You’ve probably heard that you should cut your losses, but the most important rule is to lose as little as possible. Keep your losses as small as you can.

Similar to a business, if you can keep your losses close to 0, it becomes “easy” to go from red to green.

2. Use a trailing stop

By using a trailing stop loss, you automate some of your risk and money management. The trailing stop also helps you achieve rule number 1, minimize losses!

3. Follow the trend

Trade with the trend, it is your friend. You’ve probably heard that as well, but it is true. Do not trade against the market, in the same way you shouldn’t swim against the flow of a river. Go with the flow, follow the trend. Find a good spot to enter and ride the wave.

4. Don’t try to time the market

If you could time the market, you’d be ultra rich. Instead of trying to time the market, follow your system, your rules and execute an entry or exit based on what your rules say.

5. Trade high probability setups

Wait for the high probability trade setups and only take those positions. Don’t gamble on noise, random setups. By taking high probability setups, it is much easier to turn a profit over time, while following the above rules of course.",12,9,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1npr28s/my_top_5_rules_that_improved_my_stock_trading/,new,Strategy,0.88

If you don’t remember, in 2020, VMware was accused of delaying sales order paperwork to push revenue into the next quarter, allegedly masking its true financial situation. When this came to light, $VMW stock dropped, and investors filed a lawsuit.

The good news is that $VMW settled $102.5M with investors and they’re accepting late claims. 

So here's all I know about this settlement:  

**Q. Who can claim this settlement?**

A. Anyone who purchased or otherwise acquired $VMW from August 24, 2018, to February 27, 2020.  

**Q. Do I need to sell/lose my shares to get this settlement?**

A. No, if you have purchased $VMW during the class period, you are eligible to participate.

**Q. How much money do I get per share?**

A. The estimated payout is $1.87 per share, but the final amount will depend on how many shareholders file claims.

**Q. How long does the payout process take?**

A. It typically takes 8 to 12 months after the claim deadline for payouts to be processed, depending on the court and settlement administration.

My approach was simple: watch the live trades they publish, mirror a small number of signals manually, and slowly scale exposure when comfortable. There were a few clear patterns:

* Short timeframe bots (like 1-15m) move fast and cost you in fees/slippage unless you're fully automated.
* Transparency matters – platforms that show trade histories and performance metrics are way easier to test.
* Even with a decent win rate, a handful of big losers will gut returns if risk management isn't solid

I didn't blindly copy everything – i cherry-picked trades/signals that made the most sense to me. I tried a couple of big names like trade ideas, trend spider, tickeron, and a few smaller platforms. Now i've ended up sticking with tickeron (it's not perfect and was a bit confusing at first, but their transparency and the ability to watch live trades/stats across hundreds of trading bots made the difference for me).

Following the trend helps you minimize unnecessary risks, avoid emotional mistakes, and capture bigger moves with less stress. The trend is your friend, so stay patient, disciplined, and let the market work in your favor.

I wrote random notes here and there, but never with consistency and definitely not in a way that made me a better trader.

I hand wrote evrything, highlighted and marked stuff, never had any data I needed accesable to me.



Now, journaling is my most important edge. This is exactly what my workflow looks like:



**What I log after every trade:**



Entry, exit, stop, and R multiple.



Setup type (was it A+, B, or just emotional?).



Time of day (NY open, lunch chop, etc.).



What I was feeling before/during/after.

**How I review each trade:**



I look at screenshots and ask: “Did price action confirm my idea, or did I force it?”



I tag trades by session and setup so I can see patterns in bulk. (Mistakes, Playbooks, Custom tags..)



https://preview.redd.it/3bvzk0e3k1rf1.png?width=361&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b4c8eb6a4f50dd5d2f85db89606a9288c1f9ade

I grade myself not just on win/loss but on execution. A “good loss” is still a win if I followed my process. That's how I always wrapo up my journal for the day, if I ened in green or red.

**How it’s helped me improve:**



I spotted that my worst trades always came between 8:30-10:30 PST and Asia session, so I just cut that window out.

https://preview.redd.it/9w5r7gbzj1rf1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=f842ca399160d51c15fc902c3caaa3d5ed583bb9

I learned I only needed 1-2 solid setups a day instead of chasing everything.



I built confidence, because I wasn’t trading based on vibes,  I had the data in front of me.





Journaling isn’t about writing more. It’s about writing the right things and reviewing them the right way. That’s where the growth happens.



What do you want to see next?



A) A full breakdown of my weekly review process.



B) A real trade example with my notes and what I learned.



C) How I use tags to find which setups actually make me money.

1np0zqv,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 22:46:09,coming to 3 years trading full time,"I am a swing trader. Holding a trade for few weeks. I trade stocks and futures.  
  
I had dabbled in trading part-time starting in 2015, but in 2021, something changed. I found the right path, and it became a total obsession. The next two years were about complete focus with thousands of hours glued to charts, internalizing my setups.  My trading is hugely influenced by Mark Minervini and his VCP pattern. That is still pretty much what I trade. 

I had been fortunate in my career (the Bay Area pays well) and had saved over a million dollars. When I decided to go full-time, I did it cautiously, allocating only 25% of my savings to trading capital.

My first full-time year, 2023, was a struggle for months. With my swing trading style, there are long periods where the market isn't giving me anything. Then, August came. I caught a monster trend and it felt like everything clicked into place. I ended the year up 100%.

The second year started strong, but then I did something profoundly stupid. I took on a tremendous amount of risk on a new instrument and it went sideways. It was my worst drawdown. That one mistake weighed heavy on me. For the most of the year, I was wrestling with self-doubt, failing to execute top setups. I ended the year up 8%, but I know that I'd thrown away at least a 30% year.

This year, I've done almost everything right. I've been disciplined and followed my process, and I'm up over 30%. But the mental struggle is constant. 

After just a few losses, I still wonder if I'll ever have a winning trade again.

This is a very hard profession. The way I trade, where I make the vast majority of my money in just a few weeks in an entire year, takes a huge mental toll. 

After a few string of losses, I still find it incredibly difficult to risk - 1-2% of my account - even on top setup. I hope I can get better at this.

The business of trading is simple.
Find trends, ride it till it ends.
Doesn’t matter what setup you use to enter, pick one, stick to that shit.
Cut losses the moment your idea is invalidated. 
Protect mental capital at all costs. Why would you sit around for days in the red. Just cut that shit and go on to live another day, stress free. You can always enter again.
Scale into winners, that’s how you make the big bucks. Gradual exposure to a winning trade, not by doubling down on a looser cuz you think it’s gonna bounce.

This business is always going to have an element of discretion and feel. Do what you can to add structure but learning to feel the market is not a science. It’s energy, it’s flow, it’s market sentiment. Add whatever technicals you want but you can’t pinpoint an abstract thing. BUT, you will fail without some kind of structure. So accept that paradox of the market. 

You will never know what is going to happen next. Do whatever analysis you want. Crunch all the numbers. Read all the news. But when you put on risk, expect that you will loose.

This shit takes time. It’s a skill. Clicking the button isn’t the skill, it’s everything behind the click. Any avg joe can make money once, but to make it consistently, through many market storms, is what makes someone a trader. When times are good, everyone makes money. But in the bad times, who keeps their winnings?

1nos48l,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 16:15:49,3 years of trading: The brutal lessons I wish someone told me sooner,"I’ve been trading seriously for about 3 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up small accounts, overleveraged, revenge-traded, and gone through the cycle of overconfidence → humility → back to square one. I’m not a guru, I’m not here to sell you anything. I just want to share the lessons that actually stuck with me, because I wish I had internalized these from day one.

1. Risk management isn’t optional it’s survival

Everyone says “risk management matters” but you don’t really understand it until you blow up a few accounts. The truth is, you can have a 40–50% win rate and still be profitable if your winners are bigger than your losers. But if you don’t cap your risk per trade (1–2% of account size), you’re basically playing Russian roulette. One stubborn “this has to bounce” moment can erase months of progress.

2. The market doesn’t reward effort it rewards discipline

I used to believe that the harder I studied, the more setups I should be able to find. Wrong. Most days, there’s nothing worth trading. Some of my best weeks came from taking only 3–4 trades total. Sitting on your hands feels lazy at first, but the reality is: trading more doesn’t equal earning more. It usually equals bleeding more.

3. Overcomplication is a trap

In my first year, my charts looked like a Christmas tree: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci levels, you name it. I thought the “secret” was hidden in some magical indicator combination. After testing for months, I came back to basics: clean levels, volume, and price action. Most pros I’ve observed keep it shockingly simple because clutter breeds hesitation, and hesitation costs money.

4. Journaling turned me from “random clicking” into an actual trader

I resisted journaling for the longest time. Felt tedious. But when I finally did it, patterns jumped out: I overtraded after losses, I closed winners too early when I was scared, I took dumb setups when I was bored. None of that was visible on my P&L alone. Writing down the why behind each trade gave me brutal but necessary feedback.

5. Trading will expose your psychology faster than anything else

The market is the best mirror you’ll ever have. If you’re impatient in life, you’ll overtrade. If you’re stubborn, you’ll refuse to cut losers. If you’re greedy, you’ll size up too soon. I used to think trading was about charts now I know it’s mostly about emotional control. If you don’t fix your mindset, no strategy will save you.

6. You don’t need to “quit your job” to be a trader

This one took me a while. I used to idolize the idea of being a “full-time trader” with no other income. The truth ? Having a second income stream actually helps you trade better, because you’re not desperate for every single trade to pay your bills. Desperation makes you reckless. A job or side hustle gives you breathing room, which translates into better decisions.

7. Consistency > jackpots

My biggest trap was thinking I needed one massive trade to “make it.” The truth is, trading is about grinding out small, consistent gains while keeping losses tiny. A steady +$100 a day is infinitely more powerful (and sustainable) than swinging for +$1,000 and wiping out half your account.",755,111,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nos48l/3_years_of_trading_the_brutal_lessons_i_wish/,new,Advice,0.97

Curve-fitting, lucky streaks, or unusual market conditions can all distort the picture.

We built a tool that does exactly this:

* ✅ Run thousands of equity-curve variations
* ✅ Measure probability of drawdowns
* ✅ Estimate realistic return/risk expectations

1nolq6z,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 12:15:31,Why I Stopped Using Single Indicators (Multi-Confirmation Strategy Results),"After losing Money following RSI divergences blindly, I rebuilt my entire approach around multiple indicator confirmation. Turns out most retail traders fail because they act on ONE signal.

**The Problem with Single Indicators:**

* RSI shows ""oversold"" → price keeps falling
* MACD crossover → turns out to be noise
* Breakout confirmed → immediately reverses

**The Multi-Confirmation Framework I Use Now:**

**Layer 1: Momentum**

* RSI (14) + Stochastic (14,3,3)
* Both must align—no single momentum signal

**Layer 2: Trend**

* EMA crossover (9/21) + ADX > 25
* Confirms directional strength, filters sideways chop

**Layer 3: Volume**

* Volume > 20-day average + Volume Rate of Change
* No breakouts without volume backing

**Layer 4: Support/Resistance**

* Price action at key levels + Bollinger Bands
* Entry only near logical S/R zones

**The Magic: 3 out of 4 layers must confirm before I enter.**

**Real Example (RELIANCE - Aug 2024):**

* RSI + Stochastic both oversold ✓
* EMA crossover + ADX rising ✓
* Volume spike on bounce ✓
* Bounce from 200-day MA ✓
* Result: 12% gain in 3 weeks vs. 2% loss following RSI alone

**Backtested Results (500+ trades):**

* Win rate: 62% vs. 38% with single indicators
* Average R:R improved from 1:1.2 to 1:1.8
* Max consecutive losses dropped from 9 to 4

**Key Learning:** Markets are noisy. Multiple confirmations filter out 80% of false signals, leaving you with higher-probability setups.

The patience to wait for 3-4 confirmations is what separates profitable traders from the 95% who chase every signal.

One of the most overlooked skills in forex trading isn’t predicting the market — it’s staying consistent. Many traders jump from one strategy to another, chasing quick profits, but this often leads to frustration and losses.

Consistency means:

Following your trading plan every day, without skipping steps.

Managing risk the same way on every trade, not letting emotions decide position size.

Reviewing and learning from trades regularly instead of guessing what went wrong.


Profits in forex don’t come from one lucky trade — they come from repeating a proven process over time. Even small, steady gains compound into long-term success when you stay disciplined.

In short: Master your plan, stick to it, and let consistency do the heavy lifting.",0,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nojuby/the_key_to_success_in_forex_consistency/,new,Discussion,0.5

# WAIT!

**This post is a critique, not an attack. Actionable insights are provided**

This doesn't come from a place of ignorance. I don't debate what I don't know. This post is in good faith.

Many people choose to dismiss ICT as a ""fraud"", but let’s look into it together.

 **""Smart Money Concepts"" \[1\]**

# The institutional story & why retail traders find it appealing

ICT, to most retail traders, is convincing; by design, it helps them feel reassured and in control; it subconsciously satisfies your psychological needs if you believe in the theory, which is desirable but not beneficial for most.

**This study shows that most humans are even willing to give up financial gain to feel in control.**

The value of control

Moritz Reis, Roland Pfister, Katharina A. Schwarz

I'm sure you can relate if you are a discretionary ICT trader or an ex-ICT trader; the **Ad-hoc reasoning** makes the trader feel like they know what’s happening in the market(s) they’re trading and why things have taken place, present and past. The **hindsight bias** is also brutal due to the excesssive number of entry methods provided.

**The need for control is innate in us; it's how we're wired as humans.**

The data snooping across multiple timeframes displayed by most discretionary ICT traders makes it conveniently harder to expose again, by design.

**ICT/SMC is convoluted and discretionary likely on purpose, making it difficult for people to refute. It often presents like a shared belief system, rather than a straight forward replicable framework.**

**The burden of proof** constantly gets shifted, and circular reasoning pops up. ICT is designed to feel underpinned by logic and complex, but it’s mostly a mixture of heuristics and untestable narratives.

# SMC theory goes against market fundamentals [2]

[MMXM](https://preview.redd.it/kn35ycivtwqf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=463f698e663f27bc13df5b312324e565dc85598c)

**ICT example of supposed ""Market Maker Behaviour""**

https://preview.redd.it/iu4w6gvwtwqf1.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cd2c95d0b0adc548350558e622feee45fad6482

**Realistic Market Maker Behaviour**

**Market makers rarely engineer large movements over several ticks because of inventory risk.**

**I have provided institutional-grade literature which explains this in-depth towards the end.**

Understand that i'm not saying “stop hunting” never happens; it’s just rare and misrepresented by trading gurus to an extreme point. An MM moving price by a point to “sweep” liquidity is not the same as an MM moving price by 10+ points to induce/sweep liquidity; it's far too risky for them to do that, with rare exceptions.  
Even a 10-point move on index futures is large for a market maker.

**Here is an example (Futures):**

Let's make the current price 20010.00 and the price in focus 20000.00. -10 handles.  
If a predictive HFT MM Algo anticipates they'll be 3000 contracts 10 handles / $10 away from the current price and the algo anticipates the market impact per handle to be 200, leaving a +1000 contract discrepancy if the price is met, they wouldn't commit the 2000 contracts to spike the price most of the time even though it's logical because the inventory risk accumulation or chance of adverse selection would be too high even if they spread it out.

**They could be stuck with -2000 contracts on the wrong side of the market and lose a lot of money; all it takes is for a different algorithm to match their flow to nullify their market impact completely.**

**Here's the nuance, though:** if the price was already trading at that point that's $10 away from the current price and their predictive model still supports the decision they could provide liquidity at 20000.00 but also influence the price to trigger the orders but only if close and highly probable. For example, if the price is at 20000.50, they could sell a couple of hundred to flush the final buyers to trigger the anticipated order flow.

**The point is it's extremely unlikely for Market makers to influence larger movements/spikes to tap into anticipated liquidity unless the level is extremely close to where price discovery is taking place already. So it's the other market participants trading towards that level; that's the true causation, not the MMs.**

Some ICT traders will win; an overwhelming majority will lose. Even if all PD Arrays were ""applied correctly"" & if everyone traded ICT the exact same way, they'd be market crowds that'd be faded and cause alpha decay if there was any edge to begin with.

Note: Alpha decay is when a strategy loses its edge from being well known and executed.

I'm sure small market crowds from ICT trading behaviour already exist and are occasionally arbitraged by algos due to margin/trade size used & retail popularity. Predictable crowd flow gets faded. It’s not a conspiracy; it’s an industry fact.

# I've seen ICT work for others, so it must work, right? [3]

**This is a survivorship bias classic.**

[Traders still have a chance to make money with losing strategies](https://preview.redd.it/0kh6l9d3uwqf1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=62aed3c72c6d66c05d2fa11ec21e5fa9910ae840)

**As you can see here traders can make money with unprofitable strategies not Break-even. unprofitable.**

Anecdotal examples ≠ viability. Anecdotes don't hold weight.

If blackjack is rigged against the player, how come some gamblers made millions in Vegas without card counting? Ex. Dana White

Because it's a numbers game, and it all averages out.

Most ICT traders are losing money just like most gamblers in Vegas. But the wins are what's displayed, not the guy who lost his house in 100 hands.

It's the same thing with trading poorly modelled ideas, like most discretionary applications of ICT.

A few outliers will always exist; anecdotes do not replace systematic evidence.

There are academic-grade papers showing even coin flips can have periods of profitability coincidentally.

[Much more variance in outcomes is shown with zero edge](https://preview.redd.it/o21y1mo8uwqf1.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=0513aa7bba6bbadff4ad2cd8673cde7d719a69e6)

Most ICT traders don't collect first-party data on rule-based strategies (executed mechanically or with discretion); this is their downfall.

Few are the exception.

# Analogy (going deeper) [3]

SMC is like a “science” that never gets a fair test. The post isn’t to provoke and upset it’s to educate it’s not opinion it’s based on facts and visual evidence.

**ICT deals with time series data (OHLC), so data science rules do apply, but ICT’s application of “his concepts” violates standard data analysis principles. Whilst still having the illusion of rigour**

Price discovers quotes; it doesn’t “deliver them”. You’re wasting your time with theory. Half of what ICT says about inefficiency is correct; unfortunately, the rest of it is noise.

E/EV is the average net return per trade ex 1:2 with a 50% winrate is 0.5R avg profit per trade. E.g. (-1+2-1+2)/4 = 0.5R avg gain

[ICT DISTILLATION TOWER \(Analogy\)](https://preview.redd.it/baekswfduwqf1.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=b711296a78dac92b4850cbbf61aa740a148e2a17)

Think of ICT like fractional distillation, but you have a range of temperatures where you can extract a substance instead of the specific temperature required. Only a loose guide. That’s similar to data snooping and the other data science flaws when applied.

The point is you might still get the substance you need from the distillation process but a lot of excess time and energy is wasted because you don’t apply the correct amount of heat, etc.

That’s how I feel about ICT concepts. Decent, unoriginal techniques, but there's a lot of noise during the application.

If you want to know how prices really work look at books and papers talking about **liquidity provision, price discovery** and **market auctions** for the truth.

# Definitions [4]:

Alpha Decay  
When a trading strategy loses its edge because too many people use it or the market adapts. Any advantage gets diluted or arbitraged away over time, especially when strategies are shared publicly.

Julien Penasse - Understanding alpha decay

Ad hoc reasoning is when someone makes up an explanation on the spot to justify or defend their belief or theory; typically, after the fact in an ICT context, it’s usually tied to hindsight bias.

Anecdotal Evidence

Personal stories or isolated examples. Common in retail (""I saw someone make $1M prop firm withdrawals using SMC!""), but not reliable proof of a strategy’s viability.

First-party Data

Data collected directly from a trader’s own trades. Backtests or forward tests; not taken from others' results or community anecdotes. As I’ve suggested, high-quality, first-party data is essential for knowing if a system actually has an edge. A Key marker for strategy substance.

Coin Flip Analogy  
Used in this to reveal that even completely random methods can appear profitable in the short term due to chance. Useful for exposing how randomness/noise can be mistaken for skill in financial markets.

Data Snooping (in trading)

Inconsistently looking at the same data (chart) multiple times over multiple timeframes and scenarios to justify a trade. Discretionary traders often do this to fish for “confluence” to validate their trading idea.

Burden of Proof

The responsibility to provide evidence for a claim. In trading especially, it should always fall on the person promoting a strategy, not the skeptic asking for proof it’s effective.

Hindsight Bias  
When a trader believes, after a trade’s outcome is known, that they would’ve known the result. Common in discretionary trading and journaling, where charts are reviewed after moves happen, making everything look obvious in retrospect, especially with ICT.

Survivorship Bias  
Focusing primarily on the positive events/wins while ignoring the majority of instances, which are negative. In trading, it's when people point to profitable traders using a method (typically baseless) without acknowledging how many used the same method and lost money.

Circular Reasoning  
The logical fallacy where the conclusion is included in the premise. In trading, a good example is saying a method works because it works, without solid evidence. Often shows up in unverified trading strategies. (no quality first-party data)

# Summary/TLDR Can ICT/SMC be salvaged and used?

Many of the ideas are weak, but VERY few take advantage of actual short-term market inefficiencies, so if you insist on using it, you must do high-quality first-party backtesting first, per setup, per instrument, which takes a lot of work. An overwhelming majority of ICT traders skip this; that's their downfall.

If you insist on using “ICT’s ideas”, which we don’t, just like anything, make sure you rigorously test it on every instrument you run individually without tweaks or curve fitting. Or you don’t know how effective it really is or if it has any edge at all. **Unfortunately, ICT shares the same structural weaknesses as many retail systems: heavy discretion in most applications, limited first-party testing and heightened potential exposure to alpha decay.**

[Real Backtesting Data Example](https://preview.redd.it/o57evfniuwqf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c2786e85d235e13de99e65115060c50c04c7f83)

If you're going to use ICT make purely mechanical trading strategies based on logic rather than narrative skip things like MMXM and focus on more basic setups like breakers, mitigation, fvg and so on and build from there. If you are going to do multiple timeframe analysis use the same timeframes in the same order, per setup for consistent execution priority and to prevent look-ahead bias.

1noh5ve,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 09:18:13,The harsh truths nobody tells you about trading,"Most people come into day trading with dreams of financial freedom, working from a laptop, and making thousands before lunch time. And i honestly don’t blame them.. that’s how it’s sold online. But the reality of day trading is a lot harsher than what you see here from /r/wallstreetbets screenshots. For those who are serious about this, i wanted to list some of the truths most people won’t tell you until you’ve already lost a ton of money. This is part of an ongoing education series on reddit, if you like write ups like these, follow my account for more.

1. Most people lose money (and keep losing).

It’s estimated that 80 to 90% of traders fail, and that stat is no joke. The market is a zero-sum game; your wins come from someone else’s losses, and when you’re new, you’re the one feeding the experienced players. No strategy, guru, or indicator will change the fact that you’re paying tuition to the market in the beginning.

The hard part isn’t just learning setups..  it’s surviving long enough to actually get good. And the majority never make it past that stage because they run out of money or burn out mentally before they develop any consistency.

2. It takes years, not months, to get consistent.

A lot of beginners think they’ll be profitable within 6 months if they just grind hard enough. The truth is it usually takes 2 to 3 years of daily effort before you can really call yourself consistent. That’s thousands of hours of screen time, journaling, reviewing trades, and slowly building emotional resilience.

If that sounds like too much, trading probably isn’t for you. This is more like learning a professional craft (surgery, law, engineering) than picking up a side hustle. If you treat it like a shortcut, you’ll blow up.

3. Trading is boring when done right.

The highlight reels on social media show explosive wins and big green days. What you don’t see is that consistent trading is painfully repetitive. You’re taking the same setups over and over, cutting losers quickly, and stacking small wins.

If you’re looking for excitement, you’ll force trades, gamble on hype stocks, and churn your account into dust. The truth is the boring traders are the ones still around after 5 years.

4. Your emotions are your biggest enemy.

Everyone thinks they’ll be calm and logical until they watch their P/L swing hundreds or thousands in seconds. Fear makes you sell winners too early, greed makes you hold losers too long, and ego makes you size up when you shouldn’t.

No book or strategy will fix this for you; you only learn by facing it. The sooner you realize trading is 80% psychology and 20% strategy, the sooner you’ll start working on the real skill set that matters.

5. You won’t get rich with a small account.

Turning $1k into $100k in a year makes for a great screenshot, but it’s not reality. A small account limits your options and magnifies your risk. Realistic growth is slow, and it compounds over time. If you’re starting with $1 to 2k, your first goal should be survival and skill-building, not quitting your job.

The harsh truth is trading for income requires a big enough account to absorb losses and still generate meaningful returns. You don’t have to start huge, but you do need realistic expectations about what’s possible.

**Bottom Line**

Day trading isn’t the glamorous, quick-money lifestyle most people think it is. It’s a grind, it’s boring when done right, and it takes years to develop the skills and mindset needed to survive. If you’re still reading this and it doesn’t scare you off, that’s a good sign... you might have the patience and discipline to actually stick it out. Follow me for my next post.

One instrument and one asset is t going to cut it. Simplicity is the first round of liquidity 

You need for them to be uncorrelated. 

Example MBT, MCL, MES, and MGC. 

Prop firms want you to fail. It’s how they keep making money. You actually know this. You don’t want to accept it. That’s the mentality they thrive on. Your irrational understanding of risk and your desire for continuous dopamine.

Perfect storm to bleed you dry.

Despite hedging to be a very viable means of trading, example going long term long on ES, you can take a short on MES. Two different trades, for one simple purpose. Effectively hedging to minimize losses. Banned by prop firms.

By trading multiple assets with a single micro each you’re keeping yourself in the game. 

Your stop. Way the fuck away from the noise. If your stop is anywhere near price action, you’re liquidity. Get out of your head that you want to intraday trade. That only makes sense if you’re hedging a larger portfolio. 

You have to swing trade. But with props you have to manage actively by getting out at the end of the day and getting back in. You lose that hour but the gaps wont matter anymore because you’re on a low risk.

But if you’re riding out the higher time frame, you can capture days of price movement. Each day if price improved your market bias, add another micro and move in your stop. That’s how you’ll get your convexity. Your initial risk is narrow but you can scale into winners. 

Rinse repeat. You won’t bust. You’ll always be in the game. The drawback is that it takes a couple months as you’re only going for 2-3 percent returns a month on average. That’s where the gamblers lose their mind. 

Part of the 3-5 year window to being a pro trader just isn’t on knowledge, but actually building up your account. Allow compounding nature to work in your favor. 

You can’t get there on high risk. 

Chart on the daily, trade on the 15 minute. Set and forget. Repeat the next trading day. Generally between four to six assets you’ll have an opportunity to trade to satisfy the requirements of the prop firm. And since you’re closing out positions daily, you won’t need to worry about consistency rules. Your big win isn’t in a single day, but in a series of trades over the duration of the macro trend.

1nogb0o,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 08:41:08,UPDATE: Silver price forecast for next years,"Congratulations Silverbugs, good news that we have been doing great for the past few years. Bad news being, Silver price is going parabolic, and I am seeing some worrying signs.

Attached is Silver ETF (SLV) monthly chart; for your information, SLV per share is slightly cheaper than spot per ounce (about $3 less), please do your addition when converting to spot.

The price movement of SLV, starts to show some stunning similarities to 2011 peak. In 2011 frenzy, silver broke out the rising channel (dotted line), then fell back hard for the next 5-10 years. This is 2025, another similar rising channel also formed, and we're rapidly approaching the breakout point AGAIN.

Is 2026 going to be a replay of 2011? well, it depends on the trading volume. At 2011's blow-off top, volume surged to crazy levels; we have NOT seen it yet. However by looking into the chart, I am worried it's gonna be a deja vu.

Can anyone explain me what will be my liquidation price of this position? How far S&P can dump to liquidate my long position (in %)? When margin call is waking up, after 50% or 80%?

Recently I noticed exchanges experimenting with stock like trading, with  Bitget introducing something called RWA Futures, where you can trade assets directly with USDT, Out of curiosity, I tried it out with just $5 and some leverage,  mainly to see how it works in practice, Everything went fine, but the fact that it runs 24/7 feels strange compared to traditional markets that open and close at set times.

It works as expected, but I’m not sure if this kind of setup really has long term value or if it’s just another feature that only appeals to a small group of traders

I’m curious what others here think, does trading tokenized versions of stocks with stablecoins make sense, or does it add unnecessary risks?

It took me a 5000 dollar course to realize 5 years ago, that the market INDUCES you to take position, then gives you a few pips to boost your ego and confidence, only to then reverse against you REALLY hard, not giving you a chance to pull out. This is one of the many reasons why risk management is CRUCIAL.

Whether you're using ICT, Elliot Waves, EMAs, Stochastic, or Bollinger bands or WHATEVER method, the market will trigger your setup and excite you to enter only to screw you. If they're showing you a Bollinger buy entry, they're showing someone else an Elliot Wave sell entry. Then the market triggers your stops on BOTH sides before ultimately going in whichever direction it wants to go.

MOST of you who have not turned a profit in 5+ years, need to give up. You NEVER will. It's the sad reality. Accept it. I have met people on forums who have lost their entire retirements and bankrupted their businesses over this. Don't be that guy...


Not all of us are made for this. I'm not saying I'm better than you, I swear. I'm just saying, if THIS message has reached you, don't let yourself be one of the millions of people who get butchered in the market daily. You're not ""trading"" against other people. You're trading against algorithms, banks, governments, and Illuminati type organizations that thrive on analy drilling you without lube. (Sarcasm.) 


Stop falling for grifters and glorified course sellers with their bald heads, cigars, lamborghinis, buggatis, etc. ANYONE who is selling you a course, is not making a single penny off of trading. Why do I know this? Because i spent more than 20000 dollars on courses before I realized that EVERYTHING had always been right in front of me for free. Psychology. Risk Management. 50 percent accuracy, to let my winners run, and not pull out immediately in blues. To kill my failed trades and cut my relationship with them, instead of thinking ""oh god I just need to make that loss back.""

You gamble.

You lose.

Any viable strategy needed to survive the markets is entirely negated by the way you engage prop firms.

You just don’t really need to trade everyday on the same asset with the same instrument. And you shouldn’t. 

You trade MES to hedge the delta against your portfolio when the market takes a sharp turn. Or perhaps to amplify delta if it’s lagging and the market is moving stronger than your bias.

In that one process you’re not trading everyday. You’re trading when needed and for some, it may be a perpetual hold to manage the granularity of their portfolio.

Y’all overleveraged on account sizes as well. Nobody should be trading NQ or any mini. You just don’t have the account size for it.

Most of you could probably survive a lot longer if you just traded one micro. Instead you’re just busting out accounts left and right. That’s not the type of trading any firm wants.

They let you gamble high risks and you do.

If there was a prop firm that only let you trade a single micro for every $50k they would not get any business. Despite that being the way to trade. 

Part of the 3-5 year journey isn’t just in the learning how to trade. It’s in building up your account and allowing compounding earnings generate massive results.

But no. That’s too far away. Trading has turned into just a casino. 

I’ll follow up in the next post on what you should do to pass these prop firms to get funded and to stay funded.

I have a simple strategy I came up with that is a rendition of Tori Trade's strategy. If you aren't familiar, she draws trend lines top down and then sees which way it breaks. I'm basically doing that, but adding simple price action layers on top like noticing support and resistance as well. I also trade the 5 minute and jump down to the 1 minute to look for a couple candlestick patterns. I only have the engulfing and marubozu patterns ""learned"" (recognizable). Again, I am just starting so just keeping it super simple with price action, plus the 1 minute chart doesn't really hold a lot of weight with candlestick patterns I feel like, especially because almost every candle is probably a pattern at that time frame. So really I am just taking the trade even if I do not recognize an entry candle pattern when it closes past a trend line.

It may not be the best strategy in the world, but I feel like I am learning. I got an interest in trading about a week and a half ago or so, and I have been consuming a bunch of content until I stumbled upon Tori and it just clicked for me.

Anyways, just looking to see if there is anything else I should add to my trade logs. I wanna actually try to learn this. So, if there are any additional things I should be journaling, please let me know, and remember I just want to keep it simple.

Edit: and I just started, so don't be too rough. The trade values take a jump, because I discovered prop firms. I decided once I get comfortable to the point of using real money, in several months, I would much rather spend $200 to try my shot at getting access to a 50k account. Even though there are strict rules. So, I reset my account as well to adjust for practicing for that. I am still taking it as serious as possible though.

Good morning fellow devotees of the Bloomberg Terminal. 

Today, it would appear that the market isn’t just a market... but a geopolitical fanfic where NVIDIA drops $100 billion! yes, a number usually reserved for small wars or large moons into OpenAI to build an AI infrastructure so vast it’s basically a digital Vatican for the machine god. (It's nice to see them spending their war chest of late isn't it?)

IMHO this isn’t investing; it’s a corporate power grab that could fund clean water for the planet (or my latest online horse betting venture) but instead screams, We’ll out-compute the world! 

The market, ever the enabler, sent NVIDIA’s stock to the moon, because nothing says bullish like betting on a friendly Skynet. Meanwhile, Oracle’s been tapped as TikTok’s algorithm babysitter, a move so drenched in Langley vibes it might as well come with a trench coat and sunglasses. And let’s not overlook the Fed’s newest governor, Stephen Miran, openly stumping for rate cuts like he’s auditioning for a cabinet post, while gold and the S&P 500 hold hands at all-time highs like they’re in a buddy cop movie. 

This isn’t trading at all like we have been saying for the last few weeks, it’s conscription into a centrally planned bull market where every ticker salutes the flag. Long gold miners (GDX) for the chaos hedge, Oracle (ORCL) for its new role as national security mascot, or fade that Baby Shark IPO for the lolz....pick your side in this glorious mess, because we’re all industrial policy quants now. Thoughts?

Oh, and the scorecard for those hating of late. my long Intel call from last week is printing like a laser thanks to that rival bailout, the SMH/KWEB pairs trade is still a geopolitical cash machine, and the leveraged steepener’s biding its time for the yield curve to wake up.(the recent move has helped)

For the YOLO crowd, shorting Baby Shark post pop or buying Argentine bonds on the Treasury’s “we got you” vibe could be quick wins.

Traditional indicators work great... until they don't. RSI, MACD, moving averages—they all lag because they're reactive. By the time your charts show a bear market has started, you've already lost 15-20%.

The real game-changer? **Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for regime detection.** These AI models don't just analyze price—they identify the *underlying market state* in real-time.

Here's what I've learned:

* Markets aren't random—they follow distinct ""regimes"" (bull, bear, sideways)
* Each regime has different volatility patterns and price behaviors
* HMM can detect regime shifts 2-3 weeks before traditional indicators
* Combining this with sentiment analysis from news/social data = powerful edge

Example: In March 2020, HMM models flagged the regime change to ""high volatility bear"" 12 days before most technical indicators caught up. That's the difference between protecting capital and watching it evaporate.

Been backtesting strategies that adapt based on detected regimes rather than fixed rules. The results are eye-opening—14% higher win rates and 18% lower max drawdown compared to static approaches.

I’ve just started forex trading and I’m currently in my second week on a demo account. So far, what I feel is that trading is 90% psychology/instincts and only about 10% technicals (charts, indicators, etc.).

A trader I know told me a simple rule: “always buy when it’s a buyer’s market and always sell when it’s a seller’s market” – and surprisingly, that approach has been working for me.

Here’s how I trade right now:

I always use TP, but I don’t place a SL (and so far it has worked for me).

I treat this demo as if it’s real money – I take the same pressure I would on a live account.

Even though the demo balance is $3k, I consider it more like $100–200 in my mind to keep myself grounded.

After two weeks, my success rate is around 97%.

I know this is still very early and demo trading isn’t the same as real trading, but I’d love to hear from you guys:

1nnisop,2025-09-22,2025-09-22 06:27:07,Got the best teachings by market,"So I am a newbie trader in crypto, and for some reason I like crypto being volatile and also hate it at the same but I am a scalper who seeks quick move for like 0.1-0.25% price change in BTC/ETH/SOL.... I only traded in these because I didn't want to get liquidated by a huge volatility in market out of nowhere. My capital was 80$.... A pretty small one you could say. In the first few days I traded I made some profit and losses but overall my capital reached 130$.... I was happy with it and was planning how I would have 500$ by the end if this month and in process like this I would probably be having 7-8k before the end if this year.... Unfortunately dreams are just dreams, I was using 100% of my capital and with a 10x leverage so I could make like 10-15% a day. But I didn't put stop loss at all because I thought why I need I am playing in choppy market and so I didn't put it up and I accidentally fall asleep one night when my trade was active and by the morning I woke up, instead of feeling the bitter taste of coffee..... I felt the bitter taste of sleeping so peacefully.... I lost about 70 dollars in just one trade from then on I thought I would close my trade whenever the price rich 20% of my capital in loss and I followed it for a couple of times and was in a loss and profit face but I was seeing that the price bounces back just after I take exit in loss, it's like market was just after me..... Sigh I am still thinking like that. Anyways it led me to believe I should remove it since price bounces back so I didn't put it up and this led to  a trade on 40% loss but since it was a weekend and crypto goes down so I did hold it for the weekend and just today the trade and crypto market suddenly dropped so much and I completely got liquidated, at the end of time I closed my 50% trade thinking I saved some capital but forgot that the trade was on cross mode and not in isolated so I lost completely because the sharp drop today was something I haven't seen since I started trading..... I have made some huge mistakes but they were worth it to make me learn something, I always thought lossing money just feels like heartache but it also feels like a teaching fees..... Now I am thinking that I should paper trade for a week, my strategy is that I should only invest 10% of my capital and risk it entirely either I am gonna win 10% more or loss that for the day and stop trading that day so I am only loosing 10% a day and my strategy will work but only in a choppy market I should avoid during high volume hours and should just stick with scalping and not just get liquidated my Entire capital.... If anyone has a better advice please I am open to all suggestions as long as that can make me a better trader.....",3,12,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nnisop/got_the_best_teachings_by_market/,new,Discussion,1.0

Here are the main things I’ve learned about building strategies that actually survive:

1. **Start with real market logic** – momentum, mean reversion, trend trading. Don’t base it on random indicators or patterns without context. If there’s no logic behind why it should work, it won’t last.
2. **Define rules with zero subjectivity** – if you can’t code it into exact conditions, it’s not a real strategy. No “the market looks bullish.” Only measurable, rule-based setups.
3. **Backtest properly** – 10+ years of data across multiple pairs and environments. Short tests are misleading.
4. **Out-of-sample testing** – use untouched data to confirm the edge isn’t just curve-fitting.
5. **Robustness checks** – Monte Carlo simulations, parameter sensitivity, etc. If small changes destroy the results, it’s not stable.
6. **Forward test on demo** – confirm the system behaves in real markets before going live.

When a strategy goes through this process, it’s far more likely to stay profitable instead of collapsing after a few months.",4,12,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nnhg37/how_i_build_trading_strategies_that_remain/,new,Discussion,0.83

I’ve been running a rule-based commodity trading system (inspired by Turtle principles + my own execution rules), focused mainly on **Gold and Silver**. I track results rigorously using a *dynamic benchmark* — meaning I only count outperformance if my portfolio beats the **strongest benchmark (Nifty / Gold / Silver)** for that month. That way I measure true alpha, not just lucky comparisons.

Here’s the summary so far:

**Since Inception (Jul–Sep 2025)**

* **Portfolio PnL**: +62.78%
* **Best Benchmark (Silver, Jul–Sep)**: +22.15%
* **Outperformance vs Best Benchmark**: +40.63%

**Monthly Breakdown**

* **Jul ’25** → +10.84% (vs best benchmark +3.46%) → **+7.38% true alpha**
* **Aug ’25** → +15.39% (vs best benchmark +9.46%) → **+5.93% true alpha**
* **Sep ’25** → +36.56% (vs best benchmark +7.86%) → **+28.70% true alpha**

I’m documenting everything and open to sharing trade-level data for verification. My intention is clear: I’m not waiting for capital to come to me later — I want to be ready to present to people or desks who are willing to invest in a **proven system** now.

If anyone here has insights on **prop trading opportunities in India** or is connected with desks looking for systematic traders, I’d be glad to connect and share more details.",1,0,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nnhawn/looking_to_connect_with_prop_desks_in_india/,new,Prop firms,1.0

I have two versions of it (one for uptrends and one for downtrends), which are essentially the opposite of each other. I have a checklist that involves going through the weekly to 4-hourly timeframes, utilizing RSI, SMAs, MACD, and support/resistance areas. I have it written in third person as that helps make the rules clearer for me and stops me from reasoning as to when one can be slightly broken. I have also been testing it across the 7 main USD pairs to increase the likelihood of my setup appearing.

I'll paste it below, but just wanted some advice from those more experienced than me. cheers.

this is for the downtrend strategy:

**1.       Weekly**

·       On the weekly chart, confirm price is below the 50-SMA and 200-SMA, with 50-SMA below 200-SMA.

·       RSI < 50 to confirm bearish momentum.

 **2.       Daily Trend**

·       Ensure price remains below both 50-SMA and 200-SMA, with 50-SMA below 200-SMA (death cross).

·       Check that RSI < 50 and MACD line is below the signal line (bearish confirmation).

 **3.       Daily Rally**

·       On the daily chart, look for a temporary bounce toward the 50-SMA.

·       Ensure RSI rises to 50-60 (not overbought >70).

**4.       4-hour**

·       Look for price rejecting off the 50-SMA with a bearish candlestick and a MACD bearish crossover (MACD line crosses below signal line).

·       Ensure RSI is in the 50-60 range to avoid oversold entry.

·       Place SL above the recent swing high.

·       Set TP at the next support level or min. 2x SL distance for a 1:2 risk-reward ratio (if no clear support level).",1,3,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nnbcpq/dealing_with_no_setups/,new,Question,1.0

1nmx0to,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 12:50:01,5 Years In: The Advice I Wish Someone Gave Me On Day One,"I’ve been trading full-time for  2 years, started trading 5 years ago. Along the way, I’ve blown accounts, passed and lost prop firm challenges, had incredible months, and then been humbled the very next week. I primarily trade futures and stocks, but these lessons apply no matter what market you’re in.



1) Fewer Trades, Better Trades

My worst periods came from feeling like I needed to be in the market constantly. The reality is that most price action is just noise, or at least noise to YOU. The edge shows up only a handful of times each week. My best months came from taking fewer than 20 trades and letting the rest pass.



2) Keep Your Playbook Simple

When I started, my charts looked like Times Square, indicators stacked everywhere. That only led to hesitation and confusion. What finally worked was cutting it all down to a short, boring playbook: clean levels, liquidity cues, structure, and a couple of repeatable entries. Same markets, same times, same setups. Very very boring, which is good in the markets.



3) Risk First, Always

Every account I destroyed had the same cause: I ignored risk and moved stops, oversized or tried to “let it work.” Now I define my maximum loss per trade and per day. I place my stop where the trade is invalid and respect it. Capital is ammunition, you only get so much. Don’t waste it trying to prove you’re right. Also one of the reasons I could not make it in options trading is because yyou just never know the exact amount you can make.



4) Journaling Is Where Growth Happens

I used to think bad days were random. Journaling proved otherwise. When I started logging my trades with context, entry, exit, and emotions, patterns became obvious. I was revenge trading after losses, taking boredom trades late in the morning, and cutting winners during news. Writing it down forced me to face the truth and improve. I started with manual journaling but then moved to software years later because when you just write down stuff in your notebook, its really hard for the stats or the lessons you need to see to be availble to you quickly.



5) Protect Your Headspace

Trading money you can’t afford to lose is a fast way to ruin both your account and your mental health. If your rent or grocery money is on the line, you will cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and chase bad setups. Trade small, separate trading capital from living expenses, and make sure red days don’t control your mood for 24 hours.



6) Screen Time Beats Guru Time

Videos and books can teach you the basics, but real progress comes from watching price move in real time, replaying sessions, and backtesting your setups. Intuition isn’t luck, it’s thousands of hours of screen time.



7) Base Hits Beat Home Runs

Chasing the one big trade is what ruined me early on. Consistency is what built my account. A steady $200-300 a day compounds into far more than swinging for $5K and blowing up when you’re wrong. The small, repeatable wins are what keep you in the game long enough to scale. I started with making $20-40 a day or a trade I should say, and slowly sizing up, then gaining more capital and copy tading these smaller trades accross plenty accounts.



Bottom Line

Trading isn’t about finding a secret strategy. It’s about building a clear playbook, respecting risk, journaling your execution, and protecting your mindset. Once you do those things consistently, confidence stops being a feeling and becomes a fact backed by your data.



I’d like to continue doing write-ups like this if it helps the community. For my next post, I can go deeper into:



A) My exact journaling and review workflow (what I log, how I review, and how it’s helped me improve)

B) An autopsy of my first year, the 10 biggest mistakes I made and how I fixed each one

A few that stand out to me:

* **Sticking to risk limits** no matter what. It sounds basic, but it’s often the difference between blowing up and surviving long enough to grow.
* **Journaling trades** \- not just P/L, but documenting the *why* behind each entry and exit.
* **Routine** \- treating trading like a job, not a gamble. Having set hours, prepping before the session, and reviewing after.
* **Patience** \- waiting for high-quality setups instead of forcing trades.
* **Emotional control** \- being okay with losses, and not letting wins make you reckless.

From what I’ve seen, these habits tend to separate the traders who last from those who burn out quickly.

1nmsmso,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 09:56:16,Integrate day trade with job hunt? Looking for peers and advice,"**Purpose of this post**

I’m writing this post to have your view on my rationale and progress for day trading. I’m also looking for those who have a sustainable passion for day-trading, and ideally we can discuss strategies, share results, and even land a friendship. 

**Background**

* I’m a final-year student studying Finance and Machine Learning. My career interests are in asset management and markets, and I spend time every day reading news surrounding US commodity and equity markets. 
* Earlier this year, I finished my risk management internship at Macquarie (Australia’s well-known IB), but I didn’t receive a grad offer. Since then, I’ve been applying to pretty much every internship I can find related to asset management and markets. I managed to land a few interviews at Citi, GS, NAB, etc., but unfortunately didn’t get any offers.

I’m grateful that I managed to land a few interviews at prestigious firms, given Australia’s extremely saturated labor market. To give you an idea: NAB told us during the assessment centre that there were around 5,000 applications for their market internship role, and last year only 4 offers were given (you’d be surprised to find candidates at final stages that do not have 2+ internship experiences and equivalent to perfect GPA etc). Most mainstream internship applications are closed now, so I’ve started shifting my strategy to cold-emailing people on LinkedIn to see if there are any open spots.

**Rationale for Day Trading**

I have to say, the process of grinding through hundreds of online assessments, AI interviews, and waiting endlessly for outcomes is unhealthy. A few past colleagues and friends I catched up with agreed that it’s a fantasy to simply say and shift your mindset away when you’ve already invested hours or days into an application. The general consensus is that you find something intellectually challenging, so you’re not stuck worrying about things you can’t control. Some of my friends picked up swing trading or got serious about tennis, but for me, I wanted to know more about day trading.

**Why do I find myself suitable?**

* With application rounds near end and a reasonable coursework, I can consistently and currently put 3 hours purely for day-trading.
* I do not expect to put any capital until SIM proves consistent profits so there'd be no material losses on top of job rejections. My objective is to learn day trade as it's always been a huge interest for me.
* Although day-trading does not greatly depend on analyzing markets and company fundamentals, learning day trade provides great opportunity to learn the fundamental structure of a market and how orders, liquidity, volatility plays a role in influencing price actions. This is something that is intellectually challenging and aligns with my career interest.
* I personally don't think majors itself play a strong edge for day-trading but I've learnt to be patient, resilient and adaptive from my studies. At least I can claim that my majors have no negative impact for day trading.
* Yes I live in Sydney so market opens at 11:30 pm my time but I've managed to find a schedule that suits my life style.

**Current Progress**

I appreciate anyone who’s made it this far. The first thing I did when I started learning day trading was read *How to Day Trade for a Living* by Andrew Aziz, which really confirmed for me that consistency + passion > long hours + money-driven. Now I’m halfway through his second book, *Advanced Techniques for Day Trading*, and completed their lessons on psychology. I enjoy their live day trading sessions too, where you actually get to see how professional day traders (yes even Andrew himself) operate in real time and how they deal with psychological challenges in line with what’s written in their books, e.g., accepting losses like a chad.

I’ve also started using SIM on TradingView to get a feel for trade executions, and I’ve been journaling my trades and reflecting on them (attached a pic for reference). Right now, I’m committed to sticking with ONE or TWO strategies that I feel are most aligned with market logic and price action. I don’t really buy into fancy chart patterns (e.g. three white soldiers) that don’t have a solid root in market theory or psychology behavior but feel free to prove me wrong.

I’ve also attached a screenshot that shows my trade goals, how I define my trade book, and the rules I’m working with. They’re definitely still under progress, but feel free to take a look and drop any comments.

**Just one last bit**

Hopefully there’ll be some comments. I’ve purposely avoided going into too much detail to not bog people down. Instead, I’ll put more focus into building conversations with (all) comments and thus share more if necessary. If you'd just like to know more about me, just drop a comment and I’ll shoot you my LinkedIn pfp.

1nmquzi,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 08:38:11,The Future of Trading,"I believe we are in the midst of a significant paradigm shift in trading. I have been looking at more advanced trading strategies and I began researching Jim Simons.  He is one, if not the, most successful traders of all time.  He was years ahead of his time.  He trained scientists to trade and didn’t hire people from the financial community.  Same with Richard Dennis and Turtle traders. The point is, Simons hired the most brilliant minds in the world from meteorology to Applied Discrete Mathematics. Here is a summary of his work I asked AI to write. 

Jim Simons ran Renaissance’s Medallion as a data-driven, market-neutral, short-term statistical-arbitrage machine: clean huge datasets, find many tiny repeatable patterns with math and ML, trade across thousands of instruments, combine hundreds of small signals, hedge out broad market risk, size positions by expected edge and how they move together, cut losing signals fast, and crush costs and slippage with world-class execution. In that setup, trading—signal aggregation, portfolio construction, execution quality, and risk/cost control—mattered far more than classic stock selection; the specific names were mostly “carriers” for micro-patterns, while profits came from many small, fast, well-hedged bets executed with precision. 

He returned 66% annualized return over his career.  I began to reason we have access to this knowledge at our finger tips now with AI. Trading will change, whether we change with it or not.  If you consider we are on the front end, finally with traction in crypto, AI, quantum, the resurgence of nuclear, Robotics, etc., the future market looks like the beginning of a bull run which could run ahead of tech development and implementation. I think we are going to have to adjust and develop new metrics.  Jobs will be lost on the front end as jobs are developed to service and manage data centers, EV robotaxis, drones, nuclear facilities and more.  My point to all of this is, algos and HFT’s are already here.  Retail traders must find an edge.  This lies in not just learning the smoke and mirrors ICT program but, how to trade along side the institutions and compete.  Start thinking outside the box.  Constructive Thoughts?

You can consistently do the wrong thing every single day. That doesn’t make it profitable, it just makes you consistent.

The truth is if your system doesn’t have an edge, then all the discipline in the world won’t save you. Discipline only amplifies what’s already there. If you’ve got a negative expectancy, discipline just makes you bleed out slower and more reliably.

I see a lot of traders saying they just need to “lock in” or “be more consistent” and that’s why they’re losing. No. Most of the time the reason they’re losing is because the way they trade has no edge in the first place. You can be a consistent loser. In fact, most traders are.

1nm2lej,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 12:25:25,Here's a realistic breakdown of what it actually takes to become a consistent trader,"Ive noticed most people get into day trading because they see screenshots of $5k, $10k, $50k days and think it’s a quick path to freedom. I’ll be straight with you guys, that’s the marketing version of trading. Please don't buy into it. The reality is much less glamorous, and if you don’t know what it really takes, you’re going to burn out fast. After 5 years in this game, i wanted to do a little write up on my honest breakdown of what consistency actually looks like. This is Part 3 of my education series here, follow if you want more.

1. Time commitment is way more than you expect.

Trading isn’t just 9:30am to 4pm. Real consistency comes from hours outside market time: premarket prep, journaling, reviewing trades, building watchlists, studying setups, and putting in screen time. Early on, I easily spent 40 to 60 hours a week between live trading and studying. If you treat this like a hobby, you’ll get hobby-level results.

And it’s not just the hours, it’s the years. Consistency doesn’t come in 6 months, or even a year for most people. You’re rewiring how you think about money, risk, and decision-making under pressure. Expect it to take 2 or 3 years of real effort before you’re truly stable.

2. Risk management is non-negotiable.

I know everyone hears this, but most beginners still ignore it. Consistency doesn’t mean you never lose... it means your losses are small and controlled while your winners are slightly bigger. That balance, over hundreds of trades, is what keeps you profitable.

I don’t care if you’ve got the best setup in the world; if you’re risking half your account on one trade, you’re gambling. True consistency comes from risking small, living to fight another day, and never letting one trade or one day define you.

3. Discipline beats strategy.

Every new trader is obsessed with finding the “perfect” strategy. They’ll cycle through indicators, patterns, and systems, convinced the answer is out there somewhere. The truth? Most basic strategies work if you follow them with discipline. Most traders fail not because of their system, but because they don’t stick to it.

Consistency is boring. It’s showing up, following the same rules, and resisting the urge to deviate because of greed or fear. If you can’t execute a simple plan consistently, no “advanced” strategy will save you.

4. You need emotional resilience.

Day trading will mess with your head. You’re going to lose money. You’re going to question if you’re cut out for this. You’re going to watch your P/L swing in seconds and feel emotions you didn’t know you had. The people who survive aren’t the ones who avoid that... they’re the ones who learn to handle it.

Emotional resilience means not tying your identity to your results. It means accepting red days without revenge trading. It means staying calm when you’re up big and not blowing it all chasing more. Without that mental toughness, you’ll self-destruct.

5. You have to treat it like a business.

This isn’t a game. If you’re serious about consistency, you have to approach trading like running a business. That means budgeting your capital, keeping records, analyzing performance, and making adjustments based on data, not emotion. Your journal is your balance sheet. Your setups are your products. Your time and focus are your resources.

When you treat trading like a hobby, it costs you money. When you treat it like a business, it gives you structure and accountability. That shift in mindset is often the difference between gamblers and professionals.

**Bottom line**

Becoming a consistent trader isn’t flashy. It’s not about one big win, a secret indicator, or a magic system. It’s about boring, repetitive, disciplined work.. day after day, year after year. If you accept that reality, you’ll stop chasing shortcuts and actually give yourself a chance to make it.

In that time, I’ve blown up accounts, had winning streaks, and gone through phases where I thought I finally “figured it out” only to get humbled the next week. If you’re just getting into this, I’ll save you a lot of pain by sharing the biggest lessons I wish someone drilled into me early on.

1. Risk management is everything.

This is the hill most beginners die on. It doesn’t matter how good your strategy looks, how many indicators you stack on your chart, or how many “conviction trades” you think you’ve found... if you don’t have strict risk rules, the market will clean you out. Always know your max risk per trade. For most people, that’s around 1–2% of your account balance. It sounds boring, but it’s the only thing that keeps you alive long enough to actually learn.

The temptation to “average down” or hold losers is massive when you’re new. You’ll convince yourself that a stock “has to bounce” or “can’t go any lower,” and then watch it tank another 10%. Every trader who’s lasted has their scars from ignoring stop losses. Treat capital like ammo; you only get so much of it, and wasting it on stubbornness will take you out of the game fast.

2. Don’t overtrade.

One of the biggest mistakes I see (and made myself) is thinking you need to be in a trade all the time. The reality is most of the market is just noise. The edge comes from waiting for the handful of clean setups each week that actually make sense. Some of my best months have come from taking fewer than 20 trades total.

It feels counterintuitive at first. You think, “If I’m not in a trade, I’m not making money.” But that’s backwards. By forcing trades, you’re just paying commissions, racking up losses, and burning mental energy. A huge skill in day trading is learning to sit on your hands until your setup appears. That patience is where consistency comes from.

3. Journaling changes the game.

I used to think journaling was pointless. Then I realized most of my losing trades weren’t about the strategy at all; they were about me. When you actually write down why you entered, why you exited, and what you were feeling at the time, patterns start to appear. You might notice you revenge trade after a loss, or that you take bad setups when you’re bored.

Your trading journal becomes your mirror. It forces you to face the truth instead of lying to yourself with hindsight. Over time, it’s less about “what did the chart do” and more about “why did I react this way.” That self-awareness is where growth happens, and without it, you’ll keep repeating the same mistakes.

4. Keep your setup simple.

When you’re new, you want to believe the answer is some secret indicator or complex strategy nobody else knows. So you start stacking indicators until your chart looks like Times Square. I went through that phase too. But after years of testing, I came back to the basics: clean price action, volume, and maybe one or two moving averages. That’s it.

The market isn’t hiding anything from you. Overcomplication just creates decision paralysis. The pros aren’t out here with 15 indicators... they’re reading levels, momentum, and supply/demand zones. Keep your charts clean, focus on setups you can repeat, and you’ll save yourself years of frustration.

5. Protect your mental health.

Trading will wreck you if you let it. If you’re risking rent money or grocery money, you’re trading scared, and scared traders make terrible decisions. You’ll cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and constantly feel like your back’s against the wall. That’s not trading, that’s gambling under pressure.

Detach yourself from the outcome of any single trade. This is easier said than done, but the only way to do it is by trading money you can afford to lose and keeping size small until you’re consistent. If a red day ruins your mood for 24 hours, you’re too emotionally tied to your positions. Protect your headspace first; the money follows when you’re calm.

6. Learn from screen time, not YouTube gurus.

There’s a ton of content online, but no video or course will replace actually watching the market tick by tick. You need screen time to understand how price moves, how news impacts volatility, and how momentum builds and fades. That “intuition” you see in experienced traders doesn’t come from books, it comes from thousands of hours watching patterns unfold live.

Don’t get me wrong, you can pick up useful basics from videos. But the real learning happens when you put skin in the game, track your trades, and experience the emotions firsthand. Nobody can teach you how you react to fear and greed, that’s something only screen time reveals.

7. Consistency > home runs.

The biggest misconception beginners have is thinking they need a massive trade to “make it.” They see screenshots of 10k days on Twitter and start chasing jackpots. The truth is, most accounts blow up because people swing for the fences. Survival in this game comes from small, consistent wins while keeping losses tiny.

A steady $100 a day, compounded, crushes the guy who tries to make $1,000 in one shot and wipes half his account. The math is simple, but the ego makes it hard to follow. Focus on consistency, build confidence, and scale later. Day trading is a marathon of small edges, not a lottery ticket.

Bottom line.

Day trading isn’t easy. Most people fail not because they can’t read charts, but because they underestimate how much discipline, patience, and emotional control it really takes. If you treat this like a craft instead of a get-rich-quick scheme, you’ll give yourself a real shot.

I really like this community so plan on doing more write-ups like these as a mini education series. If you guys want, my next one can be about

A) The biggest mistakes I made in my first year of day trading (so you don’t have to)

B) What a ‘normal’ day actually looks like as a full-time day trader

C) Why 90% of traders quit in under 2 years (and how not to be one of them)

Just drop your vote. I don't mind writing up something for all 3.

1nlxryy,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 09:09:38,Dropping Construction for Trading—Need Advice and Perspective,"Hey everyone, I just got into trading and I have to say, it’s fucking exciting. I love how, once you learn the basics, it’s all about predicting where the price action is heading based on probability — which I find really cool. The more I get into it, the more I want to leave my crane internship and my mentor behind to focus full-time on trading. 

My construction job varies week to week—sometimes I work 80 hours, other times only 40, but usually it’s between 40 and 80 hours. I’ve been at this job for almost six months now. Honestly, I don’t even love the construction work; I kind of hate it. It’s exhausting, and I just feel like I could be doing something more fulfilling, like trading at home because it’s fun.

I also have about $7,000 saved up, which I think could give me some room to learn and grow as a trader without risking everything right away. I’m considering going back to serving and studying full-time, like I did before I got into construction, since my schedule makes it tough to trade in the mornings when I work. I don’t have debt, but my dad struggles with alcohol dependence and depression, which is really tough emotionally. Sometimes I worry he might pass away suddenly, and that scares me. On the other hand, I feel like I should’ve done more to help him, and that’s been weighing on me.

My crane mentor really supports me and keeps saying I’ll be a great crane operator. I think it’s mostly because he appreciates my go-getter attitude and work ethic, but honestly, can all that hard work not go into trading instead? I’m only 21, but I can’t shake the feeling that I could’ve done more with my life. I don’t even really know why I got into construction in the first place—maybe I thought it was the safe or expected thing, but my real passion is trading.

I want to build a life trading because that’s what excites me, not construction or crane work. I just want to figure out how to focus on trading, make a living from it, and maybe take more control over my life without stressing myself out.

Seriously I’m sorry but how dumb do you have to be to make so much money then lose it all? In the beginning? Fine. But after you’ve made all this money?  Unless you’re blowing all your money on options or stupid horrible useless penny stocks, it’s literally hard to blow an entire account. 

Also, this whole options thing is laughable. Like when I tried it I didn’t like the idea of winning 400 , losing 700 , winning 600 constantly every single day. People are out here doing that with 10s of thousands of dollars????????? Not just that. Why in the world do you feel the need to take all the money you made from an options trade, then throw it in a new options trade and then some?

How often should I be checking up on the overall performance of the stock? For example, Invested in a quantum stock 2 days ago, was already up 7% and sold for profit. I'm not afraid of taxes as long as I'm making profit and reinvesting in other companies that are moving fast.

Should I be checking them everyday, every week? I know trends move and money flows... I've been keeping tight numbers of whats doing good etc... I have long term investments and short term, but the short term is what I want to be watching.

Saw a post somewhere that said 15% profit on stocks are a good exit? Obviously doing this comes risk of missing a potential runner like (PLTR,NVDA) if I were to find that startup company early and selling for a short gain.

I wanted to combine my interest in finance, art, and app dev, so I came up with a different type of stock market simulator, where you learn about investing by collecting creatures!

You can enter real stock tickers and decide whether to long/short, and each stock will represent either a bull (long) or bear (short).

Speaking from personal experience, I believe financial literacy and an early understanding of markets can be incredibly valuable for students as they prepare for the future. My prototype still needs a lot of refining, so I would appreciate any feedback!

Here’s the app's core mechanic: you make real stock price predictions. If you think a stock will go up (i.e. “long” a stock), you hatch a bull; if you think it’ll go down (i.e., “short” a stock), you hatch a bear. If your prediction is wrong, your creature loses health, but you can use potions to heal it. Each potion teaches a basic investing concept, like how earnings reports or interest rates affect prices, while improving your creature’s stats. You can also level up for evolution. It’s kind of like Duolingo meets Tamagotchi, but for the stock market.

I created customized indicators that mixes volume, statistics (i.e., kernel density estimation, etc), and conventional technical analysis equipment (i.e., fibonacci retracement, customized volume profile).

**Abstract**

I conducted a series of manual trades operating between August and September (\~2 months). I decided with 200 trades to create a robust sample size for reliability.

Listed on BINANCE, 26 cryptocurrencies were selected as part of the 200 trades via simple random sampling, with some stratification variability.

* SHELLUSDT.P, STRKUSDT.P, NOTUSDT.P, MYROUSDT.P, BRETTUSDT.P, MOODENGUSDT.P, DEGENUSDT.P, SPELLUSDT.P, BIGTIMEUSDT.P, PIPPINUSDT.P, ACHUSDT.P, OPUSDT.P, KAVAUSDT.P, GALAUSDT.P, DOGSUSDT.P, TRUMPUSDT.P, WUSDT.P, VETUSDT.P, TURBOUSDT.P, AAVEUSDT.P, ROSEUSDT.P, PENGUUSDT.P, REZUSDT.P, DOGEUSDT.P, XRPUSDT.P, and ENAUSDT.P

I started with $100.00 as my initial capital.

* RRR = 1:1
* Leverage: 5x
* Commission fees accounted for

Null hypothesis: The true win-rate is equal to random chance; = 0.50.

Alternative hypothesis: The true win-rate is greater than random chance; > 0.50.

**Results**

* Win-rate: 65.5% in 200 trades (Risk-to-reward ratio = 1:1)
* Net profit: +1552% (i.e., $100.00 -> $1552.41)

**Conclusion**

Test for statistical significance: one-sample proportion z-test

Level of significance: 5%

p-value ≈ 5.82 × 10⁻⁶

Interpretation: We reject the null hypothesis. The strategy's observed win-rate is statistically significantly higher than 50% at conventional significance levels (p = 0.00000582, 95% CI (0.587, 0.717)).

Ok so now the abstract is done (just know that my results are not random). Below presents several charts that highlight interesting visuals.

Figure 5: Stratified per-symbol win-rate (bootstrapped)

[This one is interesting. It is important to note that ENAUSDT.P is only a sample size of 1, which happened to be a loss.](https://preview.redd.it/m9sp8bk8u4qf1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=db6aa7e197cf6f69c388068fd53941c266669373)

**Limitations**

This strategy was done by manual backtesting. Although objectivity was attempted to be maintained at all costs, they may still be possibility of potential losses that were missed during the backtesting period. However, this is unlikely due to the statistically significant result as shown by the p-value.

**My notes**

I kinda wanted to do this for a while and share to the community that daytrading any cryptocurrency and succeeding (without doing any personal analysis) is possible. It just takes a LOT of time. I am also incredibly surprised the effectiveness of fibonacci and volume profile, but according to my testing, it's not very significant. However, they do boost win rate a little bit.

In the first two months, I absorbed a lot of content, survived the “gambling mode,” and studied the basics (TJR Bootcamp — and please, don’t start saying it’s not good; it helped me understand the fundamentals). Along with TJR and other traders like Kevin Furest and Trader Nocturno, I built a strategy. It’s not entirely mine — it’s more a mix of their points of view.

After that, I spent a month “trading” on TradingView, just setting my entries, SL, and TP. I took 5 trades on XAUUSD that month and won 4 out of 5, making a 7% profit with a 1:2 RR between 9–12 a.m. I knew it wasn’t enough, but I decided to open a demo account on MetaTrader.

August and the first half of September were tough: FOMO, overtrading, seeing trades that weren’t there… losing 7% in a row. Feeling lost, with pressure in my chest, I went back to my philosophy — Stoicism.

After an entire afternoon thinking, meditating, and reviewing my entries from August and September (I keep a journal), I realized I wasn’t sticking to my plan. This month, I’m making sure not to skip my plan. But here’s the thing: I feel like I’m missing something — that little piece that will make everything click in my mind.

I know I need experience and discipline. I’m improving every day by completing small tasks like exercising, using my phone less, eating healthy, and reading books. I’m doing it. But I still feel I’m not reading the market well and not making the best decisions.

1nkxqhb,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 04:11:13,Why News Trading Can Be Risky for Beginners,"
News trading can look exciting — sharp market moves, fast profits, and high energy. But for beginners, it often turns into unnecessary risk. Major news events (like NFP, CPI, or rate decisions) cause sudden spikes in volatility. Prices can move unpredictably, spreads widen, and slippage can eat into trades instantly.

Without experience, it’s easy to get caught on the wrong side of these moves, turning what seemed like a golden opportunity into a big loss. That’s why most new traders are better off mastering technical setups, risk management, and discipline before stepping into news-driven markets.

1nkt7bl,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 23:45:39,How backtesting changed everything for me.,"I want to share something I wish I understood way earlier in my trading journey: backtesting isn’t about finding the holy grail. It’s about gaining the confidence that your edge actually works and learning to trust it even when the market throws noise at you.

https://preview.redd.it/njy0vhrcm1qf1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee5b3f09ffeaa51aa20dc6782a6f5fdf7d595a7a

Over the last couple of months, I went all-in on backtesting my strategy. Here are my raw stats:



76 trades logged



Net P&L: $45,622.81



Trade win rate: 69.44%



Session win rate: 100% (8/8 sessions green)



Profit factor: 5.31



Trade expectancy: $634



Max drawdown: -$2,912



Average win vs loss: $1,120 vs -$481

https://preview.redd.it/8c15cetdm1qf1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=b710594127dac65dd936103e55e6bf50fb6e4c8d

The equity curve says it all, steady growth, small drawdowns (except one which is normal)  and compounding confidence.



What I Learned from Backtesting



The truth about “high win rate” strategies

Most strategies with 80-90% win rates look good short-term, but collapse once volatility shifts. I learned it’s not about being right every time, it’s about being consistent and protecting downside. My 40-70% win rate worked because my average win was more than double my average loss.



Drawdowns are inevitable

Even in a $45K stretch, I still faced a -$2,900 drawdown. Most traders quit at this point, thinking their strategy is broken. Backtesting taught me that drawdowns aren’t failure, they’re the cost of doing business.



20-30% annual returns are the sweet spot

The dream of doubling your account every year is usually what kills traders. But with backtesting, I saw firsthand that 20-30% annual returns, paired with prop firm capital, is enough to change your life. It’s not flashy, but it’s sustainable.



Confidence comes from data

When you’ve seen your setup play out across months of data, you stop second-guessing yourself in live trading. You stop jumping between strategies. You stop thinking every red day means you’re “broken.” 

I understand that live trading is definitly not the same as backtesting but any supplement of confidence can make a massive difference wehen you hit the markets and can help you preserve your money.



https://preview.redd.it/kap96iqfm1qf1.png?width=1702&format=png&auto=webp&s=7692d735092de28ce0c4199b5b8ce0896ee4c44c

Why Backtesting Changed My Mindset



Before, I’d take a couple of live trades, lose, and assume my edge was gone. I’d switch indicators, try a new YouTube setup, or even buy a course, lord knows I got scammed on so many courses, and some usefuul but just did not resonate with me.



Now, I know that my strategy has a proven expectancy. I know what my win rate is, I know what my drawdowns look like, and I know what kind of return I can expect if I stick with it. That kind of conviction is what separates traders who last from traders who blow up.



Backtesting also made me realize how much time I was wasting in Excel. Logging every trade manually, trying to track profits/losses, drawdowns, win rates… it became a headache. 



Final Thoughts



If you’re serious about trading, backtest your strategy. Not one weekend, not just 20 trades, do it for months. Track everything. Look at expectancy, drawdowns, and long-term performance.

If you want a plan, do it for a full 3months, every single day, go through bullish and bearish marlet cycles, see what ticker or if futures/forex works best for you.



There’s no holy grail strategy. But there is a holy grail process:



Build a simple edge.



Backtest it.



Refine it.



Gain confidence in it.



Then execute it in real-time with discipline.



I’ll leave you with this: your confidence as a trader will never come from watching someone else’s chart, it comes from seeing your own edge play out over and over again.



Now I’m curious:

For those of you who’ve backtested your own setups, what was the biggest realization you had?

* Time of day you can realistically trade (not **idealized** \- **realistically**)
* Knowing in advance if you need to sleep or work through certain sessions & what that means for your trading execution
* Do you want to hold trades overnight or not & is it compatible with your system (yes or no, on a strategy-by-strategy basis)
* How much capital will you trade with (eventually)?

**Why? Because all rule-building happens within constraints.**  
If you work a day job and trade 5m charts, you’re probably not able to trade the New York session. If you only trade during London session, you don’t build rules around Asian session. It really depends on time zones and other factors. Higher timeframes like hourly allow for higher versatility.

Ignoring constraints is why a lot of retail traders go nowhere – they copy others without aligning their system with their actual life. If you're ""trading here and there""/""when I can trade, I do X,"" it's adding noise to your results. The more variance in consistency, the worse it is for your bottom line.

# Pick One Market & Timeframe

**You don’t experiment with everything. Pick one instrument and one timeframe.**

For example: Dow Jones, hourly chart

**Why? Because markets behave differently.** Trying to make a system that works on Nasdaq, Gold, EURUSD, and Dow Jones at once is usually unwise. You will overfit or your strategy will break.

**One market. One behaviour set/trade setup.** If you want to run multiple instruments or setups/systems, split the risk amongst them. Each one should be good enough to isolate the risk and perform on its own.

**You must understand how your chosen market behaves. \[3\] & \[5\]**  
**Mean reverting, Alternating/Near Random Walk or Trending**

**Examples**  
Mean reverting: Dow Jones/YM, EURUSD  
Alternating/Near Random Walk: S&P 500/ES  
Trending: Nasdaq/NQ

You can do research to know which is which but if you want in-depth you can ask AI to use Hurst Exponent & Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test over market data.

Or if you're into programming you can get python script to do it. ADF Visuals + Hurst Exponential Chart Example

# Start Building with Logic, Not Results

To clarify, when you're learning, it's okay to look at charts for a while to familiarise yourself with how they look and what the candlesticks show.

The key is to avoid falling into the trap of confirmation bias. **You should write down an idea first, then test it.** **Do not change your rules as you go along.** And most importantly!

**Never go searching through charts to find ideas to test.**

**Start at the drawing board not the candlesticks.**  
Forget indicators. Forget entries. First you need structure. Here's what to make rules about:

**1. Trade Time Window**  
Define which hours are “valid” for entering trades, based on when your chosen market has high volume.  
**Example:** 8am to 4pm NY time for US indices.

**Why?** Because you need volatility to reach targets & volume at your entries for price to trend in your favour regardless of your system style (reversals, mean reversion or trend trading).

**Ex. Rule:**  
“I only take trades between 3pm and 9pm UK time.”

You can mark this with a sessions indicator (e.g. ""Sessions on Chart"" on TradingView, 10:00 to 16:00 setting).

# Risk Management

**Decide what you’re risking per trade.** Fixed % (e.g., 3% of account).  
In a live environment this value can be based on risk tolerance. It must be a logical value that fits within your goals, limits and needs. Your risk needs to be planned ahead, and stuck to. Your risk can be static or dynamic.

**For prop firms, you must calculate your risk to fall in line with the maximum drawdown rules.**

The Amount risked has to be calculated with maximum drawdown & maximum daily drawdown in heavy consideration.

For example, someone may have a system with a loss equivalent to 10 losses in a row -10R maximum in testing his prop firm allows up to 10% maximum drawdown so he decides to trade 0.6% per trade allowing him to have space for that maximum peak to trough drawdown + 50% extra.

**Dynamic example:**  
More Aggressive traders may opt in for back tested rules to increase risk when holding on profitable running positions ex. Entering another position on another rejection (scaling in) or having pre-defined plans to increase risk during winning or losing periods in live environments depending on their risk tolerance & goals.

**Decide what your target-to-stop-loss ratio is before testing the system and stick with it (e.g., RRR: 2:1, 5:1, etc.).**

Don't adjust this to get better trading performance - **pick it based on logic, not data.**

Ex. Rule: “I aim for 4-5R on all reversal trades"" &/or ""3-4R on continuation trades.”

**If the system doesn't work, I throw it out.**

**Added Annotation for clarity: Find \[1\] At end of doc**

# Entry Style (Define Setup Type)

**Bar Replay backtest only.** Never scroll backward to ‘check’ the setup again.

**Pick something linear and logical.**  
Mean reversion? Reversals? Continuations? Breakouts?

Then ask: **What does that look like?**  
Do I want price to hit a level and reject (reversal)?  
Do I want price to push through and pull back (breakout/continuation)?  
**And why would it work?** What does my setup signify via **order flow mechanics**? **\[5\]**

**Order flow isn’t a system or strategy like educators teach.**  
**It’s the basics of how markets move on a tick-by-tick basis.**

**Basic Example explanation:** 

If there's a buyer at $10,000.25 who wants 100 units, but only 80 are available, price moves up one tick to $10,000.5 to fill the rest.

**Ex. 10000.5 50 available 10000.25 80 available**

He gets **80 filled at 10000.25 and 20 (the rest) at 10000.5**

(10000.25\*(80/100))+(10000.5\*(20/100)) = **10000.3 average**

price fill -> price increased to **10000.5**

# This is liquidity.

The only reason price moves is that there’s an imbalance between buy and sell volume. Nothing else

**That's why markets have a highly random nature. Example at Bonus 2**

Tick = minimum price movement on an instrument.

**Example purposes only: 3-wick reversal**

https://preview.redd.it/vbdtsa8hvzpf1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=810d0b202468627ca8a9a7640688943a260c6d5c

**3 Wick Entry Rule example purposes only:**  
“I place limit orders at the beginning wick of a 2-wick consecutive rejection if it forms and closes during my valid trading hours.”  
3 – Sell Limit Filled, Limit order pulled/expired if no fill on **bar 3**

https://reddit.com/link/1nklchw/video/4tg691xnvzpf1/player

**Short example using Order Flow Mechanics Knowledge \[5\]:**  
A wick high in a candle is rejected by the next candle and it closes. Sellers were present at that wick. Regardless of how the ""Order flow"" had taken place it is **irrefutable**.

If price revisits that price or higher and fails again, closing, I want to sell at that price - expecting a third rejection.

**Sell limit order fill, Bracketed with SL & TP (values known before the close)**

Vice versa for long setups.

**Most people who overcomplicate with “smart money” or “institutional”. Talk are waffling.**

# “If you are using charts to execute, you aren't smart money but you don't have to be dumb money either.”

**Dismiss educator narratives on why their methods supposedly work and use critical thinking applying Order flow mechanic basics to accept or dismiss trading entry ideas.**

Don't sleep walk into the ""institutional"" narrative fallacy’s educators sell you. Think about why price moves on a tick by tick basis and what the candlesticks you're basing your entry off actually indicate.

**Markets aren't ruled by patterns they're ruled by imbalances that's what fuels trends. Without an imbalance price won't move.**

If a setup doesn’t have logic like this backing up why it would succeed enough for it to be profitable besides randomness, you’re wasting your time.

# If your only answer to “why does it work?” is “my backtest says so,” you’re doomed

**I’ve asked a trader why he believes his system works besides his data and silence followed for minutes whilst he tried thinking of what to say. I shown him random OHLC candlesticks with his strategy applied and he thrown in the towel. Don’t be like this.**

https://reddit.com/link/1nklchw/video/t1tvferkvzpf1/player

**Examples of what not to base your system on:**

* Pivot points
* Fibonacci (**Based on faith and crowding**)
* MA bounces (**Random and seen on many data sets** ) Shown on Bonus 2 Fig.
* Complex multi-timeframe analysis (**Hard to quantify and bar replay backtest honestly without hindsight fogging vision**)
* Most **well known** indicators for entries

These methods are 1000% random with weak foundations or are purposefully hard to test accurately and honestly without overfitting. **Educators push it for plausible deniability when systems don’t perform. A model is hard to hold to account if there’s 1000 ways to trade it. The use of Multi time frame analysis in trading is fine as long as it’s not convoluted, has clear rules and is tested properly.**

# Target & Stop Loss Placement

**Targets must be placed consistently.**  
Targets are typically less important than entries and stops – but still important.

If using price structures (e.g. support/resistance), **define the logic first**, then the rules.

Ex. Someone could use swing highs/lows, support/resistance,

clustered wicks or rejection zones. **With fixed rules to define and mark them in advance.**

Price will naturally attract volume at these levels, **even if the instrument's order book volume doesn't reflect it in real time**. Ghost limit orders exist, pending stop orders & order fill algorithm triggers from **countless market participants for different reasons** it doesn't matter what happens when price interacts with these places it's just more often than not that they are **liquid areas**.

**Avoid fixed-distance targets - market volatility is dynamic.**

For example, a ""100 point fixed target"" or a ""20 point fixed stop"" is arbitrary and is not going to work if volatility shifts.

It is better to use dynamic yet consistent targeting methods. A trader must define fixed rules for regarding what is S/R and what is not.

So a dynamic targeting method ex. at defined highs or lows would be that for one trade it is 110 points, the second being 160 points, and the next is 140 points (all placed at predefined levels).

**Fixed targets overfit strategies easily.**

Your **execution costs** must be factored into your system.

Ex. 

If you use a 1:5 RR and a 100-pt target minimum, your minimum stop is 20 pts. 

If your max spread on your CFD is \~2pts, that’s 10% cost per trade - before everything else which matters.

Ex Rule: 

“Target is always ≥100 points for Dow. Stop is one-fifth of target.” - Why? Because it keeps costs at a modest level.

# Instrument-Specific Rules

**Some markets behave uniquely. You don’t need deep stats – just basic experience.**

* Nasdaq trends
* Dow mean reverts
* S&P 500 alternates. (Trending but Near random walk)
* Gold is erratic

Example: If you want mean reversion or early trend entries, Dow is a better choice than Nasdaq.

**Entry Model Influence Example:**  
**Example 1:** If you want mean reversion or early trend entries, Dow is a better choice than Nasdaq. (It’s more probable for Dow reverse intraday)  
**Example 2:** If you want to press trades or let positions run, Nasdaq is a better choice than Dow. (Trends are more pronounced on Nasdaq compared to Dow intraday)  
Either can have a trend or mean reversion model, but different strategies will tend to work better if aligned with the instrument’s nature.

**Strategy Risk Management Setup Influence Examples:**  
**Example 1:** If you have a strategy idea that includes rules to manually trail your stop loss in profit or uses large targets relative to stop size, Nasdaq would likely be a better choice compared to Dow. (Nasdaq trends more intraday which compliments this idea; Dow tends to mean revert/snap back, reducing the potential for home run trades.)  
**Example 2:** If you have a mean reversion strategy idea with a hard take profit and stop loss as risk management (most common), the Dow would likely be a better choice, as its intraday trends are less pronounced compared to the Nasdaq.

 

**Either market can have a trend and/or mean reversion model**, but different entry and risk management strategies will tend to work better if aligned with the instrument’s nature;

# These guidelines are of course not absolutes.

**Trending = Larger price extensions**, **Mean reversion = Higher likelihood of returning to the average price.**

**ADF & Hurst isn’t supposed to be used in real time it’s supposed to be used once to define an instrument and save time testing. Don’t forget that.**

# Start from Blank Charts

Instead of top-down start bottom up.

People look at charts for ideas when you need to **consult logic for inspiration**; **not recency biases from recent price action**. **Added Annotation for clarity: Find \[2\] At end of doc**

Back testing is there to put an idea to the test.

**Before building rules based on the chart, define a hypothesis.**

**Example:** 

**“What if I traded Dow Jones reversals using 3-wick setups with a 5R limit entry?”**

Then test this visually. On charts

**You’re not trying to make it “fit,” but to ask:**

*- Does this work during valid hours?* 

*- Does the visual match my logic?* 

*- Does the reaction make sense knowing Order flow’s nature?* 

*- Would my setup realistically hit target often enough to net a profit over time?*

**Only then write rules to test.**

# Write Rules as If You’re Giving Them to a Machine

**Your rules must be:**

* **Objective**
* **Actionable**
* **Not open to interpretation**
* **Modest costs ideally <20% Don’t let it exceed 30% of your expected R or your edge collapses (Exponential costs)** ex. If you risk $100 and your RR is 5:1 but after adding spread, comms and other costs like slippage it’s >3.5R / >70% of R realised minimum>$350 minimum on each 5R setup

**Bad Rule:**  
“If the market is ranging, I don’t trade.” **(No definition for range or how to identify it)**

**Good Rule:**  
“If a 3-wick setup forms between 3–9pm UK time, and the high/low of setup is beyond/below \[X filter\], place sell limit at top wick or buy limit at low wick.” **(Rule based intuition/discretion free)**

**Define everything clearly** \- the filter, logic, conditions, etc.

# Stress Test the System by Breaking It

**Once rules are written, test them brutally.** 

Ask:

\- Is this rule based on **logic** or **emotional comfort?** **Be emotionally detached**

  (ex. Breakeven or partial profits reduce strategy net profit - so why use them?)\*

Partials or Breakeven reduce strategy expectancy more often than not\*

\- Does it work over 3+ months of data? (Depending on timeframe)

1R = 1 unit of risk ex. 3%

Log the data, process it -1R+4R-1R-1R+4R

# - What if market conditions flip? (Test on conditions against the system's nature)

Test mean reversion and reversal systems on trending weeks & if you're trading trend trading systems test them on mean reverting/ranging weeks. See your system struggle. Example (Surface Level)

Date Example August 8**^(th)** to September 13**^(th)** **2024 on mean reversion systems for YM/Dow Jones is a good place to stress test due to the relentless intraday trends exhibited.**

**- What if trading costs rise 20%? (Reduce size of profits by \~20%)**

\- after the initial rejection candle close if there is an additional rejection should I scale in/increase the risk on the trade (Entry 2 typically has higher win rate vs Entry 1 when scaling in for my systems\*\*) testing will confirm whether it's worth doing\*\*. **To scale in or not to scale in**

Scaling in is only worth doing is the win rate if Entry 2 is superior to that of Entry 1 ex. 45% winrate Entry 2 vs 40% winrate (main entries) most systems don't benefit largely from it so **be careful.**

**Entry = Individual Trade Execution (filled with 1R risk per trade ex, 3%) 2 Entries = 3% \* 2 = 6% for example.**

**- Should I hedge or wait until my position is closed to enter setups on the opposite direction?**

**-Is it worth holding overnight?**

**-Do I have enough leverage/margin to trade this strategy on my broker or prop firm of choice (find out the leverage needed maximum per trade with stop distance % relative to % risk per trade desired)**

# You're not seeking perfection, but robustness. 

**If a small change breaks your system - it’s overfit noise.**

# Bonus: When in Doubt, Zoom Out

**Ask: Does this decision happen every trade?**  
If yes, write a rule. If not, STOP, think, and evaluate the logic.

**You should:**

* **Know your risk % – make a rule**
* **Know your stop – make a rule**
* **Aim to know target, stop, and entry price(s) before the candle closes  (Bracketed limit orders help a lot.)**

# Bonus 2: Market Randomness

**I’m not saying the market is efficient, I’m saying it’s very close so you need to be refined in your approach. It’s not a choice**

# Added Annotations [4]:

**\[1\] The specific ratios don't matter. You shouldn't be curve fitting/overfitting your system (trying to find the best ratio)**

Elaboration:

The logic in the example behind using 3-4R in continuation trades is that you should allow for larger movements against your entry because you're entering in the middle of a trend. For example, when trend following, if you're buying, you are executing at premium prices, not at discount prices. more space for error is required.

And 4-5 Ratio for example is encouraging tighter stop losses relative to target for Reversals because you're actively going against the trend.

The ratios given were example ratios you can change them based on your ideas.

**\[2\] When I mean consult logic, I meant order flow mechanics \[3\] which I mention in the document primarily but it's also about rejecting ideas like MA Bounces and Fibonacci which aren't logical reasons to engage with the markets.**

Wick high = selling pressure

Wick low = buying pressure

Body = sustained buying or selling within the time slot on the data series/chart

Use this knowledge to create your own ideas for logical trade entry systems to test

**\[3\] ADF & Hurst Exponent Overview**

ADF shows you if a data series/chart reverts to it’s mean (average price)

Hurst tells you if a data series/chart trends, reverts or leans towards a random walk. Helps decide trending market vs mean reverting market.

**1. ADF Test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller)**

What it ADF tells you in practice:

ADF checks whether a time series is mean-reverting i.e., do things tend to wander off indefinitely, or does it tend to return to some average value over time elapsed.

If the ADF test is “significant” (p-value < 0.05):

The series does revert to a mean.

When a time series ex a candlestick chart is mean reverting imagine price is like a stretched rubber band when it moves away from the average, it tends to snap back/reverse.

If it's not significant (p-value > 0.05):

The series is likely a random walk, drifting unpredictably without any sort of central anchor.

2. Hurst Exponent

What Hurst tells you in practice:

It quantifies how “trendy” or “mean-reverting” a time series is.

H ≈ 0.5 The chart/time series is random noise; random walk/Brownian motion.

H < 0.5 → The chart is mean-reverting tends to snap back.

H > 0.5 → The chart has momentum tends to have extensions/continuation in the same direction i.e trend.

**Key Changes in Version 2 \[4\]:**

Many small tweaks for clarity, added important clarifications especially on Step 7, included annotations for context, and I’ve provided definitions to support beginners.

The model hasn’t changed it’s just explained better. Changes were based on trader insights and needs. Thanks for the feedback. I Appreciate it – Ron.

# TL;DR & Summary:

**Structure before everything.**  
**Logic before data.**  
**Consistency before optimization.**  
Logic → Rules → Data → Optimisation **(Based on ideas, not data or it’s curve fitting)“Why” before “What.”**

**Every rule is based on:**

1. **What you can realistically do**
2. **What the market allows** (ex scalping CFDs is usually not a viable strategy due to higher or exaggerated costs on higher lot sizes) 
3. **What gives clear, repeatable decisions**

**You don’t optimize to improve win rate or net gain.**  
You optimize to enhance the logic behind the system – which often translates to improved performance (net gain)

Yes – the first 0–20 hours (first few testing sessions) will feel foggy. Then it clicks.  
You’ll never know if it works until you test it exactly as written.  
That’s when the market becomes your teacher.

If a system implodes/stops working it doesn't mean a different variation of it can't work again in the future.

1nkkj55,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 17:12:05,20 years of trading: my biggest mistakes & lessons,"I’ve been trading for about 20 years now, and looking back, most of my setbacks weren’t about having the “wrong” strategy, honestly, they were just about my own behavior (as hard as that is to admit).

The two biggest mistakes I made early on:

1. **Selling winners too early.** I can’t count the times I sold stocks like Meta or Nvidia after a quick 2x, only to watch them 10x or 100x later. The short-term mindset killed me. If you really believe in a company and have done the work, sometimes the best move is to sit on your hands and let time do the heavy lifting.
2. **Not focusing on my edge.** Most of my losses came from chasing trends outside of my lane. Where I’ve consistently done well is riding blue chips and staying in areas where I actually understand the fundamentals. It’s boring sometimes, but boring makes money as much as people on social media preach the opposite.

If I could give my younger self advice:

* Journal every trade so you can see your *own* patterns (good and bad).
* Don’t force setups just to feel active — patience > action.
* Protect your mental capital. Trading scared is worse than not trading at all.

That’s just my take though. So, I’m curious, for those of you with more years under your belt: what’s the #1 mistake you wish you could go back and avoid?",24,4,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nkkj55/20_years_of_trading_my_biggest_mistakes_lessons/,new,Advice,0.86

1nkhybe,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 15:33:31,Trading Is the Hardest Thing I’ve Ever Done,"

I grew up in a small town in Mexico. My parents worked jobs that barely kept food on the table, and from a young age, I knew if I wanted something more, I’d have to figure it out myself. At 19, I crossed the border with nothing but a backpack, a few clothes, and a dream of building a better life.

I washed dishes, stocked shelves overnight, and sent money home when I could. I shared a one-bedroom apartment with three other guys just to cover rent. Some weeks I worked 70–80 hours, only to end up with barely enough left to buy groceries. It was exhausting, but I kept telling myself, “This is temporary, justy keep moving.”

Then I discovered amazon FBA, failed. Dropshipping, failed and then finallly trading. I thought it would be my escape, finally a way to use my brain instead of my back. I opened a brokerage account, put in a few thousand dollars, and thought I could flip it fast. I lost it all in less than two months. The frustration was unreal. I felt like I was running in circles: breaking my body at work, then burning through savings at night chasing green candles.

But I didn’t quit. I slowed down and started studying. I found futures and realized this was a real profession, not a shortcut. I backtested for months. I journaled every mistake. I cut my size to the smallest possible and focused on surviving first. Slowly, things started to click. My first payout from a prop firm wasn’t big, just $1,000 but it felt like the world to me. It proved I wasn’t crazy for believing I could do this.

Here’s what trading taught me: it’s not a hustle, it’s a mirror. It shows you every weakness and impatience, ego, greed and forces you to deal with them. That’s why it’s harder than any job I’ve ever worked. Because it doesn’t just demand skill; it demands you to change who you are.

Today, I’m not rich, but I’m consistent. I can finally say I trade with confidence. I still send money home. I still live simply. But I built this life from nothing, and that’s something no one can take from me.

And if there’s one thing I know for sure:

1nkclol,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 12:13:24,Trying to find trading for my risk tolerance and personality,"EDIT: Title should say trading/investing strategies.    
  
FYI, I have another thread on the bogle head and I have some indexes I've picked and going to see how they do.  However, I'm curious as to others in my situation and mindset, what strategies have you went with and why.  Also, what tools, data etc are you using.

For me, I get stock purchases every quarter at a discount some options.  So that's what put me in the market many years ago.  I just never looked at it until around 2020 where I got more aggressive on also doing a large paycheck contribution as well.

This past year, things have really taken off, I have nvda like everybody, then other mag 7 because I believe in AI and the changes it's going to make.  I have had the voo's, schg's etc.

In April, like everybody else, heart sank when taking those kinds of loses but I've always looked at the market like calculated gambling so easy come easy go.  But then the recovery has been a sight to watch.

So now, I have some of the boglehead strategy to see how it does.  Some in high yield savings I'm looking to convert to bonds.

But I'd really like to start learning how to understand and pick companies without just knowing they are doing good in the tech industry and have a ""feeling"" they are going to do good.  My instincts told me to purchase Broadcom and Oracle a year ago, but I already have a lot in companies like nvda, the voice of reason keeps pulling me back to not be greedy and risk $ making 4.5% right now when I have quite a bit in equities.

However, I want to try and learn for example, BBW, when I go look at the performance of that the past few years, it's been better than Nvda.  In my paper trading account on alpaca, I'm up 5k in the past month on it and the indicators and reports I look at in Fidelity have it as good as anything I have invested.  But then i watch it daily, it's a lot more volatile than a nvda, msft, googl it seems.

So is so much out there and most seems it's more about getting $ from you on a proven strategy than actually being worthwhile.

I don't have time to day trade so not looking to scalp, I'm more so looking for ways to try and find good compound earners and learn how to take my current assets and have the work for me in a comfortable fashion without basically putting everything on black and letting it ride.

To be clear, I'm not asking for stock picks, a breakdown of large cap, small cap, bonds etc, just what others are doing if you just like to research, learn what companies are good or have the potential to do good and have a good idea of the upside and down side risk say the next 1/4, 6 months or year.

In summary, for somebody that just wants to research and find companies, indexes, etfs have potential to be the next palantir, nvda, probably a chatgpt if it ever goes public etc, and do so in a way that you know how to monitor and know when the indicators point to it's time to move on.

Also, not looking to put an entire portfolio into this, just going to start taking any extra change I have and start learning how.  What tools would you recommend?  Trading View with Alpaca, or there is [investor.com](http://investor.com) and others.  Also, would be curious as to why you use what you use as well.

Finally, I'm not young, not trying to get rich quick, but as I put in my post in the boglehead section, if I could figure out a way to comfortably take what I have an make 6 to 8% on average, then I'm lucky enough right now to be able to cover expenses and keep growing assets which for me would finally be freedom.  :)  Yes I'm researching and going through other recommendations but there is just so much and starting my own thread I can use in my search.",1,2,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nkclol/trying_to_find_trading_for_my_risk_tolerance_and/,new,Discussion,1.0
1nkbkcx,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 11:35:00,Thinking about Luck,"Probability and luck are not either/or. You don't need to exclusively subscribe to probability or exclusively subscribe to luck in stock market trading. I think this is where people face-off with absolute conviction to one or the other, but reading Taleb on luck and black swans, I'm starting to see that being a probability absolutist is nearly as bad as subscribing to having zero belief that anything you do will make a difference because it's all luck.

If you ignore the possibility of luck (good and bad), then you are missing a piece of the risk puzzle. Even if you don't change anything in your approach, it is advantageous to be aware of luck and to think about how it might impact your strategy.

The most important question for me being, am I doing enough to cover my arse if a piece of bad luck strikes. This doesn't necessarily mean becoming overly defensive, but the most basic means of protection is only investing what you can afford to lose. (This is the no. 1 trading rule based on luck.)

The thing I've changed based on this awareness of luck is to not be too exact with probability, and not treat it like I'm reading tea leaves of what will happen and that it remains a set of guidelines the accuracy of which only the real world will determine, so my probability margins must be meatily weighted towards profitability but be general enough to not simply cherry pick from the past.",1,3,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nkbkcx/thinking_about_luck/,new,Discussion,1.0

I post this to show you all out there that are struggling and that think you cannot do it what real trading looks like. A lot people say a lot of things, but no one really shows something real. This is real. This is my trading in my ThinkOrSwim account, honestly I am not sure if this is all year or what the exact time frame because when I change the dates not much changes. BUT, this is my performance. I want to you to notice a few things. 

1. I cut losses quickly. 

2. I have several good gainers from my basic strategy

3. I get lucky and get a big winner every once in a while! 

This has been fairly consistent for me over the past several years, I was profitable in 2017 and I haven't looked back! I caught, TSLA, NVDA and now IONQ those have been my big winners. But as shown in the screenshot I can make good money in many other names. If your account can look anywhere near this in terms of your losers being small and your winners being big then you will be successful at trading. 

I think its paramount to 100% believe that you are taking the right approach, my strategy is a mix of things, its IBD breakouts with options with my own mix of things I have noticed and learned over the years. I believe in market themes and CHARTS. 

I ALSO TIME THE MARKETS for all you saying you cannot time the markets. No YOU can't time the markets, but people do it every day. I trade several other accounts as well and have 10's 4 accounts with just leveraged ETFs and market timing.

Also notice that I was able to lose money on PLTR this year! No one is perfect, so don't judge 

I know eventually this post will get buried, but this is what it looks like when you manage your risk/reward levels, have patience when entering positions and are picky with what you trade.

The plan is straightforward, build a $15K cushion from trading profits alone before leaving my job. That gives me a full year of living expenses covered:

• $4,560 for my salary ($380 x 12 months)

I’m already accustomed to living lean and making ~$238/month at my current job, so survival isn’t the issue. The first three months after leaving won’t even be focused on trading. They’ll be about decompressing, appreciating life, and recharging before going all-in.

That’s it. No overcomplication, no delusion, just a base, a buffer, and time.

1nk9w4g,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 10:31:23,Ready to be embarrassed.. here are my biggest mistakes I made in my first year of trading...,"Lol when I first started messing around with stocks and option trading, I thought I was smarter than the market. I genuinely wanted to ""turn $1000 into $10000"" and just keep going. So, I watched all the videos, read all the stupid books, and figured I’d pick it up fast. Instead, my first year was a series of expensive lessons. It was bad. I blew up accounts, overtraded, and ignored the basics that I now know are non-negotiable. If you’re just starting out, i reaply wanted to write out my biggest mistakes I made that you can hopefully avoid. This is part 2 of an ongoing education series for those who are interested in following. Hopefully this can help some of you guys.

1. Trading too big, too soon.

Sizing up too fast was my downfall more than once. I thought the quickest way to grow an account was to swing big. The problem is, your emotions swing just as big. When you’re over-leveraged, you stop following your plan and start praying. That’s when panic selling, bag-holding, and account blow-ups happen.

Looking back, I should’ve kept my position size embarrassingly small until I was profitable for months at a time. Trading tiny builds discipline without wrecking your confidence or your account. The truth is, year one isn’t about making money, it’s about surviving long enough to actually get good.

2. Chasing alerts and hype.

Bruh, I spent months glued to X or reddit “gurus.” Every time they called out a ticker, I’d jump in without thinking. I almost always bought too late, and when the move reversed, I’d eat the loss. It felt like I was trading, but really I was just gambling on other people’s ideas.

The problem is you don’t have conviction in trades you didn’t find yourself. You’ll panic out the second it goes red, or hold too long hoping the guru is right. Once I ditched alerts and focused on building my own watchlists, my trading improved overnight. If you can’t explain why you’re in a trade, you shouldn’t be in it.

3. Ignoring stop losses.

This was my most expensive mistake. I’d set a stop, but when price got close I’d convince myself to “give it room.” Before I knew it, the loss was 3x what I planned. It only takes a couple of these to wreck your account and your headspace.

The truth is, honoring stops isn’t about being right or wrong; it’s about protecting your capital so you can trade another day. Blowing past stops is a rookie move that costs you money and keeps you stuck in a cycle of regret. If you only fix one mistake from this list, make it this one.

4. Overtrading out of boredom.

The urge to click buttons just to feel like you’re “doing something” is real. I’d sit there staring at charts, waiting for action, and eventually take subpar trades just to scratch the itch. Most of those turned into small, frustrating losses that added up.

Learning to do nothing when nothing’s there was one of the hardest skills I had to learn. Some days the best trade really is no trade. The market rewards patience, not action. Treat your trading capital like bullets; you don’t fire unless the target is clear.

5. Thinking strategy was everything.

In my first year, I hopped from one strategy to the next like a kid in a candy store. I thought I just hadn’t found the “holy grail” yet. The problem wasn’t the strategies... it was me. I wasn’t giving anything enough time to actually master it, and I wasn’t disciplined enough to stick to the rules.

What I eventually realized is that most strategies work if you execute them consistently and manage risk. Two traders can run the same setup (one profits, the other blows up) because psychology, discipline, and risk management matter more than the setup itself.

6. Not tracking my trades.

I went months without journaling or reviewing my trades. At the time, I thought I’d just “remember” what worked. Lol I didn’t... I repeated the same mistakes over and over because I had no system for holding myself accountable.

Once I started journaling (writing down why I entered, why I exited, and how I felt) I saw my patterns clear as day. I realized I revenge traded after losses, chased green candles, and cut winners too early. Tracking isn’t sexy, but it’s the only way to spot flaws in your behavior and actually fix them.

7. Not protecting my mental health.

Trading wrecked me emotionally that first year. I tied my self-worth to my P/L, so every red day felt like a personal failure. I’d overtrade trying to “make it back” or sit there depressed after one bad trade. That cycle burned me out.

The fix was learning to detach from the outcome of a single trade or even a single day. The only thing that matters is consistency over time. If you let your emotions run the show, you’ll destroy yourself. Protecting your mindset is just as important as protecting your account balance.


Take away

Your first year probably won’t make you rich. Mine didn’t. What it will do is teach you the lessons that separate gamblers from traders. Blowups, losses, and frustration are part of the process, but you don’t need to make all the same mistakes I did. Start small, track everything, respect risk, and don’t forget this is a long game. I plan on posting more here so feel free to follow my acc if you're interested.

1nk9ia5,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 10:16:30,How can i improve my strategy,"Core flow
	1.	Reference levels (HTF H/L): Uses previous 4H / Daily / Weekly / Monthly highs & lows (locked to the prior closed bar).
	2.	Sweep detection (on MTF): Detects when price sweeps above/below those HTF levels on a chosen MTF (mtfTF) with a small buffer and optional close condition.
	3.	MTF FVG confirmation: On the same MTF, confirms a bull/bear FVG (no repaint—uses confirmed bars only).
	•	When sweep + FVG align, it records the FVG range and the MTF swing (the pivot that “created” that FVG).
	4.	First Touch → “Strong” trigger (on LTF):
	•	Waits for First Touch of that MTF FVG on the LTF (close inside the zone).
	•	After FT, it arms a “strong” entry condition: requires a new LTF FVG in the same direction (optional minimum gap %).
	•	There’s a TTL (max bars to wait after FT) you can set; if it expires, the window closes.
	•	Safety: If the MTF swing that created the FVG breaks after FT, it stops searching for the LTF confirmation.
	5.	Filters:
	•	Killzones (UTC-4) time filter.
	•	AlphaTrend bias (optional): Only long when AT is rising, only short when falling.
	6.	Risk/Trade management:
	•	Position sizing by % of initial capital.
	•	SL can be based on LTF swing or the MTF swing that created the FVG (your choice), with optional pad %.
	•	Optional fixed TP by RR (e.g., 2R).
	7.	Visuals:
	•	Draws the MTF FVG zone (lines + optional fill).
	•	Draws a horizontal sweep line from the level’s previous HTF bar time to the bar that caused the sweep at the exact swept price (bull uses the low-side level, bear the high-side level).

It did not make the decision easy, but it did make the process structured and less about guesswork.

\-The few that are profitable wouldn’t waste their time debating candlesticks on    Reddit.

1njy68v,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 23:51:46,Risk management isn’t about protecting your account.,"Everyone says “use good risk management,” but most traders don’t understand what that really means. It’s not just about avoiding a blown account. It’s about making sure your head stays in the game.



When I sized too big, every tick against me felt like my stomach was dropping. I’d close trades early just to “feel safe,” or I’d add more size to “fix” a bad entry. It wasn’t the market beating me, it was my own emotions.



Once I started tracking everything, I noticed something insane: my win rate barely changed when I cut my size in half. But my stress level dropped by 80%. Suddenly, I was following my rules. Suddenly my setups actually had a chance to play out.



That’s when I learned: risk management isn’t about surviving one trade. It’s about giving yourself the mental space to survive the next 1,000 trades.



Profitable trading isn’t about swinging for home runs. It’s about staying alive long enough to let your edge work.

  
A lot of traders get too focused on the most perfect entry, but they should actually build a risk management system after they've found their edge and model.

- Psychology in a nutshell is = You understanding that your win or loss in this trade was just that the outcome fell on one side of the probability and the outcome should not affect you. 

- Market is always going to be uncertain and the setup that you intend to trade on, will also come in n number of forms, for you to accept or reject them. You have to accept the uncertainity. 

- Now, I think of myself as a trader inside the market ring. This really helps me with the right POV for the market. 

- Having realistic expectations from the market. Expect to make 150bps a week and not 500 or 1000bps a week because then, you will have to take unnecessary risk and high RR oppr. you will have to find and so on, which will make your trading though.

Basically, I wanted to see if there’s a way to measure the “WSB mood” before the rocket 🚀 or the rug 💀.

Problem:
	•	People don’t always write tickers with the $ symbol. Sometimes it’s just “TSLA” or “Nvidia” or “stonks.”
	•	I can grab the ones with $, but that misses like… 70% of the chatter.
	•	Some words are also tickers (e.g. “CAN” or “ALL”), which turns the results into clown data.

Question for the hive mind:
	•	Has anyone here built/used a tool like this?
	•	Any tricks for capturing mentions without requiring the $ sign, but without false positives?
	•	Do you guys even think tracking reddit sentiment is useful, or is it just vibes and memes?

I took a break, then used some money I had saved up to try again. That’s when I found TJR’s bootcamp, which pulled me into futures trading. Through him, I learned about prop firms.

I’ve blown probably 40 accounts and lost thousands of dollars. My turning point was when I stopped trying to learn every little thing about trading — whether it was on TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube. I cut all of it out and just stuck to one model (still TJR’s trading model), just with a different form of entry and a slightly different way of viewing it.

Once I cut the noise out and focused on one model, I was able to turn profitable and pass accounts easily.

The only tips I have are: FIND A MENTOR AND STICK TO IT. And find a community or someone who can hold you accountable for your actions. Once you master your strategy — whatever it may be — it’s all about psychology.

Recently, I have realised that I have got everything in line psychology, risk management, time frame to trade on, journalling, etc. One bottleneck, since a long time has been no confidence in my strategy, to earn 50% win rate. Brief background, I am an intraday trader, trade with 15mins candles, in the Indian stock market. I have expectation to have a 50% win rate and a 1:2RR. I am also mentally strong enough to bare the DD and I accept the loss as it is nothing but the trade went on the other side of the probability and accept that won or loss in this is not in my control but, over a period of time, I will have a decent win rate. 

The problem: 
I have tried a lot of times to understand that price and patterns are formed by market participants psychology and tried to make sense of it but, I can't logically accept the fact that traders and investors are looking at the trendline and reacting at that level. I firmly believe that whatever actions they are taking is based on the new update about that company or generally which led them to make the decision. Traders takes the action with or after an investor has made his action to a update. I believe that in the past if people sold the stock at 100, doesn't mean this time also they will sell at 100. this makes no sense to me. I have worked at an investment firm and investors don't make decisions based on the levels. In short, I don't believe past traders and investors actions will have any influence on the current or future actions but a new update will. My edge will come from me reacting on that update first and then other people reacting will shoot the price up and I will make money. But, here also I am not sure if I will have a 50% prob or not and just not sure what to do. I do believe in swings and keep at stops at the swing lows.

I thought the secret was finding the perfect strategy, but the biggest breakthroughs came when I simplified. Direction is more important then a perfect entry.

For me, that meant sticking to just a couple of setups I actually understood, keeping my position sizes realistic, and writing down every trade (with notes on what I was thinking). Journaling ended up teaching me more about my bad habits than any “mentor” or indicator ever did.

Once I learned to just focus on my plan, things got a lot calmer. It became boring but that's what made the difference.

1nj47mb,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 01:03:31,😌 Stoic Secrets for Trading Success,"Markets test patience, discipline, and resilience every single day. Stoicism, a philosophy built on clarity and self-mastery, offers traders tools to survive volatility and avoid self-destruction.

Here are ten principles worth living by:

🟡 Focus on what you can control

You can’t control the market, the news cycle, or other traders. You can control your research, your risk management, and your execution. Anchor yourself there.

🟡 Cultivate a growth mindset

Losses aren’t failure, they’re tuition. Keep a journal, extract lessons, and adapt. Each trade becomes a step forward.

🟡 Practice self-discipline

Stick to your plan when emotions flare. Review rules daily, set clear intentions, and don’t let fear or greed dictate entries.

🟡 Embrace discomfort

Volatility, new assets, losing trades - they all sharpen you. Lean into what feels uncomfortable, it expands your skillset.

🟡 Live with purpose and integrity

Trading for money alone leads to reckless choices. Define your deeper “why” and align your actions with it.

🟡 Build resilience

One bad week doesn’t end a career. Detach self-worth from outcomes, learn, reset, and stay in the game.

🟡 Practice gratitude

Gratitude keeps perspective. Wins, losses, even the chance to trade at all - acknowledge them. It strengthens mindset.

🟡 Self-reflection

Review your trades, but also your emotions. Awareness of your own patterns is often the biggest edge.

🟡 Cultivate strong relationships

Even in a solitary craft, community matters. Mentors, peers, and trading circles expand perspective and keep you grounded.

🟡 Focus on long-term goals

Day-to-day noise is a distraction. Sustainable trading comes from compounding disciplined decisions over years, not chasing every quick win.

Trading is more than charts and setups. It’s a battle with yourself. Stoic principles won’t make you rich overnight, but they’ll keep you standing long enough to let skill and discipline pay off.

Whales obviously benefit the most since it’s based on volume, but even smaller traders can still collect rewards if they stick with it.

1nik9y3,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 11:14:20,"5 years of trading, my best tips","I’ve been day trading full-time for about 5 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up accounts, had winning streaks, and gone through phases where I thought I finally “figured it out” only to get humbled the next week. If you’re just getting into this, I’ll save you a lot of pain by sharing the biggest lessons I wish someone drilled into me early on.

1. Risk management is everything.

This is the hill most beginners die on. It doesn’t matter how good your strategy looks, how many indicators you stack on your chart, or how many “conviction trades” you think you’ve found... if you don’t have strict risk rules, the market will clean you out. Always know your max risk per trade. For most people, that’s around 1–2% of your account balance. It sounds boring, but it’s the only thing that keeps you alive long enough to actually learn.

The temptation to “average down” or hold losers is massive when you’re new. You’ll convince yourself that a stock “has to bounce” or “can’t go any lower,” and then watch it tank another 10%. Every trader who’s lasted has their scars from ignoring stop losses. Treat capital like ammo; you only get so much of it, and wasting it on stubbornness will take you out of the game fast.

2. Don’t overtrade.

One of the biggest mistakes I see (and made myself) is thinking you need to be in a trade all the time. The reality is most of the market is just noise. The edge comes from waiting for the handful of clean setups each week that actually make sense. Some of my best months have come from taking fewer than 20 trades total.

It feels counterintuitive at first. You think, “If I’m not in a trade, I’m not making money.” But that’s backwards. By forcing trades, you’re just paying commissions, racking up losses, and burning mental energy. A huge skill in day trading is learning to sit on your hands until your setup appears. That patience is where consistency comes from.

3. Journaling changes the game.

I used to think journaling was pointless. Then I realized most of my losing trades weren’t about the strategy at all; they were about me. When you actually write down why you entered, why you exited, and what you were feeling at the time, patterns start to appear. You might notice you revenge trade after a loss, or that you take bad setups when you’re bored.

Your trading journal becomes your mirror. It forces you to face the truth instead of lying to yourself with hindsight. Over time, it’s less about “what did the chart do” and more about “why did I react this way.” That self-awareness is where growth happens, and without it, you’ll keep repeating the same mistakes.

4. Keep your setup simple.

When you’re new, you want to believe the answer is some secret indicator or complex strategy nobody else knows. So you start stacking indicators until your chart looks like Times Square. I went through that phase too. But after years of testing, I came back to the basics: clean price action, volume, and maybe one or two moving averages. That’s it.

The market isn’t hiding anything from you. Overcomplication just creates decision paralysis. The pros aren’t out here with 15 indicators... they’re reading levels, momentum, and supply/demand zones. Keep your charts clean, focus on setups you can repeat, and you’ll save yourself years of frustration.

5. Protect your mental health.

Trading will wreck you if you let it. If you’re risking rent money or grocery money, you’re trading scared, and scared traders make terrible decisions. You’ll cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and constantly feel like your back’s against the wall. That’s not trading, that’s gambling under pressure.

Detach yourself from the outcome of any single trade. This is easier said than done, but the only way to do it is by trading money you can afford to lose and keeping size small until you’re consistent. If a red day ruins your mood for 24 hours, you’re too emotionally tied to your positions. Protect your headspace first; the money follows when you’re calm.

6. Learn from screen time, not YouTube gurus.

There’s a ton of content online, but no video or course will replace actually watching the market tick by tick. You need screen time to understand how price moves, how news impacts volatility, and how momentum builds and fades. That “intuition” you see in experienced traders doesn’t come from books, it comes from thousands of hours watching patterns unfold live.

Don’t get me wrong, you can pick up useful basics from videos. But the real learning happens when you put skin in the game, track your trades, and experience the emotions firsthand. Nobody can teach you how you react to fear and greed, that’s something only screen time reveals.

7. Consistency > home runs.

The biggest misconception beginners have is thinking they need a massive trade to “make it.” They see screenshots of 10k days on Twitter and start chasing jackpots. The truth is, most accounts blow up because people swing for the fences. Survival in this game comes from small, consistent wins while keeping losses tiny.

A steady $100 a day, compounded, crushes the guy who tries to make $1,000 in one shot and wipes half his account. The math is simple, but the ego makes it hard to follow. Focus on consistency, build confidence, and scale later. Day trading is a marathon of small edges, not a lottery ticket.

Bottom line.

Day trading isn’t easy. Most people fail not because they can’t read charts, but because they underestimate how much discipline, patience, and emotional control it really takes. If you treat this like a craft instead of a get-rich-quick scheme, you’ll give yourself a real shot.

I really like this community so plan on doing more write-ups like these as a mini education series. If you guys want, my next one can be about 

A) The biggest mistakes I made in my first year of day trading (so you don’t have to)

B) What a ‘normal’ day actually looks like as a full-time day trader

C) Why 90% of traders quit in under 2 years (and how not to be one of them)

1nihpm1,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 09:36:43,Consistency Turns Losses Into Opportunities,"When I first started trading, I was losing more often than winning. My own family would laugh at me, saying I was just wasting my time staring at charts all day. It was tough, but I didn’t quit. I kept learning, adjusted my mistakes, and slowly built discipline.

Fast forward to today, some of those same family members who once laughed now ask me for financial help. That’s when I realized, losses were never failures, they were lessons. Every trader starts rough, but the key is staying consistent and growing through it.

That’s also why I look forward to things like the Onchain Trading Competition. Bitget recently raised the reward pool to 300 BGB (up from 200), and this round features $AVNT, $USELESS, and $TRADOOR. I’ve been trading $AVNT actively, especially with how its price has been moving lately, and the comp adds an extra layer of motivation.

I even received some $BGB rewards from the last Onchain Competition 52, so I’m jumping back in again. For me, it’s not just about the prizes, it’s about proving that the discipline I built during those tough early days is exactly what allows me to take advantage of opportunities like this now.

1nih0vb,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 09:08:53,"Trading Memecoins Taught Me Discipline, Not Just Hype","Memecoins move fast, but for me, trading them has been less about chasing pumps and more about understanding how quickly narratives shift in the market.

When I first started looking at them, I thought it was all about timing the moonshot. The reality is, most of the time the big moves happen before you even hear about them. I learned that the hard way, jumping in late and watching positions reverse almost immediately. It was frustrating, but it also taught me a valuable lesson: don’t just follow hype, focus on risk management and execution.

Over time, I realized memecoins aren’t really about fundamentals but about sentiment, community energy, and speed. Once I accepted that, I stopped expecting them to behave like other assets and started treating them as high-volatility trades that require discipline.

Recently, I have been trading some of the newer tokens like $KOGE, $CARDS, and $TROLL, and I have been keeping myself engaged through structured challenges. One example is the Bitget Onchain Challenge Phase 18, which has a 100,000 BGB reward pool tied to trading activity. For me, it’s less about the rewards and more about having a system that keeps me consistent, accountable, and focused on the process rather than the quick wins.

That shift in mindset has made all the difference.

Do you guys actually keep a trading journal? Like, do you track setups, screenshots, your emotions during the trade, or just the numbers? How often do you go back and review it, and how do you make sure it actually helps instead of feeling like busy work?

Also curious if you stick to a simple spreadsheet, fancy software, or just pen and paper, what actually works in practice? I feel like the more I read about journaling, the more I realize it’s one of those things everyone says is crucial, but no one really explains *how* to do it well.

The chart is making clear lower lows while the TSI at the bottom is making higher lows. At the same time, price was right around the 200ma, which is just an extra confirmation that I look for especially if price seems like it’s bouncing there.

These setups are some of the best you can look for while day trading the indices or large cap stocks, and I’ll stand by that statement.

1nhwks9,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 16:06:35,Why you probably should STOP NOW if you’re thinking of getting into trading,"I had everything going for me in life. But I decided what I had wasn’t paying me fast enough and I started pouring myself into trading, hoping to escape the matrix.

Fast forward 6 years, and I basically was back to even after the trump tariff scare. I knew I had to quit and I walked away.

Trading taught me basically no hard skills that were transferable to any other field.

It made me a worse person in so many ways.

It isolated me from society and people who love and care about me. It did nothing to help my social skills. It made it harder for me to stay in shape physically and eat healthily. It added insane levels of stress that I sometimes tried to eliminate in less than healthy ways.

I am grateful that God gave me another chance and I now have professional success outside the markets that came from applying myself to my field of study in school, with networking, mentorship and investment in my real business outside the markets.

In the unlikely event you do better than I did, you’re still contributing nothing to society. People will respect you less than a door to door home improvement salesman. And for good reason - society wouldn’t function if we were all trying to trade for a living. Ain’t no woman out there want to introduce her boyfriend or husband to her friends and have to tell them he trades for a living. If you so much as buy a pickup truck and start a junk hauling business, that’s better evidence of you making money than claiming you’re a trader.

Please for the love of all that’s good, don’t throw away some of the best years of your life like I did. If you’re convinced, I can’t stop you, but if you’re even marginally on the fence, please at least take some time before trying to get into this. Ask your friends and family what they honestly think, and listen to them.

Sometimes I got it right, and it felt good, but other times it left me frustrated because the market doesn’t care about perfection. I think i have caught the spot, then watch the chart and realize there are a lot of things to reconsider. That constant chase can eat away at the joy of trading if you let it.

I felt that a lot with so many tokens $CUDIS, $USDUC etc. I wasn’t super early on them, and it bothered me at first. I thought I had lost it all, but it didn’t feel that way when I saw the volume building after I was already in. Later on, it clicked. curiosity made be  look deeper to the extent i realized people were rushing into the tokens from bitget because they are part of the required set in the phase 53 onchain trading competition. That changed the angle for me. It wasn’t about me being late now, it was about understanding why the demand suddenly stacked up and how competitions like this shape short term sentiment.

That realization made me take a step back. Instead of beating myself up about not being first, I started asking what comes after timing. Position sizing, discipline, patience, and a better deep research, those things matter more than catching the very bottom. Anyone can jump in, but it’s happened once you’re in that separates random luck from real structure. Timing can give you a head start, but focus keeps you in the race.

So now my mindset is shifting. I still care about entries, but I’m not letting them define my whole trade. I want to build habits around how I handle and research on market movements, because the market keeps proving it’s not only about who shows up first, it’s about who knows how to move when the crowd finally arrives.",3,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nhrbh0/learning_to_look_beyond_timing_in_trading/,new,Discussion,1.0

On the other hand, we’re still facing sticky inflation risks, Tariffs are adding pressure, oil isn’t exactly helping, and the Fed has been crystal clear that they don’t want to repeat the mistakes of cutting too early.

1nhh84q,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 05:31:38,Prop Firm Wants My MQL5 Source Code—Is This Normal?,"Hey everyone,

I've been in the software development field for over six years and have recently come across prop firms as a new way to apply my trading strategies.

I decided to start a free trial with a firm, and when I asked about their rules, I received a couple of emails.

First, their support team sent an email (see screenshot 1) saying they would enable my EA if I provided the `.EX5` and `.MQL5` files along with my account number. This immediately raised a huge red flag for me, as providing the `.MQL5` file means giving them the full source code for my strategy.

I then sent them a follow-up email explaining my setup, which is a Python bot communicating with MT5. They responded by saying they don't allow any external APIs or socket communication and that the EA must run solely within the MT5 platform. They also mentioned they've disabled all external API and socket webhook communication (see screenshot 2).

I'm trying to figure out if this is normal for the industry. My main questions for this community are:

1. **Is this a standard practice for prop firms?** Do most of them require you to submit your `.MQL5` (source code) file for review?
2. **Is it a red flag that they're asking for the** `.MQL5` **file?** It feels like I'd be giving away my entire strategy. What are the risks of doing this?
3. Do you know of any reputable prop firms that **don't** require you to hand over your source code files?

Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Fubo’s stock has already been climbing hard the past month, but if this deal actually happens → you’re looking at a streaming beast:

	•	Disney+ + Hulu + ESPN combined with Fubo’s live sports = unmatched bundle 📺

	•	Could pressure $NFLX hard, finally forcing them to give up market share

	•	$WBD + $PSKY are also rumored to be circling other deals → the whole space is heating up

If $DIS throws real cash at this, $FUBO valuation could rerate overnight. Traders calling it one of the biggest potential shakeups in streaming.

What do you guys think? Is $FUBO the sleeper play of the year or another buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news trap?

1nh278g,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 16:38:04,Swing Trading in the Stock Market is Real!,"I wanted to share my experience with swing trading to show that it’s possible to build real wealth through it, even if it’s not easy. I’ve been at it for a few years now, and the results speak for themselves.


In 2023 and 2024, I averaged about 30% returns per year using a local broker. Their analytics were pretty basic—no fancy calendar views—so I can’t share screenshots from back then. 

But starting this year, I switched to Moomoo for better tools and tracking. As of this month (September 2025), I’m up around 130% YTD (refer 1st attachment). Pretty wild, right?


On top of that, I manage a family fund that’s also hit almost 30% gains, and we’ve already made some withdrawals without derailing the growth. (Refer 2nd and 3rd attachment)

A quick note: I always talk in percentages because that’s what keeps me focused and disciplined. Whenever I shift my mindset to dollar amounts, my trades start going sideways—it’s like the greed creeps in and clouds my judgment.


For anyone looking to build wealth through stock market trading, here’s my honest advice based on what I’ve learned:

1. It’s possible, but extremely difficult. Expect setbacks, and be ready to put in the work.

2. Learn as much as you can to build your own system—don’t overwhelm yourself with conflicting info. Focus on what resonates and test it.

3. You make the strategy; don’t let the strategy control you. Adapt it to your style, not the other way around.

4. Self-discovery is a big part of the game. Trading reveals your risk tolerance, emotions, and biases—use that to your advantage.

5. What works for others might not work for you. Experiment, track results, and refine relentlessly.


Just remember, this isn’t financial advice—do your own research.

1ngw28u,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 12:40:40,Why does it take many years to become profitable with trading?,"Hi traders. Im still quite new to trading (trading for only 6 months now). And before i get into this question, I am not claiming to be profitable or nearly there yet, I just wanna know what it takes.

Why does it take most people 3+ years to be profitable when trading is said to be better when it is simplified? In my eyes, the main things you need to be successful are: 

\- A strategy that has been extensively backtested that is proven to work

\- Good risk management

\- The psychological aspect of trading where you objectively follows the rules of your trading plan and not let your emotions impact how you execute and manage trades.

The way i see it: finding a working strategy with good risk management shouldnt take too long if you have enough time. A strategy can be backtested over 12 months within 2 days of being on fxreplay. so theoretically if you have time to you could backtest around 10 strategy variations a month. Forward testing can happen as time goes by.

I understand for some the psychology aspect may take a while to master, but lets say that someone has little emotional decision making from the start and has a vast understanding that trading involves losing as well, you just need a good RR, even though your win rate is less than 50%.

  
Taking into account all the above, I dont see why it cant take someone about a year to become profitable?

am I missing something important? it just doesnt seem that complicated to me.",101,185,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ngw28u/why_does_it_take_many_years_to_become_profitable/,new,Discussion,0.89

1ngtif3,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 11:01:19,Back testing trading view,"Hi everyone,
I’m still learning and quite new to backtesting, so I’d like to ask how you usually do it on TradingView.
	•	Do you use a split screen with two charts (for example one on Daily and the other on lower timeframes)?
→ And if you do it this way, can you go from Daily all the way down to the 1-minute chart without problems?
	•	Or do you prefer to backtest using just one chart and switch timeframes as you go?

I’ve tried starting from the Daily and then moving down to the 1-minute, which works fine. But when I go the other way around (from lower TF back to higher), TradingView shows me the future candles and that ruins the replay. For my backtesting I really need to move from lower to higher TF to check the overall context without spoiling it.

Do you have any tips or better methods for handling this?

Thanks in advance!

I have a win rate of 48,7% with an average win of 15,77% and average loss of 3,64% (6% expectancy) Every trade I take goes through a tight screening process, after of which I do my manual research on the fundamentals and then use some technical analysis on the entry.

I've felt extremely confident in every trade I've taken because I finally feel like I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. (this was not the case when I was experimenting with day trading).

The only problem is I only have 40 trades taken. I take about 3-5 trades a month and I hold for about 2-5 weeks. Can I feel confident or is there a high chance that this is just some lucky streak.

But i went ahead and observed what my cousin did for a month and IT WAS LEGIT AF, 
I discussed it with my dad, long story short we invested 10 lakh pkr into it (atleast 3000$ is minimum, but 5000$ is safe it prevents tension of liquidation) 
And we are trading in USDCAD, all it requires is a basic knowledge of how the trades work, and just a lot of patience, the bot is designed to wait till the total trade goes +ve to cutt off all the trades, it takes trades on its own sometimes sell sometimes buy and holds it, and Alhamdulillah it makes around 300$ smth a week, half of which goes to the company like 150$, and the rest is ours
I have helped a friend get into this business as well and we are doing pretty good,

While my charts may seem confusing at first glance, there are resources on my personal channel explaining my system and how to trade it.

For here though, I will keep it simple and highlight potential key areas and levels for the coming week.

Red 1M and Orange 1W chart:

Bulls still fully in control at the top of the structure breaking above the 1M overextension zone, the 1W overextension zone now rests at 6690 for the coming week.

Yellow 1D and Green 4H chart:

Finding support here in the entry zone of the Yellow 1D bull structure with lots of pin reversals in this area the last few weeks showing buyers stepping in.

The confluence around 6690 for the FOMC date I mentioned last week is very much in play.  We also have a confluence of support down at 6405 that could come into play to the downside.

As I mentioned previously, any time there is a confluence like this around an important news event I will pay particular attention too it.

I also mentioned last week, the ability to identify a future time and price point makes for a lucrative opportunity using Options.  

Being that we have both a long and short confluence and the impending news event, makes a perfect opportunity for an OTM straddle near our targets.  

I may do a separate forward test entirely around option strategies after the conclusion of this one if there is any interest.


Blue 1H and Purple 15m chart:

We are nearing overextension on the bull structure of both timeframes.  For this reason I am switching to a near term short bias into FOMC, and even after if we do get a blowoff into overextension and a new ATH ZI still expect a sizable sell off to follow.

Holding some shorts on the intraday account from the 6600 level which I should be out of before the announcement on Wednesday.

In the near term would look to re-enter long around the 6515 level stop outside of structure at 6465 targeting ATH 6615 R:R 2",1,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngm29g,new,Technical analysis,1.0

Bulls still fully in control at the top of the chart, pushing deeper into overextension on both timeframes toward that 4000 hyperextension level.

Yellow 1D and Green 4H chart:

Pushing deeper into overextension now on the 1D and deep in hyperextension on the 4H.

Our short bias kept us profitable all week with some nice sell offs from what is now appearing to be a local ceiling around the 3700 level.

If this level tests again I would guess we break toward a new ATH, but for a long I am still waiting on a deeper selloff to the 3600 area.  

Realistically I would like for us to test deeper to 3450 but I will have switched my bias back long way before then.

Blue 1H and Purple 15m chart:

We've fallen back into no mans land on the Blue 1H bull structure, we have some new Purple 15 bear structure developing again would not look to it for short entries more of a target/overextension structure.

I do have an upward bias but a clean break of the structure would definitely bring the 59 level in play by the end of the week as this area has been tested through several times now.

Now, I dabble in stocks a little — nothing crazy, just holding some Ethereum and throwing a hail mary on SBET. I wasn’t about to tell this old man my “get rich or die trying” strategy, but I figured hey, he used to work on Wall Street, maybe I’ll pick his brain.

So I ask him: “What would you recommend?”

“I was a long-term investor. Mostly defense stocks.”

Solid. Reasonable. Grandpa Buffett vibes. 
Which sounded pretty legit. But then he suddenly switches gears and tells me:

“Short everything. Short the whole market. Short everything.”

Bro. WHAT??

I’m standing there like, “Are you trying to make me a billionaire or bankrupt me in a week?” And he just shrugs and goes:

“Eh… either or.”

1m1v2h7,2025-07-16,2025-07-16 21:50:44,Notes From a Multimillionaire Trader,"Long-term investing can dwarf what you make from trading. Know what you can trade, and what you mustn’t trade (PLTR).

Trading for a living still feels like an ordinary job. 

As I come tantalizingly close to $4 million, I don’t feel any different than when I had $1 million, or $500,000. I don’t live any differently. I don’t spend any more money. I'm not any happier.

There are only one or two brief periods in an entire year that are suitable for trading. Sometimes there are none. Unsuccessful traders tend to press as many buttons as possible as often as possible. Successful traders trade very reluctantly. 

Learn to read SPY, QQQ, and market internals. Then, and only then, find a stock showing (true, not imaginary) relative strength. Compare lots of them. Focus on market leaders. 

If something keeps working, keep doing it. If it becomes much harder, pay attention and get ready to stop. Know when to deploy another strategy. 

All long call strategies are dangerous. Leveraged long call strategies are dumb. Highly ITM long call strategies can be smart, in the (infrequent) right market conditions. 

Patience pays. 

Traders who ask whether you can trade for a living don’t have enough capital to do it, so, no. Those who can are already rich. And those who are rich usually have other things they want to do. 

Stop with the YouTube fantasies, get a real job, and save everything for about twenty years, like I did. It takes money to make money, and you need to make that money from somewhere. 

Don’t lie to and try to rip other people off with false promises. Stop with the $200/month Deecord scams. 

Trade fundamentally strong companies. Learn about trends and ranges. All you really need is Adam Grimes’s book, The Art and Science of Technical Analysis, and a lot of practice. 

Be someone’s best friend. Make yourself useful. Create good karma. Teach others for free. 

Go where you’re treated best. 

True wealth is what’s left when all of the money gets taken away. 

Happy Adventures,

1judegz,2025-04-08,2025-04-08 09:20:59,How I used ChatGPT to make 7.2k,"I’ve been seeing loads of people talking about using AI to trade on tiktok and few people posting about it here on reddit so figured I'd give it a try as well.

Holy shit.

I didn't put too much thought into this originally I just instructed ChatGPT to analyze price action.. mainly to spot market sentiment based on the news, support/resistance levels. Then I asked it to generate a trade plan with entry points, stop losses, and take profits all while spamming it with chart screenshots throughout the day…

I played around with a lot with prompts but the prompt used in the context of this post is:

“I need a structured trading analysis for (ETH) based on the latest 4H and 1D chart screenshots. The analysis must include: 

1, Market Sentiment & News Interpretation:

Search for relevant news regarding Ethereum and summarize its impact (bullish, bearish, or neutral). If no relevant news is found, state 'no relevant news’ 

2. Technical Analysis: • Identify the current trend based on price action, volume, and the 200 SMA. • Highlight key support and resistance levels that influence price movement. • Assess RSI for potential overbought/oversold conditions. • Identify if Ethereum is breaking above/below moving averages and what that implies. 

3. Trade Setup: Based on analysis, suggest either a long or short position, and provide the following: • Entry Price • Stop Loss (STPL) level • Take Profit (TP) Levels • DCA Strategy: • Define price levels to add to a losing position (increasing size according to risk management). DCA levels must reflect volatility index for the underlying asset. Higher volatility more spread between DCA levels. • Define price levels to add to a winning position when in profit. \* Return previous information in a well organized table chart structure. 

4. Position Sizing for a $20,000 Portfolio: • Ensure a maximum risk of 10% per trade. (This is high risk) • Use 20x leverage to determine asset quantity in contracts (not dollar value). • Maintain a structured risk-reward ratio with clear position size increments. \* position size must be in dollar amount needed to open the trade and also in the underlying assets quantity. (Example 10ETH, ""x"" amount of $) 

5. Alternative Hedge Strategy: • If the primary trade setup fails, suggest a well-structured hedge trade in the opposite direction with DCA, STPL, TP levels, and position”

(And yes I did also use ChatGPT to make the prompt lol)

It even suggested hedging with shorts at the top so by the time the peak hit I was already scaling into shorts. Ended up racking in $7,266.04 in profit from 1 ChatGPT conversation.

Insane.

I don’t know how many traders are doing this already and just gatekeeping it but this genuinely could change trading. 

Edit: Quick update. I now done this 4 times. 3 of the 4 were profitable sessions but none as profitable as the original post. I've also noticed that some other AI's work better then ChatGPT for this.

1l8d4gw,2025-06-10,2025-06-10 19:00:00,Your Brain is Programmed to Lose Money in Trading,"**TL;DR: Academic studies prove psychological biases kill more accounts than bad strategies. Here's the science behind why your mind sabotages your trades.**

I'm about to explain why most of us will fail at trading, and it has nothing to do with our indicators or ""edge.""

# The 3 Brain Glitches That Murder Accounts

# 1. The Disposition Effect

**What it is:** You naturally hold losers too long and sell winners too fast.

**Real example:**

* AAPL drops 5% → ""It'll come back, I'll hold""
* AAPL gains 3% → ""Better take profits before it reverses""

**The brutal data:** Traders sell winners **50% more often** than losers. This single bias destroys more accounts than any strategy flaw.

**Why your brain does this:** Losses hurt 2.5x more than equivalent gains feel good (loss aversion). Your brain tricks you into avoiding the ""pain"" of realizing losses.

# 2. Confirmation Bias (The Echo Chamber)

**What happens:** You only see information that confirms your trades.

**The research:**

* Traders give **50% more weight** to confirming opinions
* Click on news that supports positions **85% of the time**
* Ignore stronger contradictory evidence

**Real behavior:** Long on Bitcoin? You'll find 10 bullish articles and ignore the bearish ones.

# 3. Overconfidence + Self-Attribution

**The cycle:**

* Win = ""I'm skilled""
* Loss = ""Bad luck/manipulation""

**Barber & Odean's study:** Overconfident traders achieve **inferior returns** and trade excessively, racking up fees.

# The Data That Should Terrify You

**Brazil:** 97% of day traders who persisted 300+ days lost money  
**Taiwan:** Only 1% of day traders profitable after fees  
**The kicker:** These failures weren't from bad strategies - they were **behavioral patterns that never changed**

# The Beginner's Luck Death Trap

Here's how most accounts die:

1. **Early random wins** create false confidence
2. **Position sizes increase** (""I've got this figured out"")
3. **Risk tolerance grows** (start gambling)
4. **Reality hits** with devastating losses
5. **Account blown** within 6 months

Sound familiar?

# The Brutal Self-Assessment

Answer honestly:

✅ Do you increase position size after wins?  
✅ Hold losers longer than winners?  
✅ Make revenge trades after losses?  
✅ Check positions obsessively?  
✅ Blame losses on ""manipulation""?

**If you answered yes to ANY of these, psychology is killing your account.**

# What Actually Works (Institutional Methods)

# Phase 1: Awareness

* **Trade journal:** Record emotional state for every trade
* **Track deviations:** Note when you break your rules
* **Loss analysis:** Review WHY you held losers too long

# Phase 2: Systematic Defense

* **Mechanical position sizing:** No discretion allowed
* **Automatic stops:** Set and forget, no moving
* **Checklists:** Remove emotion from entries/exits

# Phase 3: Professional Mindset

* **Process over profit:** Judge yourself on following rules
* **Losses are expenses:** Cost of doing business
* **Probabilities, not predictions:** Think in long-term edge

# The Professional Difference

**Retail traders:** ""This trade will make me rich""  
**Professionals:** ""This is trade #1,247 of my career""

**Retail:** Emotional roller coaster with every position  
**Professionals:** Treat trading like running a business

# The Bottom Line

**Your brain evolved for survival, not trading profits.** Every instinct that kept your ancestors alive will bankrupt your account.

The 3% who succeed don't have better strategies - they have better psychological discipline.

**Discussion:** Which bias hits you hardest? How many of you actually journal your emotional state during trades?

Since January 20, he’s been outright *neglecting* the company. Meanwhile, Tesla stock is tanking, its EV market share is shrinking, and competitors are eating its lunch.

Let’s be real—Musk isn’t running Tesla. He’s a *fake* CEO, barely even pretending to do the job while juggling **five** other companies: SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, X Corp, and xAI. Half his time is spent playing politics in the US and other European governments all while Tesla investors watch their money burn.

How much longer are people going to put up with this? If Musk doesn’t want to lead Tesla, he shouldn’t be rewarded for it. Not with a dime, and sure as hell not with $58 billion. Tesla needs real leadership, not a part-time clown who drops in whenever he feels like it.

It should send a message when Europe's second largest pension fund, APB, sells its entire $585 million stake in Tesla over Musks unjustifiable and unearned billion-dollar pay package.

The board needs to wake up and cut him loose *before* he tanks the company completely. Enough is enough. Either he **st**eps up and actually acts like a real CEO, or he needs to get the hell out and make way for someone who actually care about the company. Until then, he shouldn’t be crying to the courts about not getting his $58 billion payday. He hasn’t earned it.

Hey folks,
I’m in my early 40s now, been trading for about 9 years. Not a guru, not rich, just someone who’s seen enough wins and (plenty of) losses to have a few scars and a few insights. Trading strategies are brutal teachers, but the lessons stick – both in the markets and in life.

Here are 8 of them, structured with a little mnemonic 

Every plan fails without discipline – The setup matters less than the discipline to follow it.

Accept losses quickly – Cutting early hurts less than watching them balloon.

Time in the market beats timing the market – both for trades and for personal growth.

Money is just a tool – Don’t tie your self-worth to your P&L.

Your ego is your worst enemy – Pride makes you hold bags longer than logic.

Adapting is survival – Markets shift, life shifts; rigidity kills accounts and opportunities.

Systems over emotions – If your rules aren’t stronger than your feelings, you’ll bleed.

St happens – Black swans, flash crashes, fat fingers. Build resilience, not excuses.

1nik9y3,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 11:14:20,"5 years of trading, my best tips","I’ve been day trading full-time for about 5 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up accounts, had winning streaks, and gone through phases where I thought I finally “figured it out” only to get humbled the next week. If you’re just getting into this, I’ll save you a lot of pain by sharing the biggest lessons I wish someone drilled into me early on.

1. Risk management is everything.

This is the hill most beginners die on. It doesn’t matter how good your strategy looks, how many indicators you stack on your chart, or how many “conviction trades” you think you’ve found... if you don’t have strict risk rules, the market will clean you out. Always know your max risk per trade. For most people, that’s around 1–2% of your account balance. It sounds boring, but it’s the only thing that keeps you alive long enough to actually learn.

The temptation to “average down” or hold losers is massive when you’re new. You’ll convince yourself that a stock “has to bounce” or “can’t go any lower,” and then watch it tank another 10%. Every trader who’s lasted has their scars from ignoring stop losses. Treat capital like ammo; you only get so much of it, and wasting it on stubbornness will take you out of the game fast.

2. Don’t overtrade.

One of the biggest mistakes I see (and made myself) is thinking you need to be in a trade all the time. The reality is most of the market is just noise. The edge comes from waiting for the handful of clean setups each week that actually make sense. Some of my best months have come from taking fewer than 20 trades total.

It feels counterintuitive at first. You think, “If I’m not in a trade, I’m not making money.” But that’s backwards. By forcing trades, you’re just paying commissions, racking up losses, and burning mental energy. A huge skill in day trading is learning to sit on your hands until your setup appears. That patience is where consistency comes from.

3. Journaling changes the game.

I used to think journaling was pointless. Then I realized most of my losing trades weren’t about the strategy at all; they were about me. When you actually write down why you entered, why you exited, and what you were feeling at the time, patterns start to appear. You might notice you revenge trade after a loss, or that you take bad setups when you’re bored.

Your trading journal becomes your mirror. It forces you to face the truth instead of lying to yourself with hindsight. Over time, it’s less about “what did the chart do” and more about “why did I react this way.” That self-awareness is where growth happens, and without it, you’ll keep repeating the same mistakes.

4. Keep your setup simple.

When you’re new, you want to believe the answer is some secret indicator or complex strategy nobody else knows. So you start stacking indicators until your chart looks like Times Square. I went through that phase too. But after years of testing, I came back to the basics: clean price action, volume, and maybe one or two moving averages. That’s it.

The market isn’t hiding anything from you. Overcomplication just creates decision paralysis. The pros aren’t out here with 15 indicators... they’re reading levels, momentum, and supply/demand zones. Keep your charts clean, focus on setups you can repeat, and you’ll save yourself years of frustration.

5. Protect your mental health.

Trading will wreck you if you let it. If you’re risking rent money or grocery money, you’re trading scared, and scared traders make terrible decisions. You’ll cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and constantly feel like your back’s against the wall. That’s not trading, that’s gambling under pressure.

Detach yourself from the outcome of any single trade. This is easier said than done, but the only way to do it is by trading money you can afford to lose and keeping size small until you’re consistent. If a red day ruins your mood for 24 hours, you’re too emotionally tied to your positions. Protect your headspace first; the money follows when you’re calm.

6. Learn from screen time, not YouTube gurus.

There’s a ton of content online, but no video or course will replace actually watching the market tick by tick. You need screen time to understand how price moves, how news impacts volatility, and how momentum builds and fades. That “intuition” you see in experienced traders doesn’t come from books, it comes from thousands of hours watching patterns unfold live.

Don’t get me wrong, you can pick up useful basics from videos. But the real learning happens when you put skin in the game, track your trades, and experience the emotions firsthand. Nobody can teach you how you react to fear and greed, that’s something only screen time reveals.

7. Consistency > home runs.

The biggest misconception beginners have is thinking they need a massive trade to “make it.” They see screenshots of 10k days on Twitter and start chasing jackpots. The truth is, most accounts blow up because people swing for the fences. Survival in this game comes from small, consistent wins while keeping losses tiny.

A steady $100 a day, compounded, crushes the guy who tries to make $1,000 in one shot and wipes half his account. The math is simple, but the ego makes it hard to follow. Focus on consistency, build confidence, and scale later. Day trading is a marathon of small edges, not a lottery ticket.

Bottom line.

Day trading isn’t easy. Most people fail not because they can’t read charts, but because they underestimate how much discipline, patience, and emotional control it really takes. If you treat this like a craft instead of a get-rich-quick scheme, you’ll give yourself a real shot.

I really like this community so plan on doing more write-ups like these as a mini education series. If you guys want, my next one can be about 

A) The biggest mistakes I made in my first year of day trading (so you don’t have to)

B) What a ‘normal’ day actually looks like as a full-time day trader

C) Why 90% of traders quit in under 2 years (and how not to be one of them)

I wish I had never met this guy. He introduced me to leverage trading which has made me so much money, but in the end left me with nothing.

I know how much daily effort, discipline, and knowledge it takes. And it makes me so mad when he acts like he’s a genius and everyone else is dumb, just because he’s been lucky.


I’ve even explained a lot of things to him, but he acts like this shit is simple and I’m overcomplicating it. Yeah it's simple when someone is explaining things in short to you. For me it wasn't fking easy. I had to stay and watch dozens of hours of ICT boring content to get where I am today. Honestly, it makes me feel disgusted. I somehow feel like he’s disrespecting the work and time I’ve put in.


Maybe I feel like this also because I'm still not profitable up to this day. I am overthinking every trade and even if I have the right setup often, I end up closing the trade with a small loss just because I am doubting myself.

1nos48l,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 16:15:49,3 years of trading: The brutal lessons I wish someone told me sooner,"I’ve been trading seriously for about 3 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up small accounts, overleveraged, revenge-traded, and gone through the cycle of overconfidence → humility → back to square one. I’m not a guru, I’m not here to sell you anything. I just want to share the lessons that actually stuck with me, because I wish I had internalized these from day one.

1. Risk management isn’t optional it’s survival

Everyone says “risk management matters” but you don’t really understand it until you blow up a few accounts. The truth is, you can have a 40–50% win rate and still be profitable if your winners are bigger than your losers. But if you don’t cap your risk per trade (1–2% of account size), you’re basically playing Russian roulette. One stubborn “this has to bounce” moment can erase months of progress.

2. The market doesn’t reward effort it rewards discipline

I used to believe that the harder I studied, the more setups I should be able to find. Wrong. Most days, there’s nothing worth trading. Some of my best weeks came from taking only 3–4 trades total. Sitting on your hands feels lazy at first, but the reality is: trading more doesn’t equal earning more. It usually equals bleeding more.

3. Overcomplication is a trap

In my first year, my charts looked like a Christmas tree: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci levels, you name it. I thought the “secret” was hidden in some magical indicator combination. After testing for months, I came back to basics: clean levels, volume, and price action. Most pros I’ve observed keep it shockingly simple because clutter breeds hesitation, and hesitation costs money.

4. Journaling turned me from “random clicking” into an actual trader

I resisted journaling for the longest time. Felt tedious. But when I finally did it, patterns jumped out: I overtraded after losses, I closed winners too early when I was scared, I took dumb setups when I was bored. None of that was visible on my P&L alone. Writing down the why behind each trade gave me brutal but necessary feedback.

5. Trading will expose your psychology faster than anything else

The market is the best mirror you’ll ever have. If you’re impatient in life, you’ll overtrade. If you’re stubborn, you’ll refuse to cut losers. If you’re greedy, you’ll size up too soon. I used to think trading was about charts now I know it’s mostly about emotional control. If you don’t fix your mindset, no strategy will save you.

6. You don’t need to “quit your job” to be a trader

This one took me a while. I used to idolize the idea of being a “full-time trader” with no other income. The truth ? Having a second income stream actually helps you trade better, because you’re not desperate for every single trade to pay your bills. Desperation makes you reckless. A job or side hustle gives you breathing room, which translates into better decisions.

7. Consistency > jackpots

My biggest trap was thinking I needed one massive trade to “make it.” The truth is, trading is about grinding out small, consistent gains while keeping losses tiny.

You can check it out in my [profile link](https://churningandburning.com/category/portrait-of-a-trader-series).

Here's my TL;DR version of it in this post.

2011-2014 -- Stephen (I nickname him Clockwork, for reasons you can read about) starts at a third rate prop firm in NYC. They don't pay any salary. There's a 90% drop out rate within one year as most traders struggle during this market. Stephen likes scalping but this era marks the rapid proliferation of HFT and scalping isn't what it used to be. He's consistently able to make $100/day but it gets eaten up by profit split, fees, and living expenses. He literally sits next to me and I teach him everything I know. Only able to break through in 2014 as he shifts to OTC trading, options, and small caps.

2015-2019 -- Stephen becomes a consistent 6-figure trader. He likes to short small caps and buy large market dips during 50+ VIX events. 2017, he surpases 1 mil annual for the first time.

2020-2021 -- pandemic market with market crash and recovery, followed by crazy bubble market in SPAC's, covid stocks, SAAS/tech, pump and dumps, crypto/NFT, Stephen enters 8-figure PnL territory.

2022-2023 -- easy money over, Stephen's PnL shrinks by 80%. he has to learn how to adapt

Trading isn't easy. There's a lot of bumps along the way, even for the very best. You have to keep a student's mindset--always humble, always learning, never thinking you have it all figured out. I think Stephen really embodies that mindset. He's not out there making bold calls and claiming to have a holy grail. He just likes to make money.

All the information is based off of interviewing him and asking for his statements. Anyway, check it out and let me know what you think.",729,157,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1icxesu/friend_of_mine_traded_for_10_years_went_from/,year,Resources,0.9
1nfobfw,2025-09-13,2025-09-13 00:32:17,I make a living with a 40-50% win rate,"I didn’t leave my 9-5 because I found a magic 80% win strategy. My journal shows 58.26% green days, a typical day wins bigger than it loses (avg daily win/loss 1.17), and I’m done in about 4h18m on average. Biggest up day: $5,387.50. Biggest down day: -$2,015.25.

*Processing img duzroav91vof1...*

Nothing glamorous, also note that still to this day, trading **is NOT** the only source of income I have, it is advised to have at least one more, for youre safety and sanity.

What I actually trade and how it performs:

ES: 40% win rate, $13,637.50 net, avg win $695.97 vs avg loss -$317.34 (\~2.2x payoff).

NQ: 52.11% win rate, $14,215 net, avg win $794.86 vs avg loss -$446.91 (\~1.8x payoff).

MES: 36.84% win rate, $917.50 net.

MNQ: 37.04% win rate, -$1,438.50 net (I cut it, noise for me).

RTY: 27.91% win rate, $1,960 net.

*Processing img j0q5ltv81vof1...*

The lesson: you don’t need a sky-high win rate if your average winner is meaningfully larger than your loser and you focus on the symbols that actually pay you.

My playbook is simple and strict. I trade a smart money concepts: wait for alignment (bias + structure), then pull the trigger only on A-setups. For index futures that means things like SMT between ES/NQ, reclaim through key levels, and clean breaks of strcuturee ofter a liquidity sweep. Early in a cycle I’ll size conservatively and let one or two quality trades build a buffer, then I protect that buffer like my paycheck. It’s boring but boring compounds.

If you’re trying to make the jump: track your real numbers, cut the instruments that drain you, and let the payoff ratio do the heavy lifting.

I’ve seen lots of similar questions in the group recently so maybe these thoughts will help if you’re considering getting started.

1. **Keep It simple:** It’s tempting to make things more complicated with tons of indicators and complex strategies, but I’ve found that simpler, clear-cut strategies tend to work better in the long run. It’s more about testing and refining than making everything overly complicated.
2. **Backtest but don’t rely too much on It:** Backtesting is important, but it’s not the whole picture. Past performance isn’t always a reliable predictor of future results. I’d recommend paper trading your algo in a real environment before going live as the market can behave a bit differently than what the backtest data shows.
3. **Risk management matters:** Even if your algo is well-built without proper risk management it can be tough to get through market swings. I always include stop-losses, position sizing, and other protective measures in my strategy.
4. **Watch out for overfitting:** A mistake I’ve made in the past is overfitting an algo to historical data. It’s important to make sure your model can adapt to live market conditions not just the past data it’s trained on. Regular monitoring and updates are key for this.
5. **Don’t forget about emotions:** Even though your algo runs automatically you can’t just “fire and forget” You still need to stay involved to monitor how things are going and make adjustments when needed. The market changes and so should your approach.
6. **Keep learning:** I’m constantly learning and trying to improve. Particularly from others in this group. Lots of good data sources and advice being shared for improving my methods—there’s always something new to discover and someone out there doing better.

**TL;DR:** Over the years, I’ve learned that simpler strategies often work best, backtesting is useful but not perfect, and risk management is crucial. Be careful not to overfit, stay involved with your algo, and always look to the advice of others for ways to improve.

What about you all? Any lessons or tips you’ve learned from your own experiences to share?

1m7v4ga,2025-07-24,2025-07-24 00:42:15,My exact daily routine as a full-time trader,"Most people only focus on what happens during the trading session.

But what I do before the market opens is what actually keeps me consistent.

Here’s the exact routine I follow every single morning:

**- 4:30 AM – Wake up (2 hours before the market opens)**

I don’t touch my phone. No emails. No charts. Just get vertical and get moving.

**- 4:35 AM – Cold shower**

Instant alertness. Forces presence. No better way to break sleep inertia.

**- 4:45 AM – 20 min walk or stretching session**

Gets the blood flowing. Movement before momentum. It clears mental fog better than any podcast.

**- 5:10 AM - 4-7-8 breathwork (10 cycles)**

Inhale for 4 seconds

Hold for 7 seconds

Exhale slowly for 8 seconds

There is 5-10min guided videos on YT

This activates the parasympathetic nervous system, reduces anxiety and sharpens focus. Especially important before a day of high-stakes decisions.

**- 6:00 AM – Black coffee + no screens**

Caffeine hits better when I’ve been awake for \~1.5 hrs. Also prevents anxiety spikes or rushed decisions.

**- 6:30 AM – Game plan review (no trades yet)**

I have a hard rule, no trading the 30 minutes before open. Instead, I use that time to:

Review my game plan (must be written the night before)

Chart out the overnight session (Asia + London highs/lows)

Update key levels or bias only if the overnight session justifies it

I always ask these 3 questions before entering a trade:

Where is price drawn to?

What is liquidity telling me?

Do I have confluence or am I forcing it?

No trade gets taken without a clear answer to all 3. No exceptions.

This routine isn’t about being perfect. It’s about showing up sharp, focused, and regulated, so that I can execute my edge without hesitation.

Happy to answer any questions or break this down further. I'm not saying you have to journal, meditate and cold plunge to become successful; this is just what worked for me and gave me clarity and routine.

1ma1ya6,2025-07-26,2025-07-26 15:25:15,Why Profitable Traders Rarely Share Their Strategies – A Hard Truth I Learned After 4 Years,"After struggling for three years in the forex market and finally becoming profitable in my fourth, I found myself asking a tough question: Why don’t experienced traders share their actual strategies?

I noticed that out of every 100 traders, maybe only two are willing to share a fully documented strategy—including any proprietary indicators, pairs they focus on, or their specific rules for execution. Even my mentor, who has over 11 years of experience, never actually gave me his strategy. Instead, he offered advice and guidelines, making me believe that following his teachings would eventually lead to consistent profitability. It helped, yes—but only to a point.

Let me break down a typical reason why profitable traders stay tight-lipped.

Take Smart Money Concepts (SMC) or even traditional support and resistance strategies. These approaches have been around for years. But when strategies become popular, they also become predictable. The same institutions and large players in the market—the so-called “smart money”—begin to exploit that predictability.

For example, a common supply and demand strategy might say:

“Buy at demand, place your stop-loss just below it, and aim for a 1:2 risk-reward ratio.”

Sounds simple. But when 99% of traders are doing exactly that, institutions will often push price slightly below the demand zone to trigger retail stop-losses—before reversing the market in the intended direction. This SL hunt clears out most traders, leaving only the 1% who waited patiently for the manipulation to play out and then entered with confirmation.

That’s exactly why only a small percentage of traders consistently make money. Most are using the same widely shared strategies, entering at the same levels, and placing stops in the same obvious places. In a game that punishes the predictable, doing what everyone else is doing just doesn’t work.

I used to think that not sharing strategies was selfish. But after learning the hard way, I understand now:

If a strategy truly works in the market and gains popularity, it becomes vulnerable to manipulation. Once it’s trending, it loses its edge.

Personally, I’m now open to sharing ideas—but only with traders who are serious about applying them uniquely, not those looking to copy-paste and hope for quick results. Also, it’s worth mentioning: many prop firms detect identical entries across accounts and may flag them as copy trading. So sharing exact entries or systems can actually hurt both parties.

There are many more reasons why profitable traders don’t openly share their strategies. ",527,199,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ma1ya6/why_profitable_traders_rarely_share_their/,year,Strategy,0.95
1li5gqn,2025-06-22,2025-06-22 22:35:07,Trading broke me,"Most people think trading is about money. Charts, setups, accounts. But the longer you’re in this game, the more you realize it’s not really about any of that. It’s about you. Your reactions. Your emotions. Your ability to sit still when every part of you wants to act. The market doesn’t just expose your weaknesses, it forces you to meet them face to face.

I used to believe I needed a better strategy,a new tool or a secret indicator, but what I really needed was to become someone who could follow the simple rules I already had. It sounds so obvious in hindsight right? cut losses, let winners run, manage risk. But when you're in the moment? That knowledge is useless unless you’ve trained yourself to act on it.

The truth is, trading feels easy until it’s real. It’s one thing to backtest or sim-trade. It’s another to watch real money vanish because you didn’t stick to your plan. That emotional spiral? The overtrading, the revenge entries, the panic exits because that’s what kills most traders. Not the market but, themselves.

Before trading I was a really confident gyu but it broke e down, showed me my flaws and obligated me to work on them to better myself and that’s what makes this journey so spiritual. Because if you stay long enough, you realize the goal isn’t to master the market. It’s to master your mind. You’re not just building a system, you’re building discipline, patience, self-awareness. The kind of traits that bleed into the rest of your life. It’s not about pressing buttons, it’s about becoming the kind of person who can press them with clarity.

I used to think trading would give me freedom and it has but not just financially. It’s forced me to grow into someone I never thought I could become. That’s why I keep showing up. That’s why I’ll never quit. Because win or lose, every session brings me closer to the version of me I’m chasing.

You stop relating to your friends. You can’t explain what you do to your family. Your routines, your goals, your mindset,  everything starts to drift away from the “normal” world. You feel like a stranger in familiar places, answering questions with half-truths just to avoid the blank stares.

But here’s the thing: that isolation carves out space.

For peace.

For discipline.

For you.

Trading isn’t for those who want validation. It’s for those who are okay walking alone.

Because the view at the top is quiet… but beautiful. If you are okay and comfortable in your own skin, you can thrive in trading and it can bring that out of you.

If you’re in that stage right now,  where it feels like no one gets you, keep going. You’re exactly where you need to be. You’re not chasing validation, you’re building freedom.

1n2y9h4,2025-08-29,2025-08-29 00:46:49,The Ugly Truth About How Long It Actually Takes To Make It In Trading,"Everyone thinks they’ll be the exception. I thought so too.

When I started, I figured one or two good years was all I needed to “crack it” and go full-time.

It took me four. And those four years looked nothing like I imagined.



Year one, I was on fire, or so I thought. Every setup I saw on YouTube went straight onto my chart. Sometimes I won big. Most times I lost bigger. I blamed my broker, my internet speed, the market… anything but me, it was never my fault, I started realizing this type of behavior in all aspects of my life.



Year two, the cracks started showing. I was no longer new, but I wasn’t good either. I’d keep switching strategies, half-heartedly journal trades, and convince myself that the next prop challenge would be “the one.” It never was.



Year three, I finally stopped trying to sprint. I stripped everything back to one market, one setup, one timeframe. I spent more time reviewing than trading. I tracked every trade, studied every miss, and realized my biggest leak wasn’t my strategy, it was me.



Year four, things got quiet. Boring. Profitable. I sized down, focused on base hits, and stopped chasing. Drawdowns became just part of the cycle instead of a crisis. My trading stopped feeling like gambling and started feeling like a business.



Some people can do this in less time. But unless you’re studying 12-14 hours a day, fully locked in, the market will humble you into taking the long route. And honestly? That’s not a bad thing. The time you “lose” learning is the time you gain in never having to blow it all again.

Now I’m climbing again.

Not fast, but sustainably, and that’s what matters most. 



My setups stayed the same, same timezone, I did however size down to micors and put minis aside ( I trade futures), dropped the risk lower ( I was risking 1-4% per trade, now down to 0.5-2%) and started building up a cushion again before sizing up.

1mwp11x,2025-08-21,2025-08-21 18:17:07,10 Things NOT To Do If You Want To Become a Profitable Trader,"
I’ve been trading swing options and day trading stocks for the last 8 years. I’ve blown accounts, overtraded, and made every mistake in the book. But through backtesting, journaling, and sheer repetition, I’ve figured out what separates consistent traders from the rest. Here are 10 things you must avoid if you want to get profitable:

1. Don’t chase every setup you see.
Early on, I tried to trade every pattern, every indicator, every hot stock. It spread me too thin. The breakthrough came when I focused on one model, backtested it 300+ times, and mastered it. Consistency comes from depth, not breadth.

2. Don’t ignore your risk per trade.
Sizing up randomly is the fastest way to blow an account. Pick a % you can live with, 1% or less is standard and track it. Once I started journaling risk vs reward in TradeZella, I saw my survival rate shoot up.

3. Don’t skip journaling.
Your memory is unreliable. Journaling gives you hard data. My biggest improvements came after I could see, in black and white, that revenge trades and premature exits were eating my edge alive.

4. Don’t trade without a plan.
Every trade should have levels, stop-loss, and profit targets before you enter. A plan doesn’t guarantee a win,it guarantees discipline. Forward testing plans helped me realize my execution was my real problem, not my strategy.

5. Don’t treat backtesting like busywork.
Backtesting isn’t about “curve fitting.” It’s about confidence. Once you see a setup play out 300+ times, hesitation disappears. It’s how I built conviction in both my swing setups and intraday scalps.

6. Don’t ignore market context.
A setup that prints money in trending conditions can bleed you dry in chop. I learned to separate my playbooks for different cycles, trending vs range-bound and my win rate stabilized.

7. Don’t get emotional with losses.
I’ve taken 10 losses in a row. What saved me wasn’t luck, it was keeping size small enough that my emotions didn’t hijack me. Most traders blow up not from bad strategies, but from spiraling after one loss.

8. Don’t let wins make you sloppy.
My worst days used to come after my best days. I’d get overconfident, size up recklessly, and give it all back. Journaling made me see this pattern clear as day. Now I step back after a big green streak.

9. Don’t compare your journey to others.
Everyone online looks like they’re making $10k a day. Most aren’t. My real growth came when I stopped chasing someone else’s results and doubled down on my process, one trade at a time.

10. Don’t forget this is a business.
Trading isn’t a hobby. It’s capital, risk, psychology, and systems. I treat my TradeZella journal like my business ledger. If the numbers don’t add up, the business fails.

After 8 years, here’s what I’ve learned: profitable trading isn’t about finding a holy grail. It’s about eliminating the dumb mistakes, building a repeatable system, and tracking it religiously. Backtest it. Journal it. Refine it. That’s how you turn chaos into consistency.",464,69,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1mwp11x/10_things_not_to_do_if_you_want_to_become_a/,year,Advice,0.99

Yet every time the price spikes, people start calling it “the future of money”… but that future never really comes.

I hear a lot about institutional adoption too, but if it's just big funds and whales manipulating price swings, what makes this a functional currency? If the average person is just holding the bag while institutions play the game, isn’t this just a fancier version of a pump-and-dump?

To be clear.. I actually like Bitcoin and have traded it for years. But every time I hear someone call it “digital gold,” I cringe through my teeth. Gold at least has non speculative value. It can be used in jewelry, industry it exists physically. You can hold it in your hand and it feels good to do so. People want to own it because it's a real 'thing'.

But stay in the game long enough and you realize it’s really about *you*. How you react. How you manage fear. How you sit on your hands when every instinct screams to act.

The market doesn’t just show you your strengths, it throws your weaknesses in your face. I used to think I needed a new strategy or the “right” indicator. Turns out, I just needed to become the kind of person who could follow the rules I already had,cut losses, let winners run, manage risk. Sounds simple, but in the moment? That’s where discipline gets tested.

Sim trading and backtesting feel safe. But when it’s real money and you break your rules, the spiral is brutal, overtrading, revenge entries, panic exits. The market doesn’t kill most traders but their own reactions do.

Before trading, I thought I was confident. But trading humbled me, exposed my flaws, and forced me to work on them. What’s worked for me has been a mix of things, journaling every trade in TradeZella and also running my own backtests in it, using funded accounts to scale, and surrounding myself with traders who hold me accountable in some discord groups, slowly fundinga personal acount and trading a cash account with my own rules.

Over time, I realized the goal isn’t just to master the market. It’s to master your mind. To build discipline, patience, and self-awareness that spill into the rest of your life. I know all the advice sounds cliche but it really is true, maybe if all the traders and investors are telling you the same thing, you should really listen,

I’m not saying discipline alone can replace having a proper strategy. What I am saying is this ,backtest your strategy until you trust it, find a mentor you respect if you can, and focus on just 1-2 markets, whether that’s indices, stocks, or forex. Learn what fits *you* best, whether it’s swing trading, scalping, or day trading. Don’t force yourself into a style that doesn’t feel natural. Get comfortable with your own approach and master it.

I thought trading would give me financial freedom, and it has (not Lambo or AP money like the furus you see online) but it’s also given me something bigger. Every session brings me closer to the version of myself I want to become. That’s why I keep showing up. That’s why I’ll never quit.

Asia session for me generally is red but London is a great session to trade due to it manipulating a high/low of Asia session then reversing to other direction high/low.



Cutting out unnecessary trades outside of those optimal hours and seeing immediate improvement.



Lesson Learned:

Time of day matters. Your strategy could be solid, but if you're applying it at the wrong times, you're just throwing away money.



I've also noticed the 30-minute window right before the NY session open is the absolute worst time to trade due to the Algo shooting up/down at open immediately to grab a quick liquidity pool before starting to move.



I’m now focusing only on my best hours and the results speak for themselves. Curious how others here figured out their optimal trading times. Was it trial and error for you too?

1j9rqkx,2025-03-12,2025-03-12 14:55:43,How I became profitable,"

I’ve been trading on and off for about 6 years. It took me 5 to become profitable not because I didn’t know what I was doing, but because I blew up every account I ever had . At least 20 times

I had to take a step back and do some deep self reflection as to what was holding me back. I had excellent technical analysis , I was trading the same few instruments, I knew how they move like the back of my hand, I was an expert in trading platforms and how to use them, I knew everything I needed about contracts and what strike prices etc everything you name it I had it all checked off

The only thing I didn’t have checked off was following my rules religiously. I would constantly over trade , revenge trade, turn winners into losers, take just one more trade ( always turned into a few more trades) full port etc. I was an emotional trader

The moment I said and ACTED ON RULES

“ I will follow my rules no matter what” “ I will respect my daily max loss no matter what” “ I will only trade within my appropriate position size no matter what” “ I will only take my A+ set ups no matter what” “ I will only take 1-3 trades no matter what” “ I will sign off after two small loses no matter what” “ I will not remove my stop loss no matter what” “ I will sign off after a good trade no matter what”

Is when I had consistently profitable weeks . Yes I had losing days , but I always recovered within a day or two and I avoided large loses Yes I didn’t make huge profits some days , but I added up wins to have winning weeks Yes I wanted to make more money, but I remembered all the times I went green to red

To any traders struggling but have a good system. The system is not what is holding you back, it’s your ability to let the system play out without making devastating mistakes.

You must re wire your mind to think in these ways and it WILL get you over that hump

 While psycholoy is important in trading, it's only relevant if you have the technicals and fundamentals down.

Hope this post can help any traders looking to improve on the mental side of trading!",390,89,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1j9rqkx/how_i_became_profitable/,year,Advice,0.98
1n0hl6z,2025-08-26,2025-08-26 05:55:09,My 2 cents on Trading - Grew $200k to $2 million in 5 years,"I think the sweet spot is in the combination of investing, swing trading and day trading. When done in harmony, they complement each other effectively. The primary goal is to grow your wealth. Whether what you are doing falls under investing or daytrading really shouldn't matter.

For example, one extremely effective strategy is core position trading. Find a stock that you are fully convicted in. Something you would have held long term anyway. Then trade around it by selling calls and puts. There is almost no way you could lose money with this approach other than the underlying itself is tanking. But if the underlying has a high likelihood of eventually going back up, in the long term, you will not be in loss. Finding such an underlying is not impossible based on the observation that US stock market goes up in the long run. So you can either choose some company form the top 1% or just pick something like QQQ or SPY. The only way you to not make money would be if SPY, which means the market itself, goes downward consistently over time.

I have been a living proof of this. I grew my wealth from $200k to $2 million in a matter of 5 years. Even without some luck factors, I did really well from trading. This year I wasn't particularly lucky, an average year, I have made $120k so far just from trading, not counting long term growth, which is another $150-200k. My monthly semi-passive income is now $10k.

So yeah, it is definitely possible to be a successful trader, if your expectations are reasonable. I consider 15-20% annual profit as a reasonable target for trading. But I have seen most traders target a lot higher. They end up taking lot more aggressive trades and losing money in the long run. For me, I was profitable from day one.

1hmsoym,2024-12-26,2024-12-26 12:04:51,Swing trades are the way,"I found the most success with swing trades. I started with mid cap shares, with basic information, mostly I’d just buy on Friday and usually sell on Wednesday. It was very easy and I was often consistently making money each week

Then I purchased a trading course where I actually learned how to trade, and purchased good trading software. This year, I started with the ABC strategy.. I make really good money. I run a scan for patterns in the market and pick a stock and set a buy and sell.. sometimes, I’m in and out on the same day, mostly it takes a few days. I only watch those stocks when I see them heat up, the rest of the time I’m out living my life. I have multiple swing positions, usually I’ll close at least 2 a week. Just now I closed a position in AMPX, I bought in last week 2.02 and sold at 2.315. That trade paid for the Christmas presents I purchased for my loved ones.

For me, this is very easy now. It does take an emotional toll, trading is stressful, but swing trading helps me minimize that stress and allows me to make good decisions without the noise. 

I assert that since I have adopted my style within the above strategy, this year.. my trades have been 100% successful. Sometimes I’ve been tied up longer than I wanted, some of my wins have been greater than others. But, i have taken a profit on every single trade. I will back up this assertion at a later date, I’ll publish a spreadsheet. 

Personally I think swing trading is the best way to be profitable. For the new traders out there, I would recommend you consider this strategy. It’s safe. Don’t trade crypto, or futures. Swing trade with stocks. Start with mid cap shares that show a consistent movement and buy the dip, sell as it tops. Simple easy money. Grow your portfolio over time. Don’t be greedy.

I don’t want to sound like I’m bragging, i don’t want naysayers to challenge me. But I am in awe of the money I make, it doesn’t feel real. Like I spent $180.00 on cologne, something I would never have purchased before.. but $180.00 just doesn’t feel like a lot of money anymore.

1n8ukqz,2025-09-04,2025-09-04 23:24:01,Lessons From a 7-Figure Trader (28R in August),"My mentor just wrapped up one of his best months this quarter, 28R net in August. He’s a 7-figure trader and what stood out to me wasn’t the P&L, but the principles he keeps hammering into me. I wanted to share them here because I know some of you are grinding through the same lessons.

https://preview.redd.it/7oxducf5l9nf1.jpg?width=990&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58d5c36d6af8abefb989ce4182e4aac18a035ef4

 

**1.Discipline beats “activity.”**

He didn’t take every setup under the sun. Only A+ plays. No random entries. The month was built on conviction trades he’s backtested a thousand times. Mostly focused on **$TSLA, $HOOD, $SNOW**

**2. Risk management creates freedom.**

A profit factor of 2.37 and a win/loss ratio near 3:1 didn’t happen by chance. He sized in only when risk was capped and stayed consistent with losers. His drawdowns were controlled, which kept him in the game. Only one small red week gives him confidence even more while he is already very green for the month.

**3. Know what works, know what doesn’t.**

Directional auctions and failed breakdowns worked beautifully. Range setups? Liquidity sweeps destroyed them. He doubled down on strengths and is already refining the weak spots.

**4. Leave money on the table? Good problem.**

His biggest critique of himself was not letting winners run. That says it all. Losing days were managed. Big days left untapped gains. It’s a reminder: you’re better off leaving money on the table than bleeding it back.

**5. Don’t force sync.**

If the market feels “off,” step away. Taking breaks is part of being consistent. Trading through chop only burns capital and confidence. (This is a part I struggled with heavily myself, trading feels like a drug sometimes, even though I say I won't trade, 5min later you find me in a trade.)

September game plan (the part I’m adopting too):

Review losing days deeply. Was it the setup, execution, or just market noise?

Only trade data-backed edges. Nothing else.

Focus on conviction: if the thesis isn’t clear, don’t touch it.

Accept missed trades. Missing is cheap, forcing is expensive.

I think the biggest lesson for me is that trading is not about catching every move, it’s about catching your move. The setups you know, the plays you trust, the risks you’re willing to take.

If a 7-figure trader is still journaling, reviewing, and refining after a 28R month, what excuse do we have?",350,106,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1n8ukqz/lessons_from_a_7figure_trader_28r_in_august/,year,Advice,0.93

• If you are just starting out trade micros only
• Don’t touch the minis. You’re not that guy. Yet

• Trade 1 lot size.
• Take 2-4 trades per day, max.

# Idea

Internal Bar Strength (IBS) is a technical analysis indicator used to gauge the relative position of a closing price within the daily trading range. Traders use it to determine momentum. IBS is particularly effective when used as mean-reversion strategy.

The Internal Bar Strength is calculated using the formula:

**IBS = (Close - Low ) / (High - Low)**

* *Low IBS values (< 0.2):* May indicate oversold conditions, suggesting a possible upward move.
* *High IBS values (> 0.8):* May signal overbought conditions, indicating a potential downward move.

# Strategy

* **Instrument**: US100 (NQ)
* **TF**: 1D (*The strategy does not work on time frames below)*
* **Initial Capital:** 10k$
* **Risked Money**: 500$
* **Data Period**: 2009.01.01 - 2024.12.04

*The strategy buys only if there are no open trades. That is, there can be only 1 trade at a time.*  
*The strategy does not have a shortsell trades as instrument is often in the uptrend.*

***Inputs:***

1. Low\_IBS - **0.1**/0.2/0.3
2. High\_IBS - 0.75/0.8/**0.9**

**Buy Rule:** IBS < Low\_IBS  
**Close Rule**: IBS > High\_IBS. Exit after 30 days.

Since it is a [Mean Reversion](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/mean-reversion) strategy:  
**I do not recommend using the Stop Loss** as it increases the drawdown and reduces the profit.  
**I don’t recommend using Take Profit** as it reduces profits.

# Conclusions

1. Works any time of year and doesn't require a filter.
2. Uses a unique indicator, which is usually not available in trading platforms.
3. There are problems with the exit rule. It's often too late, worth considering.
4. Compared to other Mean Reversions it has a fairly low winrate, low profit factor.
5. Behaves too differently on different instruments and on different parameters.
6. Even alone without a portfolio of strategies with the right risk management can beat the returns of the index itself!

1l2j1nm,2025-06-03,2025-06-03 14:09:40,"4 Years Alone, No Support, No Results… Until I Shut Up and Worked.","Hi everyone, today is a big day for me. I’ve been in the markets for almost 4 years now (way before the “gurus” came in and ruined the image of trading by making it seem like easy money), and I’d like to share my journey with you. I hope it can inspire some of you.

When I first started, I was super excited. It felt like I had found something special, something no one around me really understood or even cared about. None of my friends were talking about it, they weren’t even interested. For 4 years, I was completely alone, reading, learning, and developing a real passion for macroeconomics. That’s where I discovered my potential. I loved it, and I was able to anticipate market movements pretty naturally.

At 18, I decided to go all in. Not just backtesting anymore, but actually trading with real money. I started with a $50 live account, and within a few months, I turned it into $300. I didn’t use stop losses (I was overconfident), but I didn’t overleverage either. I always calculated my risk-to-reward before entering a trade. I wasn’t gambling I knew what I was doing. But I didn’t know how to manage it properly.

For nearly 3 years, every time I hit a 1:1 RR, I closed the trade… only to watch price go exactly where I had predicted. I knew something was missing. And then I learned one of the most important lessons: the market doesn’t reward you for predicting it, it rewards you for managing it and actually making money off it.

And the truth is, I was a top student. I was enrolled in a pretty demanding academic program, but little by little, I started skipping classes. I’d spend all my time trading in the library before class, during, and after. I failed all my exams and stopped going to school entirely. That’s when the real problems started. To my parents, I was a failure. I shut myself off from everyone… but deep down, I still had this dream burning inside me.

Throughout this entire journey, I knew exactly what I was doing. But I never made money off my trades. Why? Because I hesitated too much. I kept thinking: “This is too easy it can’t be real. Easy money doesn’t exist.” I was scared I’d lose everything, like in the stories of all the great traders who went broke. So I just sat in front of my screen, watching the market do exactly what I predicted… but without taking the trade, frozen by doubt.

The moment I stopped talking about it with my parents that’s when things changed. I made them believe I was going to school, but in reality, I was trading. And for the first time, I started making money. That’s when I realized: my environment was pulling me down and making me doubt myself. As soon as I stopped looking for validation, everything shifted.

I read tons of books on trading and psychology and worked hard to build mental discipline. And that’s how I became a profitable trader. People have always said I’m a big dreamer but you know what? Most people don’t even know how to dream. I turned my dream into a goal, and that goal into reality.

Today, I’m funded on a 10k account and a 100k account for over a year now, and I just finished the evaluation for a 200k account. I’ve taken 3 evaluations so far, and I passed all 3. My secret? I visualized myself as a consistent, profitable trader before I actually became one. That’s how you turn a dream into success.

So, how do you see yourself?

1nkhybe,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 15:33:31,Trading Is the Hardest Thing I’ve Ever Done,"

I grew up in a small town in Mexico. My parents worked jobs that barely kept food on the table, and from a young age, I knew if I wanted something more, I’d have to figure it out myself. At 19, I crossed the border with nothing but a backpack, a few clothes, and a dream of building a better life.

I washed dishes, stocked shelves overnight, and sent money home when I could. I shared a one-bedroom apartment with three other guys just to cover rent. Some weeks I worked 70–80 hours, only to end up with barely enough left to buy groceries. It was exhausting, but I kept telling myself, “This is temporary, justy keep moving.”

Then I discovered amazon FBA, failed. Dropshipping, failed and then finallly trading. I thought it would be my escape, finally a way to use my brain instead of my back. I opened a brokerage account, put in a few thousand dollars, and thought I could flip it fast. I lost it all in less than two months. The frustration was unreal. I felt like I was running in circles: breaking my body at work, then burning through savings at night chasing green candles.

But I didn’t quit. I slowed down and started studying. I found futures and realized this was a real profession, not a shortcut. I backtested for months. I journaled every mistake. I cut my size to the smallest possible and focused on surviving first. Slowly, things started to click. My first payout from a prop firm wasn’t big, just $1,000 but it felt like the world to me. It proved I wasn’t crazy for believing I could do this.

Here’s what trading taught me: it’s not a hustle, it’s a mirror. It shows you every weakness and impatience, ego, greed and forces you to deal with them. That’s why it’s harder than any job I’ve ever worked. Because it doesn’t just demand skill; it demands you to change who you are.

Today, I’m not rich, but I’m consistent. I can finally say I trade with confidence. I still send money home. I still live simply. But I built this life from nothing, and that’s something no one can take from me.

And if there’s one thing I know for sure:

1lt72ps,2025-07-06,2025-07-06 13:38:20,"What losing $67,000 taught me about risk.","December 2024 was the worst month of my trading career. Ironically, it came right after my best months ever. I was on top of the world, trading 20 funded accounts at the same time, pulling profits consistently for weeks. It felt like I couldn’t lose and that overconfidence was the start of my downfall.



The mistake? I broke my own rules. My risk plan was simple: take 75% off at 2R, leave a runner for 4R or a clear draw on liquidity. But I got greedy. I skipped the 2R partials and tried to hold the full position for big home-run trades, thinking I could push every move to 3-6R. What I didn’t account for was the holiday chop. Markets slowed, reversals were brutal, and most trades barely made 1R before snapping back. One by one, I watched profits evaporate.



In the end, I lost all the gains I’d worked so hard for and the accounts themselves. $67,000 gone. The worst part wasn’t the money, but realizing I’d let discipline slip right when it mattered most. What I learned is simple but painful: the market punishes arrogance. Sticking to your plan matters more than any single trade, and risking consistency for ego is never worth it.

1mnz9d2,2025-08-12,2025-08-12 00:33:25,7 things I stopped doing that finally made me profitable,"It took me years to figure this out,not because the markets are hiding secrets, but because my bad habits kept getting in the way. The truth is, my strategy was good enough a long time ago. What wasn’t good enough was how I was approaching it. Here are the 7 things I cut out that changed everything.



**1. Trading all day, every day**

I used to think more screen time meant more money. It was the opposite. The longer I sat there, the more likely I was to take impulsive trades. Now I have a fixed time window. If I don’t get my setup in that window, I’m done. Fewer hours. Better trades. More mental energy.



**2. Ignoring journaling**

For years, I kept telling myself “I’ll remember this trade”  and then I’d forget why I took it two days later. Now I journal every single trade. I write down the setup, entry, stop, target, market context, and post-trade thoughts. I track all of this in my journaling software, which makes it easy to see patterns and spot the mistakes I keep repeating. At the end of each week, I review my journal like game tape. It’s uncomfortable at times, but it’s where the growth happens. I’ll drop my template pics in the comments so you can copy them.



**3. Backtesting only when I felt like it**

When I backtested weekly, my execution sharpened and my confidence went up. When I skipped it, doubt crept in and bad habits returned. Now I run through at least 20-30 examples of my setups every weekend. I have a backtesting software I use that makes this part faster since I can filter my trades by setup and study them in bulk. It’s like sharpening your tools before the next work week, a non-**negotiable.**



**4. Taking “and then some” trades**

This was killing me slowly. I’d hit my daily target and then think, “One more can’t hurt.” It hurt. The extra trade was usually lower quality and taken out of boredom, not conviction. Now, when my plan is done, I’m done. No exceptions.



**5. Counter-trend gambling**

I convinced myself I could “catch the turn” more often than not. The truth? I was giving back profits trying to be a hero. Now I let the trend be the trend until my setup tells me otherwise. The money is in trading what is, not what I think should be.



**6. Trading without a clear bias**

There’s a difference between “no bias” and “confused bias.” I’d flip flop all day because I didn’t have a clear game plan. Now I build my bias pre-market and only shift it if the market gives me undeniable evidence to do so. It keeps me from reacting to every wiggle.



**7. Ignoring the drawdown rules I knew I should follow**

When I hit drawdown, I used to size up to “make it back faster.” That’s the exact mindset that blows accounts. Now I cut size down to 1-2 micros until I’m back in rhythm. It’s slower, but it rebuilds both my account and my confidence at the same time.



Cutting these habits didn’t just make me profitable, it made trading boring in the best way possible. No more rollercoaster. No more adrenaline chasing. Just execution, review, and slow growth that compounds over time.



If you’re struggling, you probably don’t need a new strategy. You need to stop doing the things that are sabotaging the one you already have. Journaling, backtesting, and tracking your progress with proper tools (not just trading view) has been the biggest difference maker for me.

1m8fzup,2025-07-24,2025-07-24 16:53:19,Trading will humble you in ways you’re not ready for.,"I don’t care how smart you think you are.

The market will break your ego, your illusions of control, and your sense of certainty.

You’ll take a perfect setup, execute perfectly, and still lose.

You’ll have a green week and think you’re invincible, only to get smacked in the face the next day.

You’ll watch a trade rip in your direction right after you exit because you couldn’t handle the drawdown.

You’ll feel alone because nobody around you truly understands this game.

You’ll question yourself, your process, and your future more times than you want to admit.

But if you let it, trading will also build you:

- It will force you to take radical responsibility for your decisions.
- It will teach you discipline when it’s boring and patience when it’s painful.
- It will show you how to manage your emotions under pressure.
- It will teach you that uncertainty is normal, and the goal isn’t to predict but to manage risk.

Most people don’t fail at trading because they can’t read a chart.

They fail because they can’t manage themselves.

They fail because they keep chasing dopamine instead of discipline.

They fail because they let one bad day turn into blowing up their account.

If you’re in the trenches right now, feeling stuck, you’re not alone.

Trading is simple, but it’s not easy.

Your job is to keep showing up, keep refining your edge, and keep working on yourself.

Because the moment you think you’ve “figured it out,” the market will humble you again.

I'm not going to talk about the journey but it has been anything but linear)

Just want to share some things that I believe after all this time, my closest friends are mostly all traders 

  
1. Even when you get to a point of ""profitability"" it doesn't mean that tilts magically disappear - if you get triggered by something outside of your trading like wifi stops working, body feeling funky, getting a negative text message - anything can affect your trading and trigger you into a tilt. 

2. The more I trade, the simpler I make my system. I don't trade with indicators anymore as they are simply just lagging indicators making calculations based on past price. (everyone I know that are successful trades purely price action, S/D and sometimes VWAP) 

3. Bad trading is often because of a non clarified system - (I have my on ONE PAGE - I call it the ""one page trading plan"") - Because you can't keep to many things in your head at the same time, as too many conscious thoughts at the same time will create emotions 

4. Successful trading often comes after a hard choice. I made this choice when I lost everything I ever had + had to take out a loan to survive. ""will I quit, or am I going to do EVERYTHING that I can to make it?"" 

5. The number 1 thing to focus on is to keep yourself feeling like a professional trader. ""What can I do today to feel like a professional trader"" - the belief is number 1. 

6. Trading is easier with less trades. It feels like you need to take more trades to make more money, but that will come at the cost of emotional damage. And emotional damage creates bad trading.

7. The number one skill I've found from trading is emotional regulation. It's helping my trading so much, and at the same time makes everything else in life much easier.

1ii4i6o,2025-02-05,2025-02-05 02:10:41,Risk management lessons I wish I’d learned earlier,"Fellow traders,

Sharing another simple truths post as I continue documenting my trading journey—the real, unfiltered version. No hype, no shortcuts, and definitely no bragging. Just lessons learned the hard way that anyone starting out might find useful.

Early on in my trading journey, I had a strategy that worked… until it didn’t. One missed order wiped out weeks of progress. That was my wake-up call, even the best strategy means nothing without solid risk management. It’s like driving without brakes—sooner or later, you crash.

These days, I stick to strict risk parameters—stop-losses, position sizing, and clear drawdown limits. It’s not the flashiest part of trading, but looking back, it’s the only way to stay in the game long enough to be profitable.

Here are a few lessons I wish I had learned earlier:

1. **Plan your trade then trade your plan.** A solid strategy only works if you stick to it—emotional decisions in the moment can undo everything.
2. **Position sizing matters.** Never risk more than you’re truly willing to lose on any single trade.
3. **Stop-losses are non-negotiable.** They’re your safety net—use them.
4. **Losses are part of the game.** Accept them, learn from them, and move forward.
5. **Have a drawdown limit.** Know when to step away before you start chasing losses.

**TL;DR:** A great strategy without risk management won’t get you far. Use stop-losses, position sizing, and drawdown limits to protect your downside. Learn from your mistakes and always stick to your plan.

Would be great to hear your go-to risk management rules—let’s share ideas and improve together.",291,35,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ii4i6o/risk_management_lessons_i_wish_id_learned_earlier/,year,Strategy,1.0
1gzrlg2,2024-11-25,2024-11-25 14:34:29,"If you’re still unprofitable, read this.","Hey everyone, I get a lot of messages on this topic so let’s jump into it. Hopefully you could pick up something. 

1. Charting, Technical analysis, is not the whole game. Any bloke can learn TA and draw couple of lines. This isn’t art class. This is about making money. A lot of time I hear traders say: “but it didn’t respect my trend line”. You think the market cares about the trend line you drew on your screen? All this to say, if your only way of trading is being a great chart artist, you’re in for a long painful ride. Being a great chartist is just a piece of the pie. 

2. Some Products are more BUY biased than others. Some products are more SELL biased than others. This is due to the nature and fundamentals of the product and the psychology of whom is buying and selling these products. 

Let’s take EUR/USD for example. You have a MUCH higher probability of making money shorting it high than trying to buy it low. The reason for this is the nature of the fundamental of the product. 

The Euro has low interest rates. The US dollar has much higher interest rates than the euro. What this means is, for every chance the central banks get to sell their Euro high in exchange for Dollar, they’re most keen to take that trade. As owning Dollar pays more than owning Euro. 

So stop fighting logic of economics and trying to long a majority shorted product. 

Change your approach towards tailoring your charting towards setting up high value shorts only instead of always trying to long and buy. 

So start learning the fundamentals of the product you’re trading. If you don’t understand the economics of the product you’re trading… you should not be trading it. 

I’ve seen so many traders say “I lost s money on GBPCHF”. Meanwhile they know nothing about what drives the Swiss franc and don’t understand its supply demand reasoning pinned against the pound. 

Learn your Dam products… and establish a directional bias. It’s not all just charting.

3. You’re under capitalized and that’s killing you. If you have no money, let’s face it; the odds are against you making a decent living in this space.

On a 10k account, You’ll drive yourself in a well of despair trying to turn profitable, you have a low margin for error due to the amounts of profit you wish to make. 4-5$ a trade really isn’t anything….you’ll psychologically try to take more trades than you’re used to, to make EXTRA money. You’ll get frustrated and over leverage. I don’t care who you are. 10k isn’t much in this day and age. You need a decent size account. Typically I’ll say 30k and up to make some sort of living that makes some sense.

PROP FIRMS aren’t much better, as they are designed for you to fail and keep paying them to keep taking their challenge. That’s the business. Trading is hard enough as it is, now you want to put a 4% daily drawdown limit? And at every chance you get close me out? You limit the power of natural trading. 

4. You’re up on a trade, but you’re deluded into thinking it needs to hit your magical TP LEVEL or else you won’t get you R:R you were looking for.

You leave money on the table sitting there. I laugh at traders who are up on a trade and wait to take profit until it hits their level of “analysis”

The game isn’t about a level being hit to fuel your ego. It’s about getting paid. Stop leaving money on the table.

I see so many traders wait and then the trade reverses and goes to their stop loss level. 

What is this stupidity. Take money when you’re up. Keep finding great entries and bank that profit. This small adjustment alone can be the difference you need. 

5. If you’ve followed everything above and are still unprofitable, it’s time you get a Mentor and maybe switch from swing trading to scalping or scalp to swing trading to scalp. Sometimes you need to just switch it up. Everything you learnt isn’t for nothing. It’s still experience and knowledge. A mentor can help you break a plateau and tell you things you’ve been overlooking. Kind of like this post. 
—————————

I’ll end it here. There’s so many things to consider trading. It takes time. It takes years typically. If you’re not profitable yet, keep grinding, keep getting better. Change the conditions and put the game in your favour.

# Idea

US-100 often experience phases of excessive optimism (overbought) and pessimism (oversold), where prices deviate significantly from their mean value. The mean reversion strategy aims to capitalize on these deviations by entering trades when prices are likely to revert to their average.

The [CCI ](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/commodity-channel-index)indicator itself shows how much the price deviates from the mean. This is what you need for a Mean Reversion strategy!

# Strategy

* **Instrument**: US100 (NQ)
* **TF**: 1D (*The strategy does not work on time frames below)*
* **Initial Capital:** 10k$
* **Risked Money**: 500$
* **Data Period**: 2012.01.19 - 2024.11.28

*The strategy buys only if there are no open trades. That is, there can be only 1 trade at a time.*  
*The strategy does not have a shortsell trades as instrument is often in the uptrend.*

***Inputs:***

1. Period: **4**/7/14
2. LowTh: **-100**/-75/-50
3. HighTh: **50**/75/100

**Buy Rules:** CCI(Period) < LowTh  
**Close Rule**: CCI(Period) > HighTh

Since it is a [Mean Reversion](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/mean-reversion) strategy:  
**I do not recommend using the Stop Loss** as it increases the drawdown and reduces the profit.  
**I don’t recommend using Take Profit** as it reduces profits.

# Conclusions

1. CCI is the best indicator for Mean Reversion strategies
2. The strategy works well on all MR instruments
3. 71% winrate, which is pretty normal for Mean Reversion
4. You need to select different parameters for each instrument. Experiment with other indicators in combination for enters and exits

You have to build it yourself. You have to put in the time, make the mistakes, and actually figure out why those mistakes happen.

The only way to grow is by being on the charts. Not just copying someone else’s signals, but watching the market, experimenting, adjusting, and learning. Every failed trade is a lesson — you find what went wrong, fix it, and keep going.

This repetition - watch, fail, adjust, repeat - eventually rewires how you see the market. Patterns start jumping out at you, your instincts sharpen. Not because a mentor told you so, but because you’ve trained your own eyes over and over again.

But here’s the catch: it takes time. Sometimes months, even years. And that’s perfectly normal.

Forget the flashy “100% win rate” stuff and quick-money promises. Real progress comes from the quiet grind: reviewing, testing, and improving every single day. That’s where your edge is built.

**This document is for anyone curious about the reasoning behind our process and thinking, or for those seeking deep trading knowledge.**

***Pause and read when something piques your interest. Judge by citation.***

**1. Random Walk & Market Efficiency**

**Eugene Fama - THE BEHAVIOR OF STOCK-MARKET PRICES**

**Key Part:**

“By contrast the theory of random walks says that the future path of the price level of a security is no more predictable than the path of a series of cumulated random numbers. In statistical terms the theory says that successive price changes are independent, identically distributed random variables. Most simply this implies that the series of price changes has no memory, that is, the past cannot be used to predict the future in any meaningful way”

**Note:**  
We are not suggesting the market is 100% efficient/random. We referenced this to show how randomness in a market isn’t good for your bottom line. The more efficient/random a market is the harder it is to trade profitably

**Eugene Fama - Random Walks in Stock Market Prices.**

**Key Takeaway:**

if the random-walk theory is an accurate description of reality, then the various “technical” or “chartist” procedures for predicting stock prices are completely without value.

 

**Burton Malkiel - A Random Walk Down Wall Street**

**Key Lines:**

“A random walk is one in which future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past history. When the term is applied to the stock market, it means that short-run changes in stock prices are unpredictable”

“Mathematicians call a sequence of numbers produced by a random process (such as those on our simulated stock chart) a random walk. The next move on the chart is completely unpredictable on the basis of what has happened before.” – **Referencing Random Candlestick Charts**

[A Random Chart](https://preview.redd.it/vub60qytg4sf1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d82d67028281adb41fc414a6e4cc7c8c85bfa2d)

**The core lesson of the random‐walk theory is that you cannot predict future market price movements by studying historical data if the market is 100% random.**

 

**2. Alpha/Market Edge Decay & Why no profitable trader would sell or give away their strategy for free.\[1\]**

**Julien Penasse - Understanding Alpha Decay**

 

**Highlights that alpha (edge over market) tends to diminish. alpha decay is generally a nonstationary phenomenon/inconsistent. Julien leverages studied anomalies for credibility.**

**Key Parts:** “Because alpha decay is generally a non-stationary phenomenon, asset pricing tests that impose stationarity may lead to biased inference. I illustrate the importance of alpha decay using the most commonly-studied anomalies in the asset pricing literature”

“Alpha decay refers to the reduction in abnormal expected returns (relative to an asset pricing model) in response to an anomaly becoming widely known among market participants” **\[1\]**

 

**This is popular, modern and potent evidence that alpha decay and edge decay is real.**

**Does Academic Research Destroy Stock Return Predictability? - Journal of Finance, R. David McLean**

**Published in 2016**

**Key takeaway:**

“Portfolio returns are 26% lower out-of-sample and 58% lower post-publication. The out-of-sample decline is an upper bound estimate of data mining effects. We estimate a 32% (58% - 26%) lower return from publication-informed trading.”

 

**On the Effect of Alpha Decay and Transaction Costs on the Multi-period Optimal Trading Strategy** by Chutian Ma and Paul Smith (2025):

The approach shown on this paper captures the essence of alpha decay by allowing the strength of signals to wane as they age, reflecting reality where the effectiveness of trading signals decrease over time. Re-enforcing the idea of edge / alpha decay.

Present in the ABSTRACT: **“To simulate alpha decay, we consider a case where not only the present value of a signal, but also past values, have predictive power”**

**Admati & Pfleiderer - A Theory of Intraday Patterns**

**Key Parts:**

Paper documents intraday volume & volatility U‐shape across NYSE hours.

Ex Table 1 show how volume and volatility vary through NYSE hours.

**4. Mean Reversion vs. Trending Characterization**

**Intraday mean-reversion after open shocks: Grant, Wolf, and Yu (2005) document strong reversal effects in US equity index futures**

**Key Lines:**

This paper gives a long-term assessment of intraday price reversals in the US stock index futures market following large price changes at the market open. We find highly significant intraday price reversals over a 15-year period (November 1987-September 2002) as well as significant intraday reversals in our yearly and day-of-the-week investigations. Moreover, the strength of the intraday overreaction phenomenon seems more pronounced following large positive price changes at the market open.

 That being said, the question of whether a trader can consistently profit from this information remains open as the significance of intraday price reversals is sharply reduced when gross trading results are adjusted by a bid-ask proxy for transactions costs.

 

**Rama Cont - Empirical Properties of Asset Returns**

**Key Lines:**

Table 1 lists “Volatility Clustering” and “Gain/loss asymmetry” i.e Mean reversion characteristics for major indices.

 

**5. Backtesting**

**Bailey, López de Prado & Zhu - Pseudo‐Mathematics and Financial Charlatanism**

**Key Lines**

We prove that high simulated performance is easily achievable after backtesting a relatively small number of alternative strategy configurations, a practice we denote ‘backtest overfitting

The higher the number of configurations tried, the greater is the probability that the backtest is overfit... Under memory effects, backtest overfitting leads to negative expected returns out-of-sample, rather than zero performance.

**6. Order Flow, Microstructure and how markets work**

**Albert S. Kyle - Continuous Auctions and Insider Trading**

**Key Lines for us:**

**Albert S. Kyle** “Perhaps the most interesting properties concern the liquidity characteristics of the market in a continuous auction equilibrium. ""Market liquidity"" is a slippery and elusive concept, in part because it encompasses a number of transactional properties of markets. These include ""tightness"" (the cost of turning around a position over a short period of time), ""depth"" (the size of an order flow innovation required to change prices a given amount), and ""resiliency"" (the speed with which prices recover from a random, uninformative shock). Black \[2\] describes intuitively a liquid market in the following manner: ""The market for a stock is liquid if the following conditions hold: (1) There are always bid and asked prices for the investor who wants to buy or sell small amounts of stock immediately. (2) The difference between the bid and asked prices (the spread) is always small”

Kyle breaks down what Market liquidity is and What makes a market liquid showing that imbalances between buyers and sellers i.e. imbalance in liquidity is the reason why price moves. To us this is obvious but many traders don’t consider it.

Parts 1.5, 3.10, and 3.11 were well written and more on point; Part 3.12 is an amusing read too.

**Present in the ABSTRACT:**

""Belief in one's ability to exert control over the environment and to produce desired results is essential for an individual's wellbeing. It has repeatedly been argued that perception of control is not only desirable, but is also probably a psychological and biological necessity. In this article, we review the literature supporting this claim and present evidence of a biological basis for the need for control and for choice-that is, the means by which we exercise control over the environment.

\- For context from Ron: Total Return Swaps (TRS) and Contract for Difference (CFDs) are similar in that both allow you to gain exposure to an asset’s price changes/performance without owning it outright. You benefit from price changes and, depending on the contract & type even receive or pay income like dividends or interest. Both involve paying financing costs if you hold positions overnight (swap fees)

# Definitions written by Ali (SentientAnalyzer)

**1.Constraints**

What limits you - time, capital, lifestyle. These set the boundaries for what you can actually trade. Your system must respect them.

**2. Market Type**

Behaviour of a market: mean reverting, trending, or random/alternating.

**3. Valid Trading Window**

The hours when you’re allowed to trade. Based on where volume and volatility are, not your convenience.

**4. Risk (R)**

The set amount of capital you’re willing to lose per trade. Fixed, consistent. Example: 1R = 3%.

**5. RRR**

Risk-to-reward ratio (e.g. 1:3 = risk $100 to make $300).

**6. Order-Flow Mechanics**

Price moves because buyers and sellers are imbalanced. That’s it. It explains rejections and moves - it’s not an edge, it’s just reality.

**7. 3-Wick Setup**

Three wicks rejecting a level - signals price has repeated selling activity and won’t break through. Must be rule-based, not subjective.

**8. Tick**

The smallest price increment on an instrument.

**9. Execution**

Cost Spreads, commissions, and slippage affecting net performance. Ignore it and your edge vanishes.

**10. Backtest**

Testing your rules on past data. Done honestly - no scrolling, no cherrypicking, no hindsight. Bar Replay below in

**11. Overfitting**

When your strategy works only on the past because you’ve shaped it to work on past historical data instead of applying and idea to historical data. Looks good in testing, fails live.

**12. Stress Test**

Deliberately run your system in bad conditions. These are notable periods of intraday chop, low volume on trend trading strategies and periods of relentless trends on mean reversion/reversal strategies. If it collapses, it’s weak.

Example: Someone could be running a mean reversion day trading system on YM and he could stress test August 8th to September 13th 2024 as an example, where, here Dow Jones exhibited strong trending behaviour which is against the system’s nature.

**13. Bar Replay Play**

charts forward candle by candle to mimic real-time. Helps you test if you’d actually take your setups live. E.g., TradingView Bar Replay

**14. Scaling In**

Adding size after entry. Must be planned and tested - not just done because “it looks good”.

**15. Hedge**

Open a position benefiting from movements in the opposite direction. Useful at times, but messy if you don’t have clear rules.

**16. Breakeven/Partials**

Closing part/all of the trade early. Often reduces long-term edge unless justified by data.

**17. Ghost Liquidity**

Orders that aren’t visible but sit around visible levels. Cause sharp reactions or none at all. It’s just a surge of liquidity that isn’t visible on the books.

**18. Random Walk**

Price sometimes moves like noise. Most patterns don’t work unless they’re backed by logic. A Random Walk is a market that is 100% random. In other words, it is effectively a completely efficient market where no edge is possible. Real markets are of course different.

**19. Bracketed Limit Orders**

Pre-set entry, stop, and take-profit. Forces discipline. Removes intuition and discretion.

**20. Institutional Narrative Fallacy**

The idea that “smart money” always leaves clues. Usually marketing fluff. If it’s not testable, it’s not valid.

**21. Data Snooping**

Repeatedly looking at a data series from different angles to confirm something that you haven’t defined ahead of time often leading to insignificant and/or biased discoveries. Essentially looking too hard for patterns and finding things that don’t actually repeat. Typically kills forward performance.

**22. Drawdown**

How far your strategy drops from peaks in tests. Crucial for knowing how big your positions should be in advance. For example, a trader could have a max losing streak of 8 but your peak to trough could be 12x your risk (some wins followed by strings of losses repeatedly create this) – Super important to track and know. That’s the maximum drawdown you should be taking into account especially if working with prop firms.

**23. Dynamic Targeting**

Set targets based on real market structure - swing highs, lows, clusters of wicks. not arbitrary price movements e.g., 100 points, 100 handles, 100 pips, 100 ticks. Market is too dynamic for a one size fits all.

**24. Expectancy**

The average gain or loss per trade. Strategies don’t need high win rates - it needs consistency in the data and logical backing: Expectancy = average win × win rate − (1 − win rate) × average loss.

**25. Logic-Driven Rule** A rule built on how the market behaves - not what a shape on a chart looks like or some untested theory. For example purposes only, using the 3 wicks example. Bar 1 closes with a wick high; this shows that there was selling pressure. If the next candle interacts with bar 1’s high but fails to close above, creating another wick, it shows continued selling pressure. If on bar 3 it happens again, it shows compounded selling pressure. If it reverses, it should do so quickly. If price continues beyond the wicks, price should continue trending. Using a small stop loss relative to the target can create an edge if costs are managed properly.

https://preview.redd.it/06he0pjhq4hf1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e74092dc4e4d79246d039614cff702d44a92e24

For months, I thought I had a strategy problem. I was taking clean setups, trading my model, and trusting my edge but my P&L said otherwise. I ended up down over $3,300, with a 23.26% win rate and a score of just 46.45. My average R was 2.27, and I was going for 2R base hits with 4R runners but the problem wasn’t the math. It was the psychology of holding through losses, getting stopped out repeatedly, and chasing that one big winner to fix everything.



The red days stacked up. You can see it in the first chart, net daily P&L bled out nearly every session. My profit factor was under 1.0, and my consistency and drawdown metrics were completely skewed. Even on the rare days I won, the pressure of needing the trade to work was overwhelming. This kind of environment makes you force entries, revenge trade, and second-guess every setup.



Then I made one change, I lowered my risk-to-reward. I started taking profits at 1R to 1.5R and only held for more if the market was flowing clean. I focused on discipline, not dollars. I tracked everything religiously and shifted my mindset from “catch the big one” to “stack the small wins.” The shift was subtle, but the results were massive.



Fast forward to the second image, now I’m sitting at a 71.43% win rate, with a 3.04 profit factor and a score of 81.5. My P&L flipped from red to green, with +$2,465 in net profit across 28 trades. More importantly, look at the smoothness of that equity curve. I’m not trading better setups, I’m just managing them better. My average win is lower now ($184 vs $747 before), but my losses are also smaller, and they don’t break my confidence.



Your strategy isn’t always the issue. Sometimes your risk model is too aggressive for your psychology. By reducing pressure, I increased performance. That’s the real edge. Don’t fix what’s working, fix how you execute it. 



Put yourself in situations that keep you the most calm.

1mqlk32,2025-08-14,2025-08-14 22:55:26,How I make a living with a sub-50% win rate,"Most new traders think they need to be right 70 to 80% of the time to make money. The reality is, you can be wrong more than you’re right and still come out far ahead, if you manage risk properly. My win rate over this period was 43.5%, and my shorts were even lower at 41.6%. Yet, my equity curve kept climbing steadily.



The key is in my risk-to-reward ratio and trade expectancy. My average trade win/loss is 2.54. That means when I win, I make more than double what I lose on an average losing trade. My trade expectancy, the amount I expect to make per trade over time, sits at $99.42. This combination means that even with less than half of my trades being winners, the math works out in my favor.



You can see it in the PnL chart I’ve attached. There were drawdowns, sure, but the slope is positive because my losers are contained and my winners are allowed to run. My largest winning trade was $3,050, while my largest loss was $1,137. Keeping losses smaller and letting the big ones work is what makes the curve trend upward.



[I journal my trades using tradezella.](https://preview.redd.it/mwzlq6e4l3jf1.png?width=1650&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b23783ab5729477823a6ede06e6ee8754ac4ee)

Another thing that helps is consistency. My average daily win/loss stayed stable after the early volatility. Once I stopped overtrading and forced myself to stick to my setups, the chart smoothed out. That’s not an accident, it’s the direct result of following a process and tracking my performance trade by trade.



A big part of that process is my Forever Model setup. In simple terms, it’s a specific pattern I look for when the market sweeps a key level, shifts direction, and leaves behind a gap in price that often gets retested. I wait for that retest, look for confirmation that price is reacting, and then take my entry in the direction of that move. It’s nothing magical, it’s just reading liquidity and timing entries where the risk is smallest. If you want a video breakdown of it lmk, I'll send it to you for free, I've posted it on Reddit plenty of times.



The beauty of the Forever Model is that it keeps me patient. I’m not taking random trades all day. I’m waiting for the market to show its hand. That’s why my stats look the way they do, fewer trades, higher quality, bigger winners than losers. If you’re still struggling with consistency, find one setup that fits your personality and master it. That’s when your numbers start working for you instead of against you.",273,141,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1mqlk32/how_i_make_a_living_with_a_sub50_win_rate/,year,Due-diligence,0.96
1ia4568,2025-01-25,2025-01-25 21:51:17,"i just found out about wykcoff's method and smart money, i'm so pissed","i've heard about wykcoff before, but i recently stumbled upon it again and looked into in detail and as it relates to forex trading

and what i found out lead me down a rabbit hole that ultimately made me super pissed

first off, smart money are crooks

these are institutions that manipulate the markets in a systematic way, in order to fuck people out of their money repeatedly, like a well oiled machine

they do this through wykcoff's method

wkycoff's method is basically 4 phases: accumulation, uptrend, distribution, downtrend

smart money follows this formula to the letter each and every time they engage in the markets

this is because smart money is made up of institutions, and institutions make up 90% of the trading volume in forex

basically, institutions can do whatever the fuck they want, at any time

they have such high volume, they can literally cause candlesticks to move at will on the price charts

they use this ability to go through the 4 phases of wkycoff's method

they start by accumulating a bunch of the stock when prices are in a downtrend

dumb money, basically every trader on reddit, sees that prices are trending down, so they end up opening sell positions

smart money absorbs all the positions from dumb money

this causes a narrow and boring trading range that lasts DAYS

there is no continuation of the downtrend or trend reversal, it's just a ranging market

but during this time, smart money is accumulating. they are adding onto their stock and getting all of the supply in what looks like a quiet market!

they go even further than that

they use algorithms, and high frequency trading, to periodically push price below the trading range. this causes a bunch of stop loss orders to trigger, at which point smart money immediately buys again, accumulating more

or quite simply, smart money can place MASSIVE sell orders at the bottom of the trading range. sell orders so big that once they get triggered, price literally tumbles down on the price chart

which again triggers a bunch of stop loss orders to trigger. and then again, immediately at this time, smart money buys back all the asset they sold, and they buy back all the new supply that just entered the market due to the stop loss orders

smart money is basically doing liquidity grabs during this accumulation phase to continue their accumulation

finally, once they are done accumulating everything, and they are sure that no one has anymore stock available to sell.. smart money then moves the market upward!

dumb money thought the downtrend would continue, but no, that's not the case

smart money has taken the price upward

once the uptrend has finished, smart money then either decides to reaccumulate or move to the distribution phase..

distribution is the same as accumulation, but in reverse

after distribution, comes the downtrend, and after that, smart money may decide to redistribute, by selling to dumb money all over again

once accumulation or distribution is over, smart money has to start the whole process again if they decide to reaccumulate or redistribute, of getting dumb money to feed them so they can build up their position

this is how smart money manipulates dumb money.. they go through these 4 phases, over and over again

dumb money has no idea they are being played.. they have no knowledge as to what is happening, they just know that they are losing

they see price is going down so they sell, but they are selling to smart money who is accumulating all stock..

smart money can afford to buy everything, smart money can decide what direction they want price to go, and they can make it happen no matter what. because they have the money to do it.. it just takes them time to finally accumulate all the stock before they decide to make their move

smart money moves the market, dumb money has no idea how or why they keep losing

imagine someone just getting owned in a competition over and over, they have no idea why they are losing each time

no one tells them why and they can't see why

so they keep trying again and again, and they just keep losing

that is what smart money is doing to dumb money

it's fucking wild, how blissfully unaware dumb money is

i've seen people on reddit saying they've been trading and losing for years, like 5+ years they've been trading. and still they are losing money..

they are literally dumb money that is spending their life being manipulated by smart money...

this is some dystopian type shit that is going on here

1l7pvqo,2025-06-10,2025-06-10 00:32:44,7 Lessons I’ve Learned After 4 Years Trading Price Action,"I’ve been trading for 4 years now mostly futures, with a focus on price action and supply/demand. I studied Al Brooks, Carmine Rosato, and a bit of Wyckoff and some ICT, but most of what I’ve learned came from screen time, losses, and hundreds of hours spent journaling, backtesting, and reviewing trades.

Here’s what I’ve learned:

**1. Price tells the story before indicators do**  
Every indicator lags. Price doesn’t. Learn to read candles and structure like a language. Just learn from candle to candle and you can use indicators but don't rely on them.

**2. Every level you mark is a potential trap**  
Retail sees support/resistance. Smart money sees liquidity. Think about who’s trapped, not just where price might bounce. Don't try to predict where the price is going to go, just react and ride the wave.

**3. Patience is a position**  
Most of my worst trades came from jumping in early. Waiting for the right entry is a skill that took years to build. This was the hardest thing to master for me.

**4. First test of a zone is often the best**  
Whether it’s a supply or demand zone, that first touch usually has the cleanest reaction. After that, the edge starts to fade. I usually wait for a tap and stop hunt to perform.

**5. Stop trying to predict. Start reacting.**  
You’re not here to forecast price. You’re here to react to what it *does* and manage risk. That shift changed everything for me. Be an **Observer.**

**6. Context > Candle**  
A hammer in an uptrend means nothing. A hammer into a zone of liquidity after a sweep? That’s a setup worth watching. Are we in a bullish or bearish market? have we taken the high or low of the day? content is absolute key.

**7. Don’t underestimate journaling**  
Once I started tracking setups, wins/losses, emotions, and context consistently, my growth exploded. Journaling made this process 10x easier. It replaced my messy notebooks and gave me real insights. I also backtest regularly and review key trades inside the dashboard. I use to print charts, use sticky noys and bunch of notepads, very messy and would not retain anything.

I chart with **TradingView** for higher time frame structure, and use a **footprint chart in Sierra Chart** for order flow and execution detail. I journal every trade and log context, execution, and emotions using **TradeZella**, which has been a huge part of my growth.

1l9ram8,2025-06-12,2025-06-12 12:44:53,5 STAGES OF BECOMING A TRADER,"# STEP 1: “INNOCENT AND BLISSFULLY IGNORANT”

This is the very beginning when you step into trading. You know trading is a good way to make money because you’ve heard stories—about millionaires and all that. Unfortunately, just like when you first started driving, you think it’s easy—until you realize how truly difficult it is. The market goes up and down… What’s the secret in there? Let’s find out!

But soon enough, like the first time you sat behind the wheel, you quickly realize you don’t have a shred of skill to do this. You trade a lot and risk way too much. You open a position, it moves against you, so you close it, open another one in the opposite direction—only for it to move against you again… and on and on. You may see a few early wins, but that’s worse than nothing—it tricks your subconscious into thinking, “Oh, trading is easy.” You start risking even more. You want to get back what you lost, so you begin doubling down on every trade. You win a few times, but mostly you get battered—you lose heavily. You forget that you have no real skill in trading.

This stage typically lasts a few weeks. The market shifts quickly, and you rapidly move into Stage 2.

# STEP 2: “REALIZING YOUR OWN INADEQUACY”

In this stage, you recognize that trading requires a lot—skills, knowledge—and you need to learn. You realize you have no real trading skills, no foundation to make consistent money.

You start buying systems, e‑books, visiting trading websites—all hunting for the “holy grail.” You become a systems tester, switching methods day after day, never sticking long enough to see if they even work. Every time you find some indicator, you trick yourself into thinking it’ll make a difference.

You test systems, use moving averages, Fibonacci lines, support and resistance, pivots, RSI, DMI, ADX, and hundreds more—hoping your magical system will work instantly today. You try to catch tops and bottoms precisely with your indicators, only to realize you’re losing even more, convinced your system is still right.

You see other traders making money, and you wonder why you cannot. You ask countless questions—some so ridiculous they embarrass you later. You come to believe that all profitable traders are liars. “There’s no way they’re winning—if I tried everything I know, why are they winning and I'm not?” But they keep winning day after day, while your account drains.

You're like a stubborn child. Traders give advice, but you ignore it, continue overtrading, even if people call you crazy. You buy signals from “teachers,” but that doesn’t help. No matter how skilled the teacher is, you still lose—because nothing replaces experience, and you still think you “know” it all.

This stage can last a very long time. From casual conversations and personal experience trading, Stage 2 often lasts 1 to nearly 3 years. It’s during this phase you want to quit. Around 60% of new traders drop out within the first 3 months—and that’s good, because if trading were easy, we’d all be millionaires. About 20% stick around a year—and blow their accounts. The remaining 20% endure the full 3 years—and even then, only 5–10% move forward to sustainable profits. These are real numbers, not guesses. Even after three years, it’s hardly smooth. Talk to traders who’ve been doing this 5+ years—none got there fast. There may be exceptions, but I’ve never seen one.

# STEP 3: “THE EUREKA MOMENT”

At the end of Stage 2, you realize that the system isn’t what makes the difference. You discover you can actually make money with a single moving average—nothing else—if you pair it with proper mindset and money management. You start reading about trading psychology, empathizing with characters in those books, and finally you hit that “Eureka” moment.

This moment connects to something deep within you. You suddenly realize that nobody can predict the market a few seconds or even 20 minutes ahead. So you stop worrying about what others think—how news will affect the market. You develop your own approach.

You focus on one system, refine it in your own way, and begin to feel confident in your risk thresholds. You only take trades when your system shows a high probability setup. If a position goes against you, you don’t get emotional—you know you can’t predict, and you quickly close losing trades. The next trade—or the one after—will have a greater chance of winning, because you know your system works.

You stop obsessing over each trade’s outcome and start evaluating performance on a weekly basis. You understand that one bad trade doesn’t mean your system is broken. In a flash you realize the only variable in trading is consistency and discipline—follow your system rules, every single trade, no matter what. In the long run, you’ll come out on top.

You learn about position sizing, leverage, how much to risk per account—you truly *get* it now. You smile, remembering those who warned you a year ago. You weren’t ready then—but you are now. The “Eureka” moment hits when you truly accept that you *cannot predict the market*.

# STEP 4: “CONSCIOUS MASTERY”

Now you trade only on your system’s signals. You approach every trade the same—win or lose. You embrace risk so winning trades can fully develop—because you know your system makes more money overall—and you swiftly exit losing trades so they don’t hurt your account.

At this point, most of your trades end around breakeven. You have winning days and losing days, weeks with +100 pips and weeks at –100 pips—overall, you break even and preserve capital. You know you’re on the right path. You keep thinking about your trading process.

Over time you begin to make slightly more than you lose. You might win 20 pips one day, lose 35 pips the next—and you don’t worry you’ve given back your profits, because you trust you’ll get them back. Soon you’re making consistent profits—25 pips one week, 50 the next—and it goes on. This stage lasts about six months.

# STEP 5: “UNCONSCIOUS COMPETENCE”

Like cooking or driving—each day, you trade and everything happens almost automatically. You perform without thinking. You start taking larger trades, and winning 200 pips in a day no longer excites you more than a single pip.

In an almost magical trading achievement, you’ve mastered your emotions—and now your account grows swiftly. Newbies ask for your advice and actually listen. You see your younger self in their questions. You offer guidance—but you know most will forget it—immature traders, eager for fast riches. A few might reach your level—some fast, some slow—but so many never leave Stage 2. A small minority do.

Now trading is no longer thrilling—it’s actually a bit dull. Once you’re proficient, like any job, it becomes just work. Your time is spent refining your method for maximum profit without increasing risk. The method doesn’t change—it improves. You develop what some call “intuition.”

Now you can proudly say, “I’m a forex trader.” But honestly, it’s just a job—nothing special to broadcast.

Remember: only 5% truly succeed. Why do others fail? Not due to lack of ability—but lack of endurance: inability to shift mindset, adapt, and change mental patterns when circumstances change. Losers want “get‑rich‑quick,” approach the market with fixed beliefs, refuse to see the truth.

I’m glad I entered trading wanting to “get rich fast.” Now I view it as “get rich slow.”

If you’re thinking about quitting, I have one question:  
**“How many years would you invest in college if you knew that, once you graduated, you’d earn a million dollars a year?”**

Take care, and I wish you good luck in your trading.

Year 1-2: Massive losses, constant confusion

Year 3-4: Started journaling, slowed down, started seeig some profitability

Year 5: Locked in consistency and started stacking payouts

Like most traders, I thought the key was in the strategy. I jumped from indicators to price action, to ICT, to SMC, to trend lines, thinking the next system would finally unlock it. But here’s the truth:

It was never about the strategy.

It was about how I executed it.

Once I stopped trying to guess market direction and started reacting to what’s in front of me, things changed. I mark zones. I wait for price to hit those areas. If there’s a clear rejection, I enter. If not, I don’t. No forcing. No FOMO.

Now the only thing I care about? Risk to Reward.

I shoot for 1:2.5 or better.

Win rate sits around 45–50%.

That’s all I need.

You don’t need to be right 70% of the time. You need to be disciplined when you're wrong and maximize when you're right. Most people lose because they cut winners too soon or hold losers too long.

If you’re stuck, here’s what helped me:

Stop switching strategies every week

Focus on a single setup and master it

Set high R:R targets and stick to them

Size down and stay consistent

Journal everything until your edge is obvious

Forget being perfect. Focus on being repeatable.

That’s when trading finally made sense.

1igu860,2025-02-03,2025-02-03 12:15:34,How to win in trading: keep going after everyone else stops,"Hi everyone,

I'm a husband, a dad of five, and a full-time trader.

Making the leap to full-time trading has been quite a journey, and along the way, I’ve picked up some concepts that have helped me navigate the ups and downs.

As I’ve been writing out these ideas for myself, I thought they might hopefully be encouraging to others—whether you're considering the transition to full-time trading or just looking to refine your approach.

**Here's my post:**

Last week, I had coffee with an aspiring trader. The last time we talked, he was bursting with fresh ideas and eager to make his mark in the trading world.

But when I asked how things were going, and if he was still working toward making trading his full-time career, he hesitated.

""Trading was way harder than I expected,"" he said. ""I lost money and decided to stop. I tried stocks and options—options were cool, but I just couldn’t grasp it.

I realized it would take years to get good at this and I’m not ready to invest that kind of time right now. Maybe I’ll try again someday.""

Unfortunately, this reaction is all too common. But why is it the norm for so many?

Yes, the barrier to entry in trading is high—but here’s the thing: so is everything else.

For example: the average acceptance rate for Ivy League schools is under 4%. Only the top 8-10% of realtors make six figures. Just 5% of all Amazon sellers generate over $1 million in revenue. The reality is that the barrier to success in *any* field is high.

I don’t think trading is anything extraordinary. It’s not some mysterious ""boogeyman"" of business that's harder than other career paths. I believe it’s totally achievable for the person who truly wants it and is willing to put in the work—just like earning an Ivy League education, excelling in real estate, or hitting $1 million in Amazon sales. It all comes down to the individual and their commitment.

That’s why it’s frustrating to see new traders give in to self-doubt. So much potential gets derailed by short-term discouragement.

Today, I want to offer some encouragement. A career in trading isn’t just worth pursuing—it’s absolutely possible when built on the right foundation.

Let’s flip the script on this undeserved doubt and push your trading journey forward.

# The big problem with short term thinking

When I talk to struggling traders, or those hoping to transition to full-time, there’s a common theme: they view trading as a fast and easy path to riches. But in reality, it’s just like any other vocation or business.

Think about it—when else is taking the long road ever seen as a problem? Plumbers, dentists, real estate agents, and restaurant owners don’t have an issue with putting in the time and effort to get where they want to go.

What if we as traders adopted the same mindset?  
Trading is a business, after all.

What if, instead of thinking like most new traders who focus on days and weeks, we shifted to thinking in terms of months and years?

Whenever I face a decision, I like to ask myself: ""If I choose this path, what’s the alternative?"" In trading, the alternative to long-term thinking is, of course, short-term thinking—and that’s where the real problems start. This mindset can lead to things like:

* **Rushing to make a profit right away.** What if a restaurant tried this? They might cut corners by using cheap ingredients, skimp on marketing, skip employee training, and ignore the fundamentals—leading to few, if any, return customers.
* **Making quick decisions with large amounts of money, without the experience to back it up.** What if a new plumber took out a huge loan for tons of equipment and work trucks, without any real customers or business experience? Wouldn’t it make more sense to use what he has, build a customer base, and then figure out what tools he actually needs?
* **Jumping from one strategy to the next, without giving them enough time.** What if a real estate agent, looking for leads, tried knocking on doors in a local neighborhood for a few days, then gave up to focus on SEO for their website, just because they didn’t get immediate results? Had they stuck with the door-knocking strategy a little longer, they might have seen a lead come through and realized it was working.
* **Starting each business day without a clear process or routine.** Imagine a local dentist who had no set schedule, no patient records, and no clear steps for addressing patient needs. It would be chaos.

Notice a theme yet? *(Good things take time!)*  
Viewing trading as a long-term endeavor is what truly makes the difference.

# But what if you’re still stuck?

I know what you might be thinking: ""That sounds great, but I'm still scared. I’m afraid of starting and failing. I’m not in the right financial position to start a business, let alone trading.""

And that’s okay. You’re not alone. Every single trader, no matter their experience, feels that type of fear. Every day.

My heart still skips a beat when I see the clock ticking down to the opening bell, even after years of trading. Millions of people—wannabe traders and elite fund managers alike—feel the same way. That fear doesn’t disappear overnight. It may never go away completely, no matter what business you’re in.

But here’s my encouragement to you:

What you want is just on the other side of the unknown.

Every day you take a small step into the unknown, every time you take another trading rep, or make a small process improvement, they all add to your confidence to keep going. Because remember, you’re thinking long-term, just like a real business.

This is how you win.

# It's time to win

I know—words are nice—but how do you actually move forward? What are some practical steps you can use to move forward in your trading journey?

Let me put it this way: If you wanted to start a plumbing business, how would you ensure success, stay profitable, and keep going even when others have stopped?

1. **Start with the basics.** Use new information to help lower fear of the unknown. First, you’d figure out exactly what you need to start—certifications, tools, insurance, and so on. You’d probably watch a few YouTube videos from different people to get an overview of what it's like. (I really appreciate SMB Capital’s free trading content - no need to pay for anything, just learn all you can.)
2. **Get hands-on practice.** Next, as an aspiring plumber, you’d start practicing with small jobs around the house or for close family, just to get those reps in and learn what it really takes. (This could look like taking small reps, I’m a big believer in one-share trades. Buy and sell one share only, until you have the data needed to show you where you’re profitable and you can start to scale.)
3. **Track everything.** As you go, you might write everything down. Maybe film or take pictures of each plumbing job so you can study them later. You’d track what you enjoy, what areas are low-stress and easy for you, and what mistakes you make—along with specific ways to fix them. (I like using Notion as a free way to start tracking things. Also Edgewonk is a great low-cost option.)
4. **Build a routine.** You then start forming a daily routine. You’d maybe go to class to learn the trade in the morning, do homework in the afternoon, and then maybe work on a small jobs for practice at night or on weekends. You’d then make adjustments each day, noting things like: *""I did poorly on my last exam because I stayed up too late. I’ll go to bed at 9 pm to focus better in class, as well as have more energy for my plumbing jobs.""*(In trading, this is what’s known as your “process”. Your routine that you follow, which you know gives you the best chance for success each day.)
5. **Repeat and improve.** The key in any business is repetition. You’d keep following the same steps every day until you get so good that you either have the pick of which plumbing company to work for, or, start your own business. Then assume it would take one to three years to get there. (This is when you find your “edge” — a repeatable trade setup that you know gives you positive expected value over time.)
6. **Bonus.** Along the way, you might only buy what you really need and try to practice frugality—no loans, using your own truck and tools, adding only as needed. This keeps the risk low while you learn and build your business. (This means keeping your costs and overhead low, in order to preserve and save up capital to trade with. And no need to overspend on fancy software or tools in the beginning— the focus should be on the fundamentals.)

# The bottom line

Let the aspiring trader at the beginning of this post serve as a reminder.

When it comes to building a trading career, you’re faced with two paths:

One path is focused on the short term, driven by immediate results and quick wins. This often leads to frustration and burnout, causing many to quit before they’ve given themselves a real chance to succeed.

The other path—which offers a much higher probability of success—is grounded in long-term thinking. It’s about committing to continuous learning, persevering through challenges, and allowing time to develop your skills and strategy.

Success in trading—or in any field—isn’t owned by the smartest, the luckiest, or even the most naturally talented. It belongs to those who *stay in the game*.

The truth is, every master trader, every successful entrepreneur, and every top performer started where you are: uncertain, inexperienced, and full of doubt. The only difference? They decided to push through and embrace the long game, and to build their foundation one step at a time.

So, what will you choose? Will you let short-term struggles define you? Or will you shift your mindset, commit to the process and lifestyle, and give yourself the time needed to truly succeed?

1m91nwu,2025-07-25,2025-07-25 11:07:36,Read This Before You Tell Anyone You’re a Trader,"**Most traders only think about psychology in terms of executing trades. But the truth runs much deeper.**

Trading is a career; not a game.

**This has practical and personal lessons from pain**

Your friends, families and communities all have subtle (and not so subtle) effects on your mindset, motivation and your chances of long term success.

Most traders don't realise how much their environment, both virtual and in person, weighs them down before it's too late. Most quit. Others waste years. It's a silent killer.

**This post breaks it all down (8-9 Minutes reading time according my medium article)**

* How to handle even small trading successes without inviting pressure or doubt
* The social mistakes that silently sabotage your mindset
* The traps caused by poor social boundaries.
* Clear, actionable solutions to protect your focus and peace
* How to build a private, powerful environment that actually helps you win

**Read it once and you'll remember it forever.**

**This is a critical piece on trading psychology. Takes less than 10m to read, over an hour to write and years to learn.**

# Most traders only think about psychology in terms of executing trades. But the truth tells a different story.

# 1. Social mistakes every trader should avoid

Trading is a game of numbers and averages. It relies on the outcome of many, many trades.

Why tell someone how your trades are going when you have only placed 30? One of the biggest mistakes traders make socially is letting people know that they are planning on making this absurd amount of money and they have this trading strategy that will do it for them. Fast forward 3 years, and they continue to let people know. - Ali

As much as some traders try to appear humble about their intent, we all trade for money.

There’s nothing wrong with having that attitude. Veiling it with “I don’t trade for the money” or “don’t trade for the money” isn’t helpful without context. - Ron

# Personal Experiences with this mistake (We’ve made them) - Ron

**I used to talk about trading and was overt with my small successes when younger.**

When I was a teenager in school (around 16), I made close to £200 in one night on GBPUSD whilst sleeping out of luck. I was ecstatic; I told friends, my parents, and even my teachers. Luckily I was too young for it to be consequential. People probably didn’t take me seriously, so it wasn’t so consequential (luckily).

**For most people they’ve done something similar**

Doing this optimistic talk even with parents or your significant other creates performance anxiety. People will start to ask you, “How is your trading going?” or get concerned for you when they don’t understand it’s just another drawdown. 

**When I was 17-18, I had small wins here and there, short periods of profitability followed by devastation.** 

When I was profitable, it was met with scepticism. When I was struggling, I was looked down upon.

By the time I was 18-19, I understood this. I learnt these lessons the hard way. Many don’t.

When I made my first life-changing money in my trading (£30k was lifechanging at the time), my family didn’t know for over a year. By then it was permanent. I didn’t flaunt.

**I set social boundaries on asking about my trading and explained why.** 

I’ve made and lost thousands in university lectures and labs and didn’t say a thing.

# Don’t subject yourself to this.

**I remember my grandmother saying to me,** “Make sure you don’t lose it all.” “Are you still gambling?”,

**My mother said something along the lines of,** “I see you’re trying a lot with this. I don’t want to be mean, but why don’t you get a real job?” Ouch 

**And my Father cornering me and questioning my goals** “What are you going to do? What’s your goal? What job are you going to get?”

This is the easiest way to get performance anxiety-induced stress or feel demoralised, and it was all preventable by keeping my mouth shut, but I didn’t.

**It’s not that your family doesn’t like you; it’s that they don’t understand trading.** 

They don’t understand it or believe in it. A lot just see trading as gambling.

**They do it because they care not to destroy you**

These effects are often subconscious and still weigh you down.

I’m telling you now, if my family (especially my mother) knew I was in a £100k drawdown when I was (>130k USD), she would freak out, and things would be tough even post-recovery. Don’t even make me imagine it. It’d be beyond unpleasant.

**It’s not about hiding what you do; it’s about having peace in your environment whilst performing.**

# 1.2 Telling or encouraging family or friends to trade - Ron

I want to keep this short. If you do this, you’ll create unrealistic expectations because of stimulation from your successes or retail social media BS.

In UK college (16-18), when someone approached me with TradingView open on my phone

I was silly enough to tell him that I was trading profitably at the time and talked about it.

**They’ll get clingy, fast. Especially when you’re “profitable”** 

This is noise that you can’t afford to have in your development stage. It slows you down. You can still run while wearing a 10 kg/20 lb weighted vest if you’re conditioned; it’s still noticeably harder. 

Even when full-time. If my distant family or friends ask me, I still play it down and pretend like I do something else. It’s not worth your sanity.

When you buy luxury goods such as a Rolex watch, you don’t need to explain, flaunt, or post it. Don’t get pushed into revealing what you don’t want to; some are persistent or manipulative.

**If you want a trading partner such as me and Ali**

Make sure you both work efficiently and are both traders. Networking is available in data driven groups. Have high standards for traders you talk to. It matters.

**The thing to do instead is play down what you do or, at most, say you’re just looking into it. I know it feels good to talk about making money, but the best answer is no.**

If they witness you trading live, just say it’s a demo account.

If a person in public approaches you (has happened countless times to me and Ali), play it down and say invest in the S&P 500. Do not waste your time.

Listen to me! We’ve made these mistakes. Don’t. Do. It!

It’s best to be quiet; it’s far easier to succeed under these conditions.

If people don’t know you trade, it’s even better. 

# Keep Quiet and set boundaries.

The short-term dopamine spikes aren’t worth it. **Do not confuse this for humility. You have a positive P&L to register.**

# 2. Your environment for growth and why it matters: Trading Groups

Sharpen Your Edge by Choosing Your Circle - Ron

**These aren’t opinions. This is behavioural psychology innate in us.**

**If you’re serious about having a real trading career, you’ll take action on this.**

***You owe yourself more.***

**One of the biggest reasons smart people don’t make it in trading isn’t a lack of skill. It’s the lack of environmental control.**

Most of you are still hanging around Communities full of entertaining but directionless chatter, i.e., waffle.

You’re soaking in the opinions of people who haven’t built anything, haven’t refined anything, and haven’t proven anything beyond a few lucky MT4/MT5 or Journal screenshots

**Now I need you to think about this logically.**

If someone spends a lot of their time with smokers, even if they tell themselves, “I’ll never smoke; that’s not me,” odds are eventually they will, even if it’s just trying one. 

Or testing that one logically flawed trading concept…

**It’s not always a direct influence. It’s subtle. It shifts your baseline without you even noticing it’s innate in us; we are human beings.**

You can like the cigarette; you could get positive backtest data on something baseless. Is that noise worth it if you don’t want to smoke? Is that noise worth it if you want to succeed in trading?

**You might not copy trades. But you’ll start absorbing the bad reasoning.** 

The loose discipline or approach. Shallow risk thinking. And broken retail logic.

And without realising it, you’ve let noise interfere with your trading once again - That gets expensive.

**Here’s the uncomfortable truth about most trading communities**

The moment you decided to get serious about trading. Truly not serious

You have to choose to block out negative influences. That means talking to and surrounding yourself with sharp, structured thinkers. People with systems, data, and discipline. Not just good vibes and memes. I know it’s comfortable, but that was never enough. 

Remember If you’re serious about having a real trading career, you’ll take action on this.

**You owe yourself more.**

Now we get it. You probably like some of the people in these groups, and that’s completely fine. Stay in touch with the smart ones if you want. 

That’s what I did with Ali.

During your development phase while you’re still building your initial edges and refining your trading psychology, it’s important to shelter your eyes from laymen - You need to cut the noise. 

**You need direction, not noise and stimulation.**

Because you expose yourself to logical flaws, emotional responses, and low-effort posts and thinking, the more that standard becomes yours psychologically. 

**Remember that this isn’t an opinion; it’s behavioural psychology**

# 3. Ego

There is both a social and a personal consequence of ego. The focus will be placed on the social aspect, as that forms the basis of this document.

Traders have egos. We have seen this in almost everything. Sometimes traders struggle to accept other trader's ideas, and they will always want to impose their thought processes even if they have yet to show any sort of system or returns. This is a problem because most traders lose. 

People in europe are forced to constantly see most clients lose money on their broker but they still believe they aren't going to be that guy, never underestimate the ego of man.

Even based on probability, what are the chances that any one trader with an unchecked ego has managed to crack trading? What are the chances that one trader has figured out everything to do with the market? **Likely less than a few percent.**

A trader's emotion is linked to their ego as well.

They feel an emotional attachment to their current trading style, which they have probably developed over the years. Unfortunately, most traders lose money (easily near or above 95%), so the question a trader must ask themselves is if their trading style is the way it should be done. Just based on statistics, almost everyone is not doing it correctly. Yes, they may have the underlying understanding, but their application is lacking, and there are things they have not yet defined explicitly. For instance, traders think psychology is detrimental to trading, but that is not trading. That is gambling. **The attachment to any existing style of trading has to be removed.** 

We feel no attachment to any strategy or style, which is why we managed to progress and write so many documents grounded in logic.                                                                       

Without this lack of an attachment, we would have been stuck on trendlines and crayons on a chart for the past few years. We realised early on that the only way to do this is to do what nobody else does properly and to have our knowledge so precise that it can be compiled without logical flaws, as we have done with the documents. - Ali

# Being too humble won’t work. Delusion won’t either.

The only way to make proper returns is by understanding and being able to apply everything from the chart itself to the analysis behind the data, properly, with no logical flaws. - Ali

# As clear as I can be

If you want a real shot at this, leave directionless trading groups. For now. Cut ties with trading environments that dilute your sentience, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. Immerse yourself where precision is normal. Where deep work is respected, not dismissed. Where sharp thinking is the minimum

**When you go full-time one day, and many of you will (if you've read this far),** you’ll likely lose that desire for old noise anyways. Entertainment stops being the goal when real mastery in profitable strategy design and trading becomes the pursuit.

Until then, give yourself the best chance. Choose your environment the way you’d choose your mentor. Intentionally.

I’m a full time trader and I hope you guys find this helpful.

To explain this in great detail would take hours upon hours however I’ve wrote up a simplified description to make it digestible.

“We do not trade ideas we trade set ups”

As professional traders you should not be trading ideas, you should be trading sets ups. Something that you can measure, replicate, improve upon and learn from. Not random events.

Here’s an example of how a novice traders mind may work:

You see an article pop up about a Tesla car that was on auto pilot and crashed into a stationary car causing injury to both the driver and the passenger. Your instant thoughts are “This could effect Tesla’s stock price” and you put it on your watchlist for the day. Now the issue with this is this the specific event Is not measurable. The way in which the stock reacts will be random and you won’t be able to use the stats for any other trades. Making the event a coin flip and therefore a gamble.

Focus on set ups not ideas. It’s ok to have an idea for the set up but the set up HAS TO BE THERE.

Now lets get straight to it.

What is an all time high breakout?

1. The answer is simple. This is when a stock breaks out into a new ATH.

Why is this such a good set up to take?

1. Because everybody who’s EVER brought the stock is now in the GREEN “no reason to sell” and everybody who’s shorting the stock is now red “May look to cover”

Here’s how it works:

A lot of professional traders, myself included, love the all time high break outs for many reasons. The main being the explosive moves it can often provide. Due to this a lot of day traders, swing traders, investors, funds and algorithms will monitor the market for these potential plays. Meaning they’re often on the buying side. This is why you can see what appears to be a stock doing very little yet the moment it trickles over it’s previous ATH high it can rally for days.

It’s called “buying the breakout”

You see the market is run on mostly Human emotion, we know this but very few understand how that works.

The reason most people lose money in the market is they are untrained and do not have the discipline to handle their own barbaric emotions.

Here’s why that’s important.

For this example we’ll call the company $STONKS it’s been on the market for 3 years and it’s current all time high is $10. Some bad news comes out and the stock gaps down to $8 causing people to panic sell and the stock to drop even further. Over the next 12 months it drops to a low of $5 until finally reclaiming to today at $9.90. It’s been consolidating between $9 and $9.90 for 10 days.

For the past year there has been a lot of people bag holding. Those who brought at the previous all time high have seen their investment drop by 50% and slowly recover. In between this time a lot of people have cut their loses, some have averaged down, new investors have “brought the dip” and we’re now back to where we was a year ago.

Now we have a few things at play here.

1. Those who rode through the entire year, the 50% drop and who haven’t sold now at break even clearly have no intention to sell.
2. Out of those who brought the dip some will have sold and some and still holding onto their shares even though the price has been stagment the past 10 days.
3. For the past 10 days people have been buying consistently and have been paying $9 or above for the stock. Showing a growing interest and price acceptance at these prices.
4. People who shorted the stock are now either at break even or at a loss.
5. Anybody new who wants to purchase some shares has currently got to pay all time high prices.

The longer we consolidate at these price the more powerful the move can become, why you ask?

Because it has more chance of the float being rotated. Understand that the first time $STONKS went up to $10 1 year ago the average price paid by an investor may have been $3 which meant a lot of profit taking occurred. When the bad news hit a lot of those investors jumped ship. Causing more supply than demand and therefore the price to drop.

Fast forward to today and the longer it consolidates above $9 the high the AVG price held will be. When this happens the buyers are literally sitting on basically no loss nor no gain giving them no reason to sell.

For those unaware, if you short a stock the only way to get out for a loss is to cover your position. This in turn means “buying the stock”. Creating more buying pressure. Short positions will often risk in this scenario the all time high. Meaning if it breaks they start to cover. If they start to cover it increases buying pressure and with buying pressure increasing the stock moves up (extremely simple explanation).

So we as traders recognise the stock is setting up for an ATH breakout and here’s what we do.

We decide we want to risk $2,000 in the stock.

We buy $500 worth at 9.20 known as a starter position and we wait.

A week goes by and it’s still chopping between this range. A press release then comes out (a bullish catalyst). The market opens are $STONKS see’s a huge 15 minute candle at open. The largest amount of volume it’s seen in months. On that volume it breaks $10 and instantly jumps to $10.50.

We managed to get our other $1,500 in at $10.20 bringing our average to roughly $9.90 a share. We move our stop loss to below the previous ATH with some breathing room AKA $9.50/share.

Everybody who now has shares in this stock prior to today is in the green, they’re estactic. Those who held through the entire past year and refused to sell are now mentioning how they’re in profit on an investment they made to work colleagues.

Short positions are now aware there’s no resistance and start covering “buying shares”. FOMO buyers who are “trading the news” (not a set up ;) ) are now buying in. Professional swing traders are buying the break out, day traders are buying the opening drive. Everybody is buying..

The stock closes at $12 marking a 25% daily gain. Barrons, CNBC, MSN all post above how $STONKS rallied into ATH due to X,Y,Z

The following morning the stock gaps up. People are hyped, pre market goes wild and opens at $16.

We instantly sell half…

The stock is extremely extended as new investors flurry in, we sell them some more. There’s now 25% left of our original investment.

We move our stop loss under PM support and go to focus on the next set up. The same set up. Something we can measure. Something we take day in day out.

If the stock goes to 20 then we don’t get annoyed we could have missed out on further profits as it wasn’t our trade.

The stock taps 20, massive selling occurs and settles around 14. Where it stays for months, consolidationg. Meanwhile, we’re just waiting for it to once again set up.

So how do I find these trades?

I use trading view, I create a list of sectors such as EVs, Solar, Tech, AI etc etc and I scan through each day. Literally just flick through. Is the stock near it’s ATH? If not, I go to the next and the next.

My indicators are as follows.

Volume Profile, RSI (for the daily only)

That’s it.

If you master just this single set up you can make money consistently. Why? Because it’s measurable, you can improve upon it. You can learn from each event but most importantly you have a set plan where the market is in your favour for the outcome to work. Never under estimate human emotion.

I post all my trades on Instagram at the moment but I’ll look into posting my watchlist here too if it’ll help you guys.

I even went to the extent of creating my own Trading Business Name and Logo just to get my mind to believe in it. It has tremendously helped my mental state during my trades and I'm sure it would help at least 8/10 people here

1jiyl99,2025-03-24,2025-03-24 14:54:15,Here’s what I realised watching my students trade,"Hi, 

To give some context - I’m a trader and I teach people on the side and help traders become profitable. At least that’s what I thought until I watched my students trade their accounts to get more into depth of what’s working out and what’s not working out and here’s what I found - 

Analysis - after a lot of work and studying and practice most students were able to get an easy grasp of the market and start trading following what I tell them - they start gaining profits the first few days. 

Trading - but here’s the reality check - if they end up losing a trade (happens in every single strategy / trader due to market conditions) they are not able to take it. 

What do they do? 

1. Over leverage to get back 
2. Start being greedy to get more trades because they KNOW the strategy works and can make money 
3. End up taking low quality trades without analysing 
4. Get fearful to enter good trades so they exit before it can perform 
5. Then take bad trades again 
6. This loop continues to repeat. 

Little did I know that no matter how much I can teach them about the markets - they can never make money because of “losses”. They just can’t get over it. That’s just one thing. 

There are traders with a gambling mindset - they just are like “f*** it” let’s see what happens. Never works. And the other thing? Oh I’m just a good person why does the market continue to treat me bad and it’s brutal when I put so much effort into it? 

Think about this for a minute - if the market started “caring” for you will it even be a market for everyone? 

I can firmly say one thing about trading with experience teaching, how I got profitable, watching traders struggle and my own struggles - losses. If you can’t embrace, accept, enjoy, love it, or just be ok with it - truly from how you feel about it and think about it - no matter how amazing you are as an analyst in the market - there is always a chance of you losing all your money in the markets. 

This is just the tip of the iceberg - there’s also insane greed when it comes to risk management and fearful SLs and “giving it breathing space” SL. Like literally anything and everything to convey yourself to make money when the market follows its own damn rules!!! 

There is an insane amount of real psychological work that’s required to become a profitable trader and that’s something no one talks about. This is why even the smartest people you’d know will lose money in the markets and they just call it a gambler’s space. No. It requires you to see money as a resource and nothing else. Very few can achieve that and market teaches you that - people just choose to ignore that fact and try harder to make money when your own mind turns on you again and again.

it's difficult mentally, conceptually, and in terms of execution

just way too much demand placed on the average person

most people that get into trading probably don't even want to study something like wyckoff methodology or read any book on trading

they want to just jump right in and do something stupid, like buy when price crosses a moving average, or sell when there is a big red candle

that's what 99% of people want to do lol

only like 1% would bother even reading the books and studying

and on top of that, there's still the psychological and risk management compontent that also needs to be on point

and above all, a decent IQ level is needed to actually trade in real time and make decisions. to be able to understand the market and adapt when things don't go your way. allowing you to hold onto your profits and cut losses early

that takes a tremedous amount of skill, understanding, and IQ. ESPCIALLY if one wants to do that over a long period of time and for a living as a full time job. it's extremely difficult

yet the guys here don't even have the brain cells to read a reddit post or form any type of intelligent thought as to how the markets move

they read stuff like this and think ""hurr, i see green candle, time to buy""

These concepts provide an insane amount of value and if I could start my trading career over I would learn these concepts.

1is0nzp,2025-02-17,2025-02-17 20:19:58,The 5 Biggest Changes That Made Me Profitable,"
For a long time, I couldn’t stay consistent in trading. I had the knowledge, the setups, and the technicals but I kept losing money because of my own bad habits.

After making these 5 major changes, my trading completely transformed:

1️⃣ No Trading Before 9:45 AM – Here’s Why

I used to jump into trades as soon as the market opened—and I kept getting slapped. Then I realized:
-Pre-9:45 is a trap – Impatient traders get in too early, and market makers exploit them.
-Stop hunts and fake moves – Price loves to manipulate early traders before making the real move.
- Now I wait – I don’t even think about pressing buy or sell before 9:45 AM. Instead, I watch how price reacts and set up for high-probability trades.

2️⃣ I Only Take 2 Trades Per Session (Win or Lose, That’s It)

I used to fire off 20+ trades a day, chasing every little move. The result? More losses, more stress, and overexposure to the market.
-Now I have 2 bullets per session.
- If I lose both, I’m done—no revenge trading, no forcing.
-This forces me to wait for the best setups instead of taking low-quality trades.

3️⃣ Less Is More – I Went from 20+ Trades a Day to 2-3 Trades a Week

Before, I was trading every single day, taking 17-20 trades daily. But then I realized:
- More trades = More exposure = More risk
- Overtrading = More chances to make emotional mistakes
-Now I only trade 2-3 times a week, waiting for perfect setups. My results? Way higher win rate, less stress, and more control.

4️⃣ Be Careful What You Consume on Social Media

I used to scroll through Twitter, YouTube, and Discord, seeing traders post huge $30K+ wins. It gave me the illusion that I should be making big money every day.
- Social media warps reality. Most people don’t show their losses.
-Following random trades = No edge. You need your own system.
- I started filtering what I watch and only focus on content that actually helps me grow.

5️⃣ Fitness & Diet – How It Affects Trading

This was a game changer. How can you expect to be precise in trading when:
- You’re always tired from bad sleep.
- Your blood pressure is high from a bad diet.
- You can’t focus because you never exercise.

- I started working out, eating clean, and following a structured routine.
-My mind is clear, focused, and sharp.
- My discipline in fitness carried over into my trading.

1k7od95,2025-04-25,2025-04-25 11:53:19,Trading is Like a Drug. Here's My 3-Year Journey Fighting It,"In my years doing trading, I’ve realized:  
**Trading is like a drug.**

In my first year and a half, I was an addict.

* Always glued to the charts.
* Always checking my phone.
* Trading 10 different forex pairs and stocks.
* Always wanting to be “in the market”—even late at night.
* Revenge trading, overtrading, blowing accounts.

Of course... I lost a lot of money.

Then came the second phase:  
I tried to clean it up.

* I narrowed down to just 3 pairs.
* I only traded during specific hours. But even then—revenge trades still slipped in. Overtrading still happened. I learned a lot—but I was still leaking money.

And now, finally, this last year:

* I only trade **one instrument.**
* I journal **everything**—money results **and** emotional results—every single day.
* I have a real **trading plan**.
* I know **exactly** when to enter and exit.
* My strategy is **clear and repeatable**.

And guess what?  
I’m finally consistently profitable—**and growing** every month.

Are there still emotional slips sometimes? Yes.  
But they’re rare now—and nowhere near the chaos I lived in before.

If you’re new to this: **Trading will ruin your life if you can’t control your emotions.**  
But if you tame it—if you respect the discipline—  
It becomes the closest thing to a money-printing machine you’ll ever have.

Stay strong. Stay clean.

But instead of quitting, I treated it as a career and realized trading was bigger than charts. It humbled me and forced me to rebuild discipline in every area of life: gym, diet, faith, mindset, sleep, habits. Without those, I couldn’t stay consistent on the charts.

Now, I’m not rich, and I don’t pretend to be a guru. But I’ve had a few payouts already, and more importantly, I’ve proven to myself that consistency outside trading directly impacts results inside trading.

I’m planning to start documenting this journey publicly. Not signals, not “get rich quick,” just the real process of building discipline, faith, and trading together.

1le61kx,2025-06-17,2025-06-17 22:36:02,"After 8 years and countless blown up accounts, some advice for people who keep losing","When I started trading Bitcoin futures 8 years ago, I thought the goal was to find the magic indicator, the holy grail that would call tops and bottoms. I spent many years bouncing between MACD, RSI, Fibonacci, moving averages, trying to make sense of it all. At one point, my chart looked like a colorful disaster. The more indicators I stacked, the more confused I became.

Eventually, I wiped enough accounts to realize it wasn’t about indicators. It was about understanding how price moves. I don’t mean patterns like flags and triangles I mean real movement, real intent. Why did price explode from this level? Why did it reject from that one? Who’s on the other side of the trade, and what are they trying to do?

The two biggest concepts that shifted how I trade were Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) and Order Blocks. Once I started noticing how often price would shoot up or drop down aggressively and then later come back to fill inthat area, it started to click. Price isn’t random it’s cleaning up its mess. I started focusing less on chasing and more on waiting for price to return to those areas. Just being patient and letting the chart breathe changed everything.

Same with Order Blocks when you learn to identify the real ones (the ones that cause breaks of structure), it’s like unlocking a map. You start seeing where the smart money is probably entering. You stop blindly entering mid-range and start positioning around where decisions are made.

Supply and demand was another one. Sounds basic, but when you really understand it, it’s all you need. Why does price react so violently to certain levels? Why do consolidations explode and come back later? It’s not a coincidence. Price is doing what it’s supposed to do it’s just that most people don’t wait long enough to see it.

The hardest part of trading wasn’t learning strategy. It was learning patience. Emotional control. Risk management. I had blown up more than 40-50 accounts in the first few years already. My savings went to 0. I almost became homeless and had dark negative thoughts about myself. I used to curse myself for ever getting involved into something like this where 90% of the population end up losing everything they own.

My family supported me during that time and i remember how tough that spot was. I would never wish something like that even on my worst enemy. 

I’m sharing this because I know a lot of people are getting into trading hoping to flip a small account overnight. I’ve been there.  we all want freedom, fast. But trading isn’t fast. It’s a skill, and it rewards patience more than speed.

If you’re in the early stages just focus on market structure, FVGs, OBs, and risk. You don’t need more indicators. You need time, and a method that you can stick with. That’s really it.

i have seen many people end up becoming homeless because of trading. Please do not be one of them. Do everything you can to find the right way to trade or if you can't do it then be honest with yourself drop it completely. It really is a brutal zero sum game. 

Hope this helps someone.

EDIT : Just posted a video on this subreddit where i explain today's btc trade in a step by step fashion. I ended up closing it early but it went to my tp an hour later lol. Waiting for the mods to approve the post. Hope it helps out some people as i would never wish the negative consequences of trading on even my worst enemies.

1nxmcfl,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 02:12:23,I Journaled Every Single Trade for 1 Year… Here’s What I Found,"After a full year of journaling every single trade, here’s what the data showed me:



https://preview.redd.it/9lvk9lp4e1tf1.png?width=1755&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a35a21423b7a80176d8d5f079a30bb674679c61

Win rate: 39%



Average R: 2.42R



Net P/L: $30,847



Largest win: $3,050



Largest loss: -$1,137



The equity curve wasn’t perfect, but the growth was steady and “linear-ish.” It wasn’t luck, it was data + discipline.



Here are 5 things journaling taught me:



1. You don’t need a high win rate, risk/reward does the heavy lifting.

For most of the year my win rate sat below 40%. If I judged my trading on win % alone, I would’ve quit months ago. But journaling proved the math: with a 2.42R average, my winners more than covered my losers. It only takes a handful of clean setups executed with size to make a month profitable, even if most trades are small scratches or losers. Now also introducing a new ORB setup too which is around 45% winrate and 2R fixed so it should be interesting



2. Losing streaks are predictable and survivable if you know your edge.

When you track every trade, you can see exactly how long your average red streak lasts. For me, the data showed clusters of 4-6 losing trades in a row were normal. Once I understood that, I stopped spiraling emotionally after 3 losses and could calmly stick to the plan. Journaling turns drawdowns from something emotional into something measurable.



3. Certain times of year/sessions perform better, market cycles matter.

Over hundreds of trades, it became clear that not all market environments are equal. Summer chop dragged down my expectancy, while fall/winter trends lifted it back up. Even within the day, certain hours consistently underperformed. Knowing this helps me conserve energy and avoid forcing trades in low-probability cycles.



4. Tracking expectancy gives confidence when P/L fluctuates.

My expectancy averaged $77.9 per trade. That number became a compass. On days or even weeks where I was red, I could zoom out and know that if I just executed another 100 trades with discipline, the expectancy would play out. Without journaling, it’s too easy to let short-term noise make you abandon a strategy that’s statistically sound. Changed through bearish and bullish cycles also can be supoer scray.



5. The numbers don’t lie. Emotions do.

Before journaling, I always “felt” like I was better or worse than I actually was. Reviewing the data crushed those illusions. Trades I thought were my best setups actually had negative expectancy. Patterns I ignored ended up being my most profitable. The journal doesn’t care about feelings, it’s a mirror of your edge in cold, hard numbers.



https://preview.redd.it/v2cato5be1tf1.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=93856892f2e8709af54259384d6783eb55d1b72b

Journaling exposes your blind spots. I know which trades to size into, which to cut, and how long I can expect drawdowns to last. That’s how you survive this game long enough to let compounding do its work.



So my question to you is, do you know your results this clearly? Do you know what to expect in your market cycles?

Waited for only A+ setups. Forced myself to sit on my hands until it was obvious.

Stopped watching every tiny candle. Zoomed out and respected the bigger picture.

Set alerts and walked away. No staring contests with the screen.

Made peace with missing moves. FOMO will make you broke faster than anything else.

Pre-marked all key levels before the open and reviewed everything inside TradeZella after the session.

Traded only during my best hours. No random late-day trades just because I was bored.

Cut trades fast when they invalidated. No hoping, no praying, just execution.

Focused on quality over quantity. One good trade > five mediocre ones every time.

Treated cash as a position. No trade is better than a bad trade.

1nmx0to,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 12:50:01,5 Years In: The Advice I Wish Someone Gave Me On Day One,"I’ve been trading full-time for  2 years, started trading 5 years ago. Along the way, I’ve blown accounts, passed and lost prop firm challenges, had incredible months, and then been humbled the very next week. I primarily trade futures and stocks, but these lessons apply no matter what market you’re in.



1) Fewer Trades, Better Trades

My worst periods came from feeling like I needed to be in the market constantly. The reality is that most price action is just noise, or at least noise to YOU. The edge shows up only a handful of times each week. My best months came from taking fewer than 20 trades and letting the rest pass.



2) Keep Your Playbook Simple

When I started, my charts looked like Times Square, indicators stacked everywhere. That only led to hesitation and confusion. What finally worked was cutting it all down to a short, boring playbook: clean levels, liquidity cues, structure, and a couple of repeatable entries. Same markets, same times, same setups. Very very boring, which is good in the markets.



3) Risk First, Always

Every account I destroyed had the same cause: I ignored risk and moved stops, oversized or tried to “let it work.” Now I define my maximum loss per trade and per day. I place my stop where the trade is invalid and respect it. Capital is ammunition, you only get so much. Don’t waste it trying to prove you’re right. Also one of the reasons I could not make it in options trading is because yyou just never know the exact amount you can make.



4) Journaling Is Where Growth Happens

I used to think bad days were random. Journaling proved otherwise. When I started logging my trades with context, entry, exit, and emotions, patterns became obvious. I was revenge trading after losses, taking boredom trades late in the morning, and cutting winners during news. Writing it down forced me to face the truth and improve. I started with manual journaling but then moved to software years later because when you just write down stuff in your notebook, its really hard for the stats or the lessons you need to see to be availble to you quickly.



5) Protect Your Headspace

Trading money you can’t afford to lose is a fast way to ruin both your account and your mental health. If your rent or grocery money is on the line, you will cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and chase bad setups. Trade small, separate trading capital from living expenses, and make sure red days don’t control your mood for 24 hours.



6) Screen Time Beats Guru Time

Videos and books can teach you the basics, but real progress comes from watching price move in real time, replaying sessions, and backtesting your setups. Intuition isn’t luck, it’s thousands of hours of screen time.



7) Base Hits Beat Home Runs

Chasing the one big trade is what ruined me early on. Consistency is what built my account. A steady $200-300 a day compounds into far more than swinging for $5K and blowing up when you’re wrong. The small, repeatable wins are what keep you in the game long enough to scale. I started with making $20-40 a day or a trade I should say, and slowly sizing up, then gaining more capital and copy tading these smaller trades accross plenty accounts.



Bottom Line

Trading isn’t about finding a secret strategy. It’s about building a clear playbook, respecting risk, journaling your execution, and protecting your mindset. Once you do those things consistently, confidence stops being a feeling and becomes a fact backed by your data.



I’d like to continue doing write-ups like this if it helps the community. For my next post, I can go deeper into:



A) My exact journaling and review workflow (what I log, how I review, and how it’s helped me improve)

B) An autopsy of my first year, the 10 biggest mistakes I made and how I fixed each one

1. **Don't trade when you're angry, emotional, tired, or distracted.** Seriously, this is a recipe for disaster. Your best decisions come from a clear head.
2. **Don't risk more than 2% of your account per trade.** Protect your capital above all else. A string of small losses is recoverable; a few big ones can be devastating.
3. **Always have your stop-loss decided (and ideally set) before you enter a trade.** Know your exit before you even think about your entry. No exceptions.
4. **Walk away when the market is choppy or unclear.** You don't have to trade every day. Sometimes, the best trade is no trade at all. Patience pays.
5. **Test your strategy in fantasy trading (or demo) first, and thoroughly.** Don't commit real capital until you have some statistical edge and confidence.
6. **Trading is 80% waiting, 20% execution. Get good at both.** The patience to wait for your setup is just as crucial as the discipline to pull the trigger correctly.
7. **Do NOT revenge trade.** Ever. Chasing losses only leads to bigger losses. Step away, cool off, and come back another day.
8. **Track your win rate, risk-reward, & holding time diligently.** If you're not tracking, you're guessing. Data helps you refine and improve.",188,38,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1mf5dw1/my_top_8_trading_rules/,year,Advice,0.98
1m6g543,2025-07-22,2025-07-22 10:50:49,How to start day trading for beginners ( Real Truth ),"Hello everyone. I have been trading for the past 8.5 years now and I've been profitable since the past 1.5 yrs now. 

been seeing alot of beginner posts here so let’s talk about something real for a second.


I'm going to share one of my personal live story with you guys as a lesson. 

I started playing chess 2 yrs ago and i got stuck at 900 elo ( yes it's laughable but it's the best i coudl do ) for many many months almost a year. Until i realized there's no freaking point in playing countless games i need to learn and gain more knowledge. Yes i did try YouTube but it wasn't working much for me. I would do well and then fall back down. So i found a guy who lived near me and played chess, i decided to ask him what his rating was, he was a 1400 rated chess player. I asked him to teach me how he plays chess. He wasn't a great teacher but watching him play and just playing together with him helped me and i broke the 1000 rating barrier and reached 1380 ( my maximum yet) in just a few months. In less than half the amount of time that i spent playing by myself being stuck at 900 only. 

In every part of life, we learn from others.

You learn how to walk, talk, and eat from your parents.
You learn math and writing from your teachers.
You learn your first job from senior coworkers or mentors.

So why do people treat trading like it’s any different?

This is the only field where people think they can jump in, risk real money, and somehow figure it out alone… for free… with no guidance…like it's a walk in the park. Brother this is psychological warfare. 

And then they wonder why they lose.

Let me be very clear.
The no.1 reason 99% of people fail in trading is because they try to do it without a mentor. Yes i know there are many scammers out there but I'm being dead serious. It's your job to find out who's legit or not. 

Don't go to a YouTube guru Especially TJR. He's a clown who's trades like an intermediate level trader at best. 

I’m talking about someone real.
Someone who can sit with you, walk you through real trades, call you out on your mistakes, and actually teach.

I didn’t have that. I had to figure it all out on my own and i paid for it in time. 
It took me 8 years painful years. Had i found a mentor for myself i would have been profitable in under a year max. I did look around but i couldn't pay $2k - 3$k for mentorships. So i kept grinding countless hours of my life watching the screen. Had i found someone for under $300 i would have taken it in a heartbeat. Money is not the most important thing. Time is. 

If you want to do it solo? Be my guest.
But don’t expect to get it in a few months. You never will.
And don’t assume just because you’ve been trading for years that you're getting better.
I know people who’ve been trading for 10 to 15 years and still can’t make money.
Time alone means nothing in this game.

My biggest mistake was letting ego lead the way.
I thought I was smart enough to crack the code without help. I have done some deep introspection of myself over the years thanks to trading. I have realized i needed to lose my ego completely and learn from anyone who was better than me st getting results in anything that I'm interested in. Be it chess or anything else.

The market humbled me again and again until i lost my ego completely.


This is how real life works. Yes i know you all want to be independent and financially free from everything but the process of getting there requires you to be dependent on others. Atleast im the beginning if you want to save years of your life. 


drop the ego and learn from someone who’s already profitable.

There are a few traders out there who actually teach what works if you look hard enough.

I wish you all the best.

1jy2840,2025-04-13,2025-04-13 03:29:46,Bull Trap incoming ≈ 5700.00 (ES!),"I can't make it any simpler than that so listen carefully: the market is in a territory of extremely high uncertainty of the sort that will quickly vaporize short-term gains. While a bearish bias is certainly warranted in the medium and long term, volatility is out of control and movements in either direction are going to be extreme regardless of overall direction. This is not your typical market that's moving off of the usual shenanigans (stop-hunts, shakeouts; wide ranges), this is a market where even the largest players are in a ""sink or swim"" mentality on a mission to not get torched by one another.

What we are about to witness is bloodshed between the largest players as they cut at each other's neck to close previous positions at optimal pricing and set themselves up for the next leg of the trip. Your job early in the week is to be patient and not get gutted. If you're loaded on calls/bullish, take profit on half your lot, trail the rest, and exit where you may... Unfortunately, puts/bears seem like they're going to get cooked early.

We've all been following what's been going on so I'm going to spare myself from providing further context and turning this into an essay it doesn't need to be. Analysis/outlook past this point is a culmination of retail sentiment, current political/economic developments, economic outlook, and TA (ES; S&P 500 Futures):

[ES!; S&P 500 FUTURES \(10m\)](https://preview.redd.it/mus5gc1rjjue1.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=87b7940d92e2f73e886344b6ecab70d8da1d34cc)

The mid-day squeeze is what sets the stage as the ""unsettled auction"" between 5086.50 & 5277.25 on 04/09 was settled the following day when pricing revisited and rebounded from this area; marking the end of the early session sell-off to KSL 5149.50. 



On Friday (04/11), we see pricing reject a revisitation to this area in the early session as pricing stayed tight and big money kept things in check/consolidated; providing confirmation of the key resistance-level (KRL) @ 5280.50 set on Monday (04/07) as new-found support; which was previously confirmed as a key price-level on Tuesday as prices rejected from this level for a second time out of the open. 

  
What does all of that mean? It means that the previous area of price instability (the previous unsettled auction) was explored and settled back to the upside; indicating no further transactions were sought in this region by larger players. For all intents and purposes, continuation to the downside now rests on pricing plunging through the key levels at KRL 5280.50 (and subsequently KSL 5149.50). Should a convincing breach of 5280.50 be made, KSL 5149.50 gets burned and we dive (which I don't find very likely given news and without discovering new price to the upside).

  
So we look above:

https://preview.redd.it/n7vk3a96qjue1.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=62cdb25fdc44b7077d8048f896dd9b98b6c4e04e

Here lies a very nasty trap: as pricing seeks to test KRL 5528.50 it will be inevitably ran through on recent news. The no-man's land that is 5528.50 thru 5771.75 is going to get bulls torched once the top sets in for what will be a violent drop headed straight back toward KRL 5280.50. Both KRL 5528.50 and KRL 5771.75 beg for a retest, and both coincide with the pricing discrepancies formed by the gap between 04/02's close and 04/03's open. 

  
Once in lala land, long positions opened on 04/09, 04/10, and 04/11 will be taking profits and consolidating short. Anyone who shorted back in JAN will also be profit taking, waiting on news, then loading short again. Any calls placed toward the top of this region are SMOKED and the squeeze down will be as glorious as the one we witnessed in Wednesday's afternoon session. When pricing arrives here, DO NOT BUY THE NEWS. 5650.00 should be target to TP for anyone on the right side of this move. 



# To Recap:

KRL 5280.50 is a key support level with two significant confirmations. If it is breached at all, KSL 5149.50 should be tested with a rapid retracement before a continuation to the downside. This is unlikely to happen before testing key levels to the upside for various reasons. Therefore, sights should also be set at KRL 5528.50; which, given price action, is not a very convincing resistance level. Should KRL 5528.50 be tested, it is likely blown through and quickly retraced on a retest as support before rapid continuation; as pricing lacks discovery between KRL 5528.50 and KRL 5771.75. 



Given that large players will be in a dance of taking profits on short positions from the ATH, closing red on shorts made 04/09-04/11, and then taking profits on long positions established 04/09-04/11— and given that retail investors will be FOMO'ing in on any bullish news— pricing likely arrives to ≈ 5700.00 in short order before becoming choppy and ultimately failing to retest 5771.75 in a tight consolidation and swift move back to the downside; as such a level (5771.75) is so obvious for retest that everyone in this community (and the degens on Wall St.) will be itching to go long and pull the trigger on calls as soon as we hit 5700.00.

1iozk5p,2025-02-13,2025-02-13 20:48:24,Finding an edge is crazy hard,"I am trying to become a profitable trader for about 4 years now. I've had my moments of success and I am on a very good path in my opinion but I want to adress something that has been misrepresented in this industry in my humble opinion. There are a ton of people here who claim that ""every strategy works, it's the trader who makes a strategy proftiable"" or ""strategy is about 10-20% of the game, the rest is psychology"". And from my experience it's just wrong. Yeah trading psychology is hard and I believe a lot of people have to reprogramme their minds to become profitable and that is a rough journey. But finding an edge, a profitable strategy is at least as hard as psychology. I've looked into, backtested and worked with various strategies from ICT, Supply and Demand, breakout systems, trend following systems, time based systems and a lot more and what I've found is that nearly nothing works. The 2 strategies I've build that work for me right now I had to build myself and it took a lot of work, experience and knowledge to build these.  I see so many people saying that their problem is psychology, so that means that they already solved the puzzle of finding or building a profitable strategy and from my experience I simply don't believe them. You all understand that banks and hedge funds hire high class mathematicians, physicists and economists to build their strategies and you from the basement of your parents built a working strategy after 1-2 years studying Youtube-BS. I had to do crazy brain gymnastics to find the 2 edges I have right now. I sacrificed 3 and 4 years in front of the charts to build my 2 strategies and one of them only works with high probabilites under certain conditions. And both of these edges I found myself backtesting concepts and ideas, not from youtube or a course. Here is my claim: Most failing traders don't fail because of psychology but because they don't have a real edge. Most people copy strategies from courses and from Youtube/social media and I belive over 99% of these strategies don't work, at least from my experience ( and I paid a ton of money for courses). And if they somewhat work you still have to gain experience with them and adjust them to your experiences and your personality. Trading psychology is a great topic for scammers because they can ramble for hours without saying much and nobody is able to prove that they are just rambling. My journey of me finding an edge teached me how hard it is to find a real and also sustainable edge and I think the trading education industry is painting a wrong picture of trading that is crazy harmful for beginners. And I believe a lot of people out there who believe that they have a problem with psychology actually have a problem with their strategy because it is bad and it doesn't guide them to good setups through precise and clear rules. If you don't know what you are doing you become emotional. What was a big switch in my trading career was learning how it feels to trade a strategy that you have a 100% trust in because you know there is an edge behind it and you've gained the experience with it that gives you the confidence you need. A good strategy and experience with it leads to good psychology. Before you build your psychology you have to nail the strategy part. And that one is much harder that the industry is trying to portray it. 

Can anybody relate to this? Or do you think I am wrong? I am open for a discussion because this is something I am thinking about for years now. And if you find spelling mistakes, englisch is not my mother tongue.

Here’s how to fix it:

**Use a Higher Timeframe (HTF) for bias.**  
That’s where you read market structure, sentiment, liquidity zones, and major levels.

**Use a Lower Timeframe (LTF) for execution.**  
That’s where you time your entry, manage risk, and look for precision.

The two must be aligned.  
Bias without precision leads to missed trades.  
Precision without bias leads to random trades.

Here’s a framework that works:

* Monthly → 1H entries
* Weekly → 15M entries
* Daily → 5M entries
* 4H → 1M entries

Stop flipping between timeframes with no purpose. Know your context and trigger.  
Align them both, and your edge sharpens fast. Journal and track everything to get to know yourself and to understand what style of trading fits you best.

I have also traded for a few years on my own while working and studying and I can safely say that trading is hard. The majority of our clients lose all their money and cannot trade even if their life dependent on it.

I have reached to the conclusion that even if a retail successful does exist, they are simply an outlier. Combination of leverage and spreads is dooming. The only way to beat the market from what I have seen is that you need to find a true edge. 

The edge needs to go beyond charts and single instruments. It can either be a combination of instruments or brokers.

On the other hand, I would advise that you stop trading and invest. The difference is that the second one is not looking for a quick buck but simply trusting the process that markets will go up as a whole in the future. You do not have to cherry pick stocks or any other instruments. Simply invest in cheap ETFs.

I've been trading for about 5 years and am ""more-or less"" profitable. Basically, 2024 ended in the very light green. (S&p 500 would have been way better return) and 2025 is starting off well.

What i discovered, for me, is the biggest thing, is the psychology.

I dont have a real ""edge"". i trade stupid simple. I avoid big news, i avoid 2H before NY closing, and 30 minutes before and after open. I avoid fridays (dont know why yet, but cant make money on fridays) ...Other then that, i simply scalp session trend following bounces. 

My biggest 2 ""OMG"" moments... 1: The more i keep it simple, the better i perform and 2: I am my worst enemy.. and heres the advice

I trade FOREX and i recently discovered that my biggest ennemy is myself.. FOMO and revenge trading so i added a new rule and its been helping me.

Basically, i follow 3 pairs but only trade 1 actively. if my trade wins ""normal range"", i stay in that pair. If my trade wins BIG or loosses, i switch pairs. And heres the WHY. This forces me to ""blank slate"". i cannot revenge trade because i have to re-analyse breaking my possibilities to FOMO or revenge.

I conduct zoom workshops for beginner and intermediate traders who are looking to learn technical analysis. Have conducted over a dozen of them in this sub and it helps almost everyone who joins it. 

I teach pure price action, key levels and have developed strategies to trade the markets based on that. Once you understand price action and how key levels work alongside price action - it’s easy to develop profitable strategies but it requires a lot of practice to trade them and spot them in live markets. 

Anyone who’s going through a rough phase, confused phase or losing streaks or even break even phases can join and maybe learn a thing or two. All questions are welcome in the zoom session. 

I do this group session for free. I don’t charge for this. It’s solely to explain markets to traders and looking to benefit from an experienced analyst and trader. I’ve got over 6 years of experience to share and I’m a full time profitable trader. Keep in mind - that joining my session isn’t going to make you profitable immediately- I’m only going to show you the market for what it is so you can get a very good understanding of it. That is all. Once you’ve learned the factors involved in the market - it’s repetitive, deliberate practice that is going to make you first a really good analyst and then a good consistently profitable trader. Of course there’s also psychology involved as I know that trading is 100% psychology and technical analysis is the start.

1nqij5e,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 17:01:37,"What Losing $72,000 Taught Me About Trading","

I don’t post this to flex or to get sympathy. I’m posting this because every trader at some point hits a wall, and for me that wall cost $72,117. Looking back at those trades, I learned more from that drawdown than from any winning streak I’ve ever had. If you’re in this game, I hope what I share here saves you time, money, and a few blown accounts.

1. Risk management isn’t a suggestion
When I dug into those losses, the biggest mistake wasn’t the setups themselves. It was that I had no consistent risk plan. Sometimes I’d risk $200, sometimes $2,000, depending on how “confident” I felt. Confidence is not risk management. Without a fixed risk per trade, every loss compounds unpredictably. The number that stood out most to me wasn’t the -$72K. It was the 13 consecutive losses. With proper risk sizing, that stretch should have been frustrating, not account-ending.

2. Losing streaks reveal the truth about your process.
It’s easy to feel like a genius when trades are going your way. You start to believe the market “makes sense” and you’ve got it figured out. A real losing streak exposes whether you have an actual system or if you’re just winging it. During those 13 red trades in a row, I realized I didn’t have a defined playbook. I had “ideas” and “feelings”  but nothing I could consistently execute. If you can’t clearly write down your setup, your entry/exit criteria, and your risk rules, you don’t have a strategy. You have hope.

3. The psychological spiral is real.
After a string of red trades, my instinct was to “make it back.” That’s when I started oversizing, taking lower-quality setups, and ignoring my stops. Every losing trader knows this spiral, but very few actually put systems in place to stop it. What I should have done was step away after 3 losses, reset, and review. Instead, I traded through it and bled out. Discipline isn’t about avoiding emotions, it’s about building rules that protect you from yourself when those emotions hit.

4. Journaling turns pain into progress.
The $72K wasn’t wasted because I documented every single one of those trades. I tracked context, entries, exits, and what was going through my head. Patterns became obvious: I was most reckless after 10:30 AM, I entered early instead of waiting for confirmation, and I risked more after a loss. Without journaling, I would’ve walked away with nothing but regret. With it, I built the foundation of my current process.

Losing money doesn’t make you a bad trader. Refusing to learn from it does. If you’re new, don’t wait until you’re $72,000 down to respect risk, build a playbook, and journal your execution. If you’ve already taken big losses, don’t waste them  extract every lesson you can and let the data, not your emotions, shape your next chapter.",177,46,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nqij5e/what_losing_72000_taught_me_about_trading/,year,Due-diligence,0.94
1je2kud,2025-03-18,2025-03-18 07:17:47,Will Bitcoin Burn Everyone This Time?,"MicroStrategy has accumulated nearly 500,000 BTC, but they are now slowing down their purchases. If they start liquidating strategically, they could crash Bitcoin without anyone noticing until it's too late.

Imagine the perfect play:

They sell slowly OTC to avoid scaring the market.

Meanwhile, they short BTC with leverage to maximize profits.

Once support breaks, they dump everything, triggering liquidations.

Bitcoin crashes below 30k, ETFs see massive outflows, and they cash in billions.


If BTC no longer grows exponentially, MicroStrategy is trapped. They either exit now with a profit or risk imploding with the asset. And if they decide to sell, we could witness the biggest Big Short in crypto history.

Too paranoid or a plausible scenario?

1gwemg8,2024-11-21,2024-11-21 07:01:16,I’m too dumb to be a trader ,"Not looking for any sympathy rather looking to rant here after coming to realisation that after 3 years of trading I am deciding to give up. 

I am generally just not smart/ emotionally smart enough to be a trader lol. I would say that to become a profitable trader, you need to be pretty clever as you are competing against the top qualified people everyday who will literally destroy you if you lack the emotional intelligence. 

I came to this realisation as I just kept repeating the same mistakes and never learned from them. An example would be that I would be in a perfectly good trade and then talk myself out of it almost every time, to then watch it work, chase it and lose money lol. Other things include using ridiculous stop losses that make no sense, being greedy and just making bizarre emotionally driven trades. In summary, I just would be in constant fear and overthink/ overanalyse everything to death instead of just doing it.

I wouldn’t even say I’m bad at reading the charts , my gut is actually correct more than 50% of the time so in theory I should be profitable but the emotional aspect I just couldn’t get over, it’s like when I went into the markets every day my brain would be in self sabotage mode.

Because of this I went through levels of severe depression, anxiety and it’s pretty much destroyed my relationships and health both mentally and physically which is really why I needed to quit - the dark side too it.

It hurts to quit but I think I needed a reality check after not making any money after three years. I think like most people I was drawn in by the fact you could make a good living working as an entrepreneur, but honestly and it hurts to admit it, I’m just not built to be an independent person, I need a boss or someone telling me what to do as I am pretty much incapable of making my own decisions and taking risks - a more structured lifestyle, maybe because I have been too conditioned through school etc.

I will quit trading and instead move to investing where you need to think about it much less rather than trying to guess the move every day as I’m just not built for the day trading lifestyle.

Also I already know I’m going to get some comments about ‘you are what you think’ etc but I genuinely think some people like myself need a reality check as it’s more of a personality thing",176,261,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1gwemg8/im_too_dumb_to_be_a_trader/,year,Discussion,0.98

1n4f7b9,2025-08-30,2025-08-30 19:03:07,My $86K Trading Journey,"Last year, I was a complete rookie trader and I was totally confused about how to get started. I began by watching free lessons on YouTube and listening to all of these experienced traders. They opened my eyes in a big way, but then I realized that I needed something more structured if I was going to take my trading to the next level.

At first, I was looking for those fancy trading courses on the internet but they were far beyond what I could afford :/. That was not a problem though, because I kept at it and picked up whatever I could from trading forums about market psychology, risk management, and technical configurations. After months of independent learning, I eventually decided to spend some money on courses in order to get serious about trading

I committed myself fully and promised that I would learn and practice every day. I focused on methods such as trend following, momentum trading, and smart position sizing. Within approximately three months, I began to see real gains. My confidence increased as my trades became more frequent and profitable.

Now, I am happy to say that I have made $86k through trading by using good education, effective risk management, and a great deal of patience. Trading is not simple or guaranteed guys, but if u r motivated enough and well prepared, it can definitely pay u back trust me!!

I do not usually spend much time on Reddit, but I just found this community and felt like sharing my journey.

Just crypto and long term dividend paying stocks. Recently, I've been going through a lot and working 60 hour weeks has left me with some extra cash so I've been getting into it pretty hard-core. Options especially. I love everything about watching the charts, analyzing and strategizing on how it might move, and then the excitement of watching it all unfold. I've found that in my quest of wanting to live a comfortable life where my money works for me, that also means losing people that have the 9-5 retire at 65 mindset. I'm hungry to surround myself with people that also have a bigger goal in mind instead of people that scoff at the idea of trading and potentially making 6 figures one day. I know a lot of people had to figure this out on their own and I was lucky enough to have a dad to talk basic stocks with, but never having any substantial conversations with people that seriously trade or even have an interest in it has been really bringing me down.

1m5suwd,2025-07-21,2025-07-21 15:44:08,Overtrading is the silent killer of your account.,"Nobody talks about how hard it is to just do nothing.

You think you’re working hard by taking 15 trades a day.  
You think you’re “grinding” by forcing setups that aren’t there.  
You think that more trades = more money.

But all you’re doing is bleeding out slowly.

Overtrading is usually you trying to force the market to pay you when it doesn’t owe you shit, when you're trying to avoid discomfort after a loss and just to feel “productive” because sitting on your hands feels like laziness.

I’ve watched profitable weeks turn into red weeks because I couldn’t sit still.  
I’ve watched a winning trade turn into a losing day because I “just wanted one more.”  
I’ve watched my mindset get destroyed because I was chasing dopamine, not discipline.

Trading isn’t about activity. It’s about **selectivity***.*

You don’t get paid for pressing buttons.  
You get paid for **waiting for the right moment***,* then executing without hesitation.

If you’re stuck in the cycle of overtrading, try this:

* Give yourself a **max trades per day rule** (I use 3). 
* Force yourself to walk away after a full loss. 
* Pre-plan your A+ setups and ignore everything else.

1jv2vr8,2025-04-09,2025-04-09 06:54:11,8 years Later . What i have learnt !,"After 8 years in the markets, I want to share some hard-earned wisdom with those of you walking this path. The journey of a trader is unlike any other.

Trust your system, but question your emotions. The most profitable trades often feel uncomfortable, while the most comfortable ones can lead to disaster. I've learned this countless times, watching positions I loved turn against me while the ones that made me nervous delivered returns.

Consistency trumps perfection. The traders who survive aren't those who never lose—they're the ones who show up every day with discipline, following their rules even when it hurts. Your daily habits matter more than your biggest wins.

Protect your capital fiercely. No setup, no matter how compelling, deserves to risk your trading future. The ability to say ""I don't know"" and step aside is as valuable as any technical skill you'll develop.

Keep a trading journal. Your greatest teacher is your own experience, but only if you study it honestly. Review your decisions without judgment but with unwavering honesty.
The market doesn't care about your feelings, your bills, or your dreams. This isn't cruelty—it's neutrality. Once you stop expecting the market to validate you, you'll find freedom in trading what is, not what you wish would be.

Isolation kills traders. Find a community that challenges you, supports you, and speaks truth when you need to hear it. The market will humble all of us eventually—having people who understand that journey is invaluable.

Finally, remember that trading is a marathon. Eight years in, I'm still learning every day. The moment you think you've mastered the markets is precisely when they'll teach you otherwise.
Stay humble. Stay hungry. And most importantly, stay in the game.",161,53,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1jv2vr8/8_years_later_what_i_have_learnt/,year,Due-diligence,0.95
1m71s26,2025-07-23,2025-07-23 02:20:44,What I learned from teaching other traders,"Most of you got one thing right and one thing wrong. One works so well for you and the other doesn’t work at all and you haven’t exactly processed it right. 

I’ve taught about 80-100 traders so far I think (ballpark) one thing I’ve noticed is - all of you are hard workers, smart and quick thinking people. When I teach technical analysis I don’t find anyone messing it up - grasping the idea or concepts behind it or practicing it well and learning and honestly just working hard but in trading that’s not enough. In other areas of life, any other job, it’s enough and it’s exactly what you expect to do before making it work for you. But in trading the thing where most of you mess it up is the reason why you wanna trade. To make money. 

How you wanna make money always comes in between your skill of analysing the markets. I had the same issue too, the first 2-4 years of trading and you know when you’re so skilled in technicals that you realise at some point that you have to change something if you want your skill to even work? I worked and processed about how and why I feel the way I do about money and here are some hard truths I’ve learned: 

1. Money comes last in trades. 

You don’t come into the market to make money, you come into the market to sense what’s happening first. Analyse it well enough to see where you can find good trades and then only when you “know” that yes this is a solid trade then you “attach” money to it. 

2. Greed and fear takes control over you 

When you’re in a trade, the greed about money inside you, starts working. The fear in you starts working. The FOMO kicks in. The wanting more out of what this trade can actually give you starts working. 

3. Your emotional attachment to money reveals itself in the market.

It’s not visible when you’re studying charts or backtesting or learning from someone. But the second real money is on the line - your beliefs, fears, fantasies, and past experiences with money show up in full force. This is when trading stops being technical and becomes psychological. You’ll notice you start breaking your own rules, doubting your analysis, entering too early or too late, or refusing to exit. It’s not because you’re not skilled - it’s because your emotions have hijacked the process.

4. The inability to accept losses or be ok with it completely 

This is the most common and the hardest one for everyone I’ve taught, including me at a point. It’s so hard. Why? Loss is seen and felt as the worst thing in the world when it comes to money right? Who would want to make a loss? Why would I trade to make a loss and not profit? Cuz after all profits is why I’m even working hard. Wrong! Sure, it can work in other areas of business - the whole point is to just focus on profits and do anything and everything to minimise losses and avoid it at all costs. But in trading - what’s the easiest thing? Making a loss. Now, in anything that you as a person have done in life where you did it well - how? Cuz you enjoyed doing it. It’s only when we truly enjoy something we can even do it better and better - likewise in trading, the easiest thing is making a loss, not profit, obviously. So, if you don’t enjoy making a loss, you can never truly enjoy trading and if you don’t enjoy trading as a whole, you never really master it, and if you don’t master it? 

The only suggestion and the most important one to all aspiring traders is that process your relationship with money while you’re learning technicals. Don’t make the same mistake I did when I went full speed on learning technicals alone and letting technicals speak for my poor psych with money. Biggest mistake - learned later painfully but when I did process, my entire worldview changed. 

As you learn some factor in technicals and trade it - journal your emotion and thoughts and write up about it and ask yourself why you do that. Simultaneously. 

The difference between a profitable trader and a hardworking trader is this. If you don’t process your relationship with money and make it work for you, you’ll always be a hardworking trader and never fully attain your potential.

I also reduced screen time—less trades, better trades. Journaling my emotions helped me see my biggest enemy wasn’t the market, it was me.

1llv2xp,2025-06-27,2025-06-27 10:19:19,The real truth about trading and trading educators,"Right so 45 yrs old here and been trading futures professionally since 2004 day in n out. I have gone local about a year now and when I am bored I read some forums mainly about trading especially here on Reddit. i have never posted anything over the internet cause sometimes you get into arguments and arguing over the internet its like arguing with a wall.

The only thing that I can agree with reading forums is that trading is extremely difficult. Especially on a CONSISTENT basis. Thats the key nothing else. If you are not consistent in this industry u will have a short journey.

Lets get something straight here. Real traders are secretive creatures and slightly weird by nature. Even if you are not you will most definitely become one. That being said there is not a single chance in this world they will reveal their strategy to anyone let alone go ahead and publish it. It is just common sense. And lets say that a ""Robin Hood"" goes bananas and decides to share their strat online and its a successful one. It will be short lived cause it will quickly get traction and the more people join the more difficult it will be to join that offer or bid. You will be seeing iceberg orders with people trying to do the same thing. And thats not even the worse part. If it is successful and people are able to join the strat (assuming that its public and the stop losses are on display) market makers will always chase the stop losses cause its effectively free money. I keep on saying to myself over the years that trading is constant search of stops anyways. So thats that.

Now the reason you see so many youtubers or educators revealing their strat is because it is not successful in the long run or its just stupid and its not worth the attention of the market makers. They make money either from views or by selling courses

""Those who cannot do teach"". Right let me tell you smth about that. I had some years especially between 2016-2020 where I just couldnt make it. Or I was just making peanuts. Had some colleagues that went the education route and started making tons of money, some even more than they were when they were trading. They were legit just retired from day trading for whatever reason. The only problem was that they were as well saying what people wanted to hear cause you know, money. If they were profitable they would still go on and trade, but we cannot exclude the fact that there are shit ton of money in that field with great demand and most people have mouths to feed. Nothing wrong with that as long as you are honest to your audience smth in terms like ""listen I used to be good I can tell you the right stuff but the journey is tough and u gotta own it"". Dont see many people doing that.

Right so that was the positive part and this is my subjective opinion about trading in general. No strategy works forever and the last 10 years some strats could be working for a few months and then you have to adjust it to the current market environment. Thats tough and that is why 95% of pro trading is done by algos. They have embedded systems that change strats before you can even blink your eyes. That is the challenge and the most interesting path to consistency. You keep on grinding and changing trying to keep up. Easier in the past more tough now but it is what it is. If you dont have a strategy that is adaptable you are toast period. And I will repeat trading is the mental effort to remain CONSISTENT. Big updays come through consistency, confidence and proper risk management the rest are just lucky punches. Baby steps as my first mentor used to say.

I have met thousands and worked with a lot of traders side by side especially before algos. If I had to give a brutal number out of 1000 people that are really interested in pursuing trading only 1 will be consistent in the long run. And I am not by any means saying that I was always consistent. I was not. But I never gave up and here we are.

1l13h5y,2025-06-01,2025-06-01 19:43:56,The Daily Habit That Separates Pros from Gamblers (From a 7-Figure Trader),"**This is what I learned from my mentor who is a 7-figure options/stock trader:**

He doesn’t just show up and trade. He prepares with intention, and logs every detail like a pro. He is an order flow trader with 8+ years of experience in the game and this is what I learned with my talk with him when he was mentoring me.



Every morning he starts with a full breakdown:





* **Key economic events**
* **Context for the open**
* **Previous day summary**
* **Pre-market behavior and price action**
* **Bullish and bearish scenarios based on levels**



Then comes the part that stuck with me the most:

**He writes a daily reminder to himself.**

Stuff like:

“Stick to your thesis. Focus on high RR locations. Don’t FOMO. Let the trades come to you.”

Those simple lines keep his mindset locked in all day. He also highlights 1–3 important stocks, outlines the trend, and sets key leves, inflection points, support, resistance, before the bell rings.



If you’ve been winging your trades or feeling lost mid-day… Try journaling like this.

Let me know if you want the template he gave me so you can copy and paste it in your own journaling tool:

1hcmwek,2024-12-12,2024-12-12 09:59:23,Is Trading Really This “Simple”?,"When writing this, I intentionally avoided using the word “easy.” Trading is far from easy. Instead, I chose “simple” because, at its core, trading is just that—simple. You follow a set of rules, and if you adhere to them correctly, you’re rewarded more often than not. The simplicity lies in the structure of the rules, but the challenge is in mastering the psychology and discipline required to follow them. That’s what makes these “simple” rules anything but easy.

I’m a beginner, having been trading for just over six months. Most of what I’ve learned comes from ChatGPT and YouTube. I’ve never paid for a mentor. Instead, I used ChatGPT as my virtual mentor, asking personalized questions about trading and getting insightful responses.

I started with a demo account, practicing with €2,000—an amount I felt comfortable committing once I moved to live trading. My goal was €100 a day, enough to live comfortably.

I began my journey with SMC and ICT principles. The first strategy I tried was ICT’s Silver Bullet strategy. I spent countless hours watching every candle form on the 1-minute chart. For months, it felt like the strategy wasn’t working for me. Trades would often reach 2R or 3R, but I wouldn’t take profit because doing so went against the strategy and my stop loss would be hit. Eventually, I abandoned Silver Bullet. However, it wasn’t a waste of time. Through me being glued to my trades, I learned to observe the market deeply and understand how price moves.

After giving up on Silver Bullet, I went back to basics. I noticed how the market reacts to liquidity. I learned about internal and external liquidity, which fundamentally boils down to two principles: the market chases external liquidity, and once that liquidity is taken, it moves to fill internal imbalances. This realization was a game-changer. I now understood that fair value gaps (internal liquidity) and resting liquidity (external liquidity) were key to trading.

While researching fair value gaps, I stumbled upon inverse fair value gaps. Combining my knowledge, I developed a strategy built on three core principles: daily bias, inverse fair value gaps, and resting liquidity.

When I started using this strategy, I saw immediate success. Trade after trade was profitable. But then, I ran into a problem: I was overtrading. The high frequency of trades led to losses, despite my overall profitability. To reach my goal of €100 daily with a €2,000 account, I needed to make several trades. While my win rate was high, the small risk-to-reward ratio required frequent trades, which (while seeing success) wasn’t sustainable.

My solution came through funded accounts. With more capital, I could trade less and still hit my goals. For example, with a €10,000 funded account, I only needed one successful trade per day to achieve a 2% account growth—€200, which exceeded my daily target. This shift resolved all my issues: fewer trades, less overtrading, and reduced risk.

Now, over 6 months later, I feel confident. I have a solid strategy, a realistic daily goal, and a profitable system with manageable risks. But a lingering question remains: Am I missing something? Many traders emphasize the difficulty of trading, and as a beginner I wonder if I’m being lulled into a false sense of security. I’m scared to take this next step. Is trading really this “simple”?

Edit: I’ve noticed some people are focusing on the percentages I mentioned, so I’d like to clarify. When I was paper trading, I set a daily goal of €100, regardless of the account size. Looking back, I now realize that aiming for €100 daily on a €2,000 account was completely unrealistic. achieving 25% account growth in a week isn’t sustainable. At the time, I was ignorant and didn’t fully understand this.

The point I’m making is that reaching a €100 daily goal becomes far more achievable with a €10,000 account. For further clarification, I don’t grow my account by 2% every day. On average, each successful trade earns me around €200 (2% of the account). This means I only need 2–3 successful trades per week to consistently hit my daily goal.",150,146,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1hcmwek/is_trading_really_this_simple/,year,Discussion,0.93

But now that I’ve been doing it for a while, I’ve realized something:

**Most of trading is just… waiting.**  
Waiting for a setup. Waiting for the right time. Waiting for the market to stop doing nothing.

Then out of nowhere, you get like 5–10 minutes where everything moves fast, and you either follow your plan or you panic and mess it up.

Most new traders (including me at first) just chase dopamine. New indicators. New “strategies.” Jumping into trades just to feel something.

But the people who actually make it?

• Stick to a few solid rules  
• Don’t trade just to trade  
• Don’t let wins or losses mess with their head  
• Keep track of their trades and actually review them

It’s not flashy. It’s not always fun. But it works.

1l2bcr0,2025-06-03,2025-06-03 09:03:56,Truth about FUTURES Trading,"I’ve been trading futures for 4 years. Only in the last year have I become consistently profitable  and even then, consistency didn’t come from some magic setup. It came from discipline, risk control, and mastering my own mind.

Here’s what I’ve actually learned about futures after years of screen time, pain, trial, and refinement. No fluff. No hype.

1. It’s not a scam.

It’s a business. If you treat it like a slot machine, it’ll eat you alive. But if you approach it with structure, edge, and discipline, it works.

2. It’s not “fast money.”

It’s a slow mastery.

Futures reward structure, not speed. Forget the one big trade. Focus on 100 good ones.

Slow and Steady. I love the saying ""Live to trade another day""

3. You don’t need to predict. You need to react.

Most failed traders spend 90% of their effort trying to guess where the market will go. Successful traders prepare scenarios and respond with discipline.

4. Risk management isn’t optional.

If you don’t know your max daily loss, your stop-loss per trade, and your risk per setup, you’re gambling. Period.

5. **Prop firms are legit**… for the right trader.

Most people fail prop firms not because of the rules, but because they’re not ready. But for those with structure and discipline, it’s a great way to scale with limited capital. Just avoid the joke ones.

6. No strategy works without emotional control.

You could have the best model in the world, but tilt, greed, and FOMO will kill it every time. The edge is only real if it’s executed consistently.

7. Live trading is 100x different than demo.

Demo teaches mechanics. Live teaches you about yourself. You’re not a trader until you can handle pressure with real risk on the table.

8. Futures require focus.

Trading ES or NQ isn’t like clicking around on a forex broker app. Depth of market, order flow, news events, it’s a more technical game. You need intention.

9. 1–3R base hits > trying to catch the full move.

The people trying to get rich off one trade usually go broke chasing it. Good futures traders hit singles, manage risk, and stay in the game long enough for compounding to do the work.

10. The market humbles everyone.

Every time I got overconfident, it reminded me who’s in charge. But every time I stayed patient, selective, and disciplined, it rewarded me.

My current system is simple:

I trade failed breakdowns on ES with clear liquidity targets, confluence, and 1–3R expectations. I journal every trade inside Tradezella. I prep with a daily game plan. And most importantly, I don’t trade if the setup isn’t there.

If you’re struggling, just know that most people never make it because they want fast money, not sustainable progress. It’s not about being right. it’s about doing the right things every day until it pays off.

Don't give up. Refine your system. Log your data. Focus on the process.

1nm2lej,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 12:25:25,Here's a realistic breakdown of what it actually takes to become a consistent trader,"Ive noticed most people get into day trading because they see screenshots of $5k, $10k, $50k days and think it’s a quick path to freedom. I’ll be straight with you guys, that’s the marketing version of trading. Please don't buy into it. The reality is much less glamorous, and if you don’t know what it really takes, you’re going to burn out fast. After 5 years in this game, i wanted to do a little write up on my honest breakdown of what consistency actually looks like. This is Part 3 of my education series here, follow if you want more.

1. Time commitment is way more than you expect.

Trading isn’t just 9:30am to 4pm. Real consistency comes from hours outside market time: premarket prep, journaling, reviewing trades, building watchlists, studying setups, and putting in screen time. Early on, I easily spent 40 to 60 hours a week between live trading and studying. If you treat this like a hobby, you’ll get hobby-level results.

And it’s not just the hours, it’s the years. Consistency doesn’t come in 6 months, or even a year for most people. You’re rewiring how you think about money, risk, and decision-making under pressure. Expect it to take 2 or 3 years of real effort before you’re truly stable.

2. Risk management is non-negotiable.

I know everyone hears this, but most beginners still ignore it. Consistency doesn’t mean you never lose... it means your losses are small and controlled while your winners are slightly bigger. That balance, over hundreds of trades, is what keeps you profitable.

I don’t care if you’ve got the best setup in the world; if you’re risking half your account on one trade, you’re gambling. True consistency comes from risking small, living to fight another day, and never letting one trade or one day define you.

3. Discipline beats strategy.

Every new trader is obsessed with finding the “perfect” strategy. They’ll cycle through indicators, patterns, and systems, convinced the answer is out there somewhere. The truth? Most basic strategies work if you follow them with discipline. Most traders fail not because of their system, but because they don’t stick to it.

Consistency is boring. It’s showing up, following the same rules, and resisting the urge to deviate because of greed or fear. If you can’t execute a simple plan consistently, no “advanced” strategy will save you.

4. You need emotional resilience.

Day trading will mess with your head. You’re going to lose money. You’re going to question if you’re cut out for this. You’re going to watch your P/L swing in seconds and feel emotions you didn’t know you had. The people who survive aren’t the ones who avoid that... they’re the ones who learn to handle it.

Emotional resilience means not tying your identity to your results. It means accepting red days without revenge trading. It means staying calm when you’re up big and not blowing it all chasing more. Without that mental toughness, you’ll self-destruct.

5. You have to treat it like a business.

This isn’t a game. If you’re serious about consistency, you have to approach trading like running a business. That means budgeting your capital, keeping records, analyzing performance, and making adjustments based on data, not emotion. Your journal is your balance sheet. Your setups are your products. Your time and focus are your resources.

When you treat trading like a hobby, it costs you money. When you treat it like a business, it gives you structure and accountability. That shift in mindset is often the difference between gamblers and professionals.

**Bottom line**

Becoming a consistent trader isn’t flashy. It’s not about one big win, a secret indicator, or a magic system. It’s about boring, repetitive, disciplined work.. day after day, year after year. If you accept that reality, you’ll stop chasing shortcuts and actually give yourself a chance to make it.

1lrauc0,2025-07-04,2025-07-04 01:30:44,Thought Going Full-Time Would Fix Everything.,"I used to think going full-time would magically solve all my trading problems. That once I could sit at my desk all day, everything would click. But the reality was brutal. Full-time didn’t make me a better trader overnight, it just gave me more time to dig myself into deeper holes.

When I first started, I’d chase every candle that moved, convinced I was one trade away from success. I spent year one lost in noise, bouncing between YouTube strategies, stuffing my charts with indicators I didn’t even understand. It felt like everyone else had the secret, except me.

Year two gave me false hope. I learned smart money concepts, cleaned up my charts, and passed a couple prop firm challenges. But every time I got funded, I’d blow the account just as fast. Discipline wasn’t there. I kept blaming the market, the spreads, the news, anything but myself.

By year three, I quit my job thinking going full-time would force me to “make it.” But the truth was, the transition nearly broke me. The pressure was suffocating. I still relied on side gigs to pay bills because trading alone wasn’t consistent. I thought more screen time would mean faster success. Instead, it magnified every flaw in my process.

What changed wasn’t a new strategy. It was finally admitting the problem was me. I started journaling every entry, every exit, every emotion. Seeing exactly where I ignored stops, oversized, or chased gave me the clarity I needed. My edge wasn’t some secret indicator. It was the ability to execute my plan without self-sabotage. To this day I still have a stable side income and don't fully rely on trading and that really helped take the pressure off.

  
Learn to do new things, creative things and be useful.

Now, I trade with simple setups and focus on preserving capital, not forcing wins. I know it looks easy from the outside, but if you’re still grinding, don’t quit. The real turning point isn’t more hours on the charts. It’s learning to face yourself and fix what’s broken inside.

If you’re in the middle of this journey, I promise it can click. But it only does once you stop searching for shortcuts and start holding yourself accountable.

* He recently mentioned a “U.S. Crypto Reserve” with XRP, SOL, and ADA — those coins spiked.
* Another time, he posted *“THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!”* just hours before announcing a China tariff pause. Markets rallied hard.

Thing is, **these posts often hit before the market reacts**, but there’s no good way to catch them unless you’re doomscrolling Truth Social (which… isn’t ideal). It’s also not available outside the U.S., and most of his posts are just noise.

# So I’m building a simple alert app called Trumpet

It does 3 things:

1. Watches Trump’s Truth Social account
2. Uses AI to filter for *market-moving* posts only
3. Sends a fast push notification when one drops

I’m starting small — only Trump posts for now. Later, I want to add other signals like Fed announcements, political stock trades (Pelosi, etc.), or SEC news.

1noh5ve,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 09:18:13,The harsh truths nobody tells you about trading,"Most people come into day trading with dreams of financial freedom, working from a laptop, and making thousands before lunch time. And i honestly don’t blame them.. that’s how it’s sold online. But the reality of day trading is a lot harsher than what you see here from /r/wallstreetbets screenshots. For those who are serious about this, i wanted to list some of the truths most people won’t tell you until you’ve already lost a ton of money. This is part of an ongoing education series on reddit, if you like write ups like these, follow my account for more.

1. Most people lose money (and keep losing).

It’s estimated that 80 to 90% of traders fail, and that stat is no joke. The market is a zero-sum game; your wins come from someone else’s losses, and when you’re new, you’re the one feeding the experienced players. No strategy, guru, or indicator will change the fact that you’re paying tuition to the market in the beginning.

The hard part isn’t just learning setups..  it’s surviving long enough to actually get good. And the majority never make it past that stage because they run out of money or burn out mentally before they develop any consistency.

2. It takes years, not months, to get consistent.

A lot of beginners think they’ll be profitable within 6 months if they just grind hard enough. The truth is it usually takes 2 to 3 years of daily effort before you can really call yourself consistent. That’s thousands of hours of screen time, journaling, reviewing trades, and slowly building emotional resilience.

If that sounds like too much, trading probably isn’t for you. This is more like learning a professional craft (surgery, law, engineering) than picking up a side hustle. If you treat it like a shortcut, you’ll blow up.

3. Trading is boring when done right.

The highlight reels on social media show explosive wins and big green days. What you don’t see is that consistent trading is painfully repetitive. You’re taking the same setups over and over, cutting losers quickly, and stacking small wins.

If you’re looking for excitement, you’ll force trades, gamble on hype stocks, and churn your account into dust. The truth is the boring traders are the ones still around after 5 years.

4. Your emotions are your biggest enemy.

Everyone thinks they’ll be calm and logical until they watch their P/L swing hundreds or thousands in seconds. Fear makes you sell winners too early, greed makes you hold losers too long, and ego makes you size up when you shouldn’t.

No book or strategy will fix this for you; you only learn by facing it. The sooner you realize trading is 80% psychology and 20% strategy, the sooner you’ll start working on the real skill set that matters.

5. You won’t get rich with a small account.

Turning $1k into $100k in a year makes for a great screenshot, but it’s not reality. A small account limits your options and magnifies your risk. Realistic growth is slow, and it compounds over time. If you’re starting with $1 to 2k, your first goal should be survival and skill-building, not quitting your job.

The harsh truth is trading for income requires a big enough account to absorb losses and still generate meaningful returns. You don’t have to start huge, but you do need realistic expectations about what’s possible.

**Bottom Line**

Day trading isn’t the glamorous, quick-money lifestyle most people think it is. It’s a grind, it’s boring when done right, and it takes years to develop the skills and mindset needed to survive. If you’re still reading this and it doesn’t scare you off, that’s a good sign... you might have the patience and discipline to actually stick it out. Follow me for my next post.

Nobody teaches how to actually think in markets. Like: how to reason under uncertainty; how to weigh asymmetric risk; how to survive when nothing makes sense; how to see crowd behavior or feedback loops (Soros level stuff); how to ask “what game am I really playing?”

See, if I could restart, I’d focus on one style instead of bouncing between scalping, swing trading, and whatever strategy I saw online. Ive noticed that's what a lot of you guys do, and thays what I did when i was new to trading too. 

That constant switching wasted years. See, I’d build a simple, rule-based system around one setup, journal every trade, and treat it like a business from day one. Journaling felt pointless when I started, it really did... but in reality it was the only thing that forced me to see patterns in my wins and losses. On top of that, I’d make risk management non-negotiable. Back then I thought max loss rules and position sizing were things for “later,” but they’re what would have kept me from blowing up accounts and losing confidence early. Surviving year one should be the real goal, not doubling your account. Just surviving.

The other big shift would be mindset. I wasted too much time idolizing gurus and searching for a magic indicator, when in reality every trader I know who’s still around relies on discipline, execution, and patience. The edge isn’t a secret tool... it’s following your plan even when it’s boring. I also would’ve treated my capital like a startup investment, not gambling money.

Support/resistance, supply/demand, SMC, VWAP, trendlines, whatever your flavor is, the math usually checks out.



So why do most traders still lose?



Because it’s not a strategy problem.

It’s a self-control problem.



Everyone thinks they’ll follow their rules. Until they take a loss.

Or miss a move.

Or get bored at 11am and click something ""just to feel alive.”



The winners?

They aren’t more educated. They aren’t smarter.

They’re just more disciplined and they’ve built systems around that discipline.



• They only take A+ setups

• They pre-plan their session the night before

• They never deviate from their risk per trade

• They review every mistake, no matter how small

• They stay consistent even on the boring days



Trading doesn’t get easier.

You just get better at sticking to the plan.

And that part takes time.



Some traders need 5 years to figure this out.

Others get there in 1, if they’re honest with themselves early.

It personally took me 3.5 years and 1.5 years of consistent journaling + backtesting with a proper tool.



But no one skips the internal work.

1jyli1w,2025-04-13,2025-04-13 19:51:24,How to Win The Game of Trading.,"This is a comprehensive read for anyone who is new to trading or is not profitable yet.



1. The Illusion of Profits.

	Most people join trading just because they see others getting rich from it. Everyone wants to get rich and they want to get rich fast. The game of trading is zero sum game. Meaning whatever money you make is lost by someone for you to make it. There is a general rule 90-90-90, 90% of people lose 90% of their money in the first 90 days of trading.



1. What do you Trade?

	there are many options, you can trade stocks, forex, crypto and more.

	if you decide to trade stocks then you need something called a stock screener, you need to lookout for a thing called earnings reports because that usually means there will be big movement on that stock.

If you trade forex then you need to understand currency strength, a little bit of geopolitics, interest rates and more things like core inflation. As for crypto I have no idea, my subjective opinion is that it is a fundamentally worthless asset only driven by sentiment.



1. Leverage.

	What is leverage? Leverage is your ability to buy or sell more of an asset than you can afford. A 1:100 leverage means, you can buy a 100 dollar asset for 1 dollar. But it also means that 1% movement in that asset would result in liquidation of your account. Leverage Does not change your P&L, lot size does. Leverage only allows you to increase what lot size trades you can enter.

At 0.01 lot size, your P&L is exactly the movement in asset price. If the asset moves 1 dollar up in value, then your profit is 1 dollar. If it moves 1 dollar down in value then your loss is 1 dollar.

You increase the lot size to 0.1 then 1 dollar change would result in 10 dollar P&L and at 1.0 lot size a 1 Dollar change results in 100 Dollar P&L.

Your effective leverage is different than your account leverage. Let’s say your account leverage is 1:100, asset price is 100. That means the margin required to enter a trade is 1 dollar only. how do you decide what effective margin is good for you? If your capital is large enough then just risking 0.5% or 1% should make you decent money. But if you wanna get risky then decide your effective leverage based on the largest dip any given asset has had in its history.

Let’s talk about XAU/USD. The biggest dip was 13% in one day. So at an effective leverage of 1:8 (100/8=12.5) should be okay for gold. So even if gold dips by 12.4% you will not be liquidated. Keep some extra money in case of a margin call. But as a trader a margin call should never be your concern. Always manage your risk.



1. Strategy.

	no matter what you are trading, you will need a strategy. Without strategy everything is useless. In Reality when you trade you are in competition not with other retail traders, but with institutions, hedge funds and algorithms. These are the people who just trade for a living, people with PHD’s in mathematics. So you need a strategy. That is your edge, your alpha. And overtime in a big enough time frame your alpha will decay, so you need to be dynamic. Some commonly used strategies are Support/Resistance, ICT, SMT, FVG, IFVG, Fib. If you do not have an edge then you ARE the edge. 



1. Win Rate.

	your risk to reward ratio should be a little consistent. At an RR of 1:2 at 35% win rate you will be profitable. Not a lot but yes you will be profitable. At an RR of 1:10 you will be profitable at 9.2% win rate. You will find a lot of different images online showing you breakeven percentage for different win rates and profit percentage for different win rates.



1. Discipline. 

	Trading is 50% strategy and 50% discipline. Let’s say you win two trades in a row and made 200 dollars. You are now emotional, your emotion makes you think one more trade won’t hurt and you know you will win right? And then you proceed to end up loosing what you made. Let’s say you lost money in both your trades instead of winning, now you are revenge trading and want to make your money back. ONLY RISK THE MONEY YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE. A general rule should be 2 trades max per any given asset per day and 5 total trades in any given day. For some people just sitting there and watching it go down is mentally taxing. That does not mean trading is not for you, that means you set your TP and SL based on your strategic needs and turn off your laptop or desktop for the day and get to doing other things.



1. Paper trading.

	Paper trade for 4 months to get an idea of the markets, learn about pips, slippage, ticks, SL, TP and events that affect your asset class, like earnings reports for stocks and FOMC events for Forex. 4 months so that no matter your asset class its enough for you to see a couple of earnings reports or at least one FED event. Try not to trade news, volatility might liquidate you. Whiplashes might liquidate you.



1. Stop Loss.

	Always set a Stop Loss. Based on your strategy your stop loss might differ but i do not know any strategy that does not need one. Stop loss is the first step to good risk management. NO MATTER WHAT ALWAYS SET A STOP LOSS. It’s okay to skip setting a TP but never okay to skip a STOP LOSS. 



1. F&O Trading.

	This is a subjective opinion you can choose to ignore, F&O is made for Hedging. Meaning let’s say you have a big investment position or a swing trade open in any asset. the asset going down in value would mean floating losses which you cannot sustain then for the equal or less amount of shares you buy a put option 3-24 months out for that asset. You keep rolling your option, meaning whenever you are 25-50% of the way to your expiry you roll the put so that you do not have to pay the full price for the next put and you do not lose money due to time decay. (If you were unfamiliar with any of these terms then you have a long way to go in futures and options.) 



Also another opinion of mine is that you trade options not futures so you do not have an obligation.



Again it is a zero sum game, some options go up thousands of percentages in value, IT DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL MAKE THAT MUCH MONEY FROM YOUR OPTION. Generally in a non volatile market you barely make double digit percentages let alone triple. futures and options do not move in congruence to the asset price, they move relative to the asset price. There is IV crushes, time decay and skew. 



Even for trading normal asset classes a good expectation would be 0.5-4% returns weekly. You do not need to trade daily, wait for good entry for your trades. You do not need to trade every single big move, never have FOMO. There will always be another opportunity. There are lots of people out there ready to become liquidity for you at any given moment if you have strategy and discipline.



If you trade stocks then on average they move 0.5% to 10% MAX. Thats once in three months during earnings report or some extremely good or extremely horrid news. Otherwise you do not get such moves, and the chances of you screening the stock and catching that move and not getting stopped out are low. Not 0 but low. So again a good expectation of returns is 0.5% to 4% MAX a week.



1. Risk Management.

	ONLY RISK 0.5% to 1.0% on each trade. It might seem minuscule but overtime your capital will grow if your edge is reliable. Once your position is in some profit, set a trailing stop loss, consistently trail it as price moves. Move it to breakeven once you are 50% to your tp, move it to 50% when you are 80% of the way to your TP. 



Some more things to consider is to learn what is a pip, how to calculate it, what are spreads and how they differ, whether your broker is a market maker or not. Roll over or swap fees for swing positions. 



HOW TO BE A SUCCESSFUL TRADER?



Get to work 30 minutes before market open, read finance news letters it could be any 2 newsletters of your choice that give you all the compiled information of everything you need. If you are trading FOREX then check forexfactory for any events for the day. Determine a bias for your asset whether its bullish or bearish and only enter in the direction of the bias (trend) if the market is bearish and you GO SHORT. Regardless of how fundamentally valuable the asset is.



Mark out trading zones for the day. Set alerts so you are notified everytime price reaches close to your zone. So you can do other work and do not have to be stuck to your computer. 



Journal your trades, track your stats like win rate, risk reward, max drawdown, emotion and other things.



Understand your equity curve, make sure its your edge that is making you money and not other things, because sometimes even for 3-5 months people consistently make money without edge only to realise its cause market moved in their favouring direction, not because their trades were actually working.





SPICY STUFF



If you go against what any good trader has to say and you trade news or you trade futures and options especially during volatility then I suggest you learn what straddles are and what hedging is. You make money regardless of whether the asset price goes up or down. But then you have to wait for a while before there is a retracement for your opposing position to be profitable or breakeven. Still straddling is better than mindlessly trading F&O or news. 





THIS IS STILL NOT THE FULL PICTURE



This is still not the full picture when it comes to trading, there are dark pools, there are brokers that bet against you, taxes and regulations once you are finally profitable, fear and greed indexes, overfitting during backtesting or lookahead, positive or negative co-relation between assets, macroeconomics, price manipulation, HFT front running news or just high volume trades or any big juicy candle, Kelly criterion and a ton of other stuff.

Check my previous post for more details!

# Idea

Stochastic is a momentum indicator, very similar to another indicators (like RSI).  
As the study shows, it is very good for entry. But to use it for exit, you need to trade Trend Following.  
We will look at how it can be used for Mean Reversion.

The indicator produces two lines and takes two periods. Unfortunately we will not use both, as the second one is just an average for the first one. ('D' line is not used in strategy).

>*Please don't take the title of the post or the pictures to heart. Do your research!*

# Strategy

* **Instrument**: US100 (NQ), US500 (ES)
* **TF**: 1D (*The strategy does not work on time frames below)*
* **Initial Capital:** 10k$
* **Lots (In money)**: 500$
* **Data Period**: 2012.01.19 - 2024.11.28

*The strategy buys only if there are no open trades. That is, there can be only 1 trade at a time.*  
*The strategy does not have a shortsell trades as instrument is often in the uptrend.*

***Inputs:***

1. K\_Period: **1**/2/3
2. LowTh: 10/15/20/**25**/35/45/50

*D\_Period=1*  
*Slowing=0*

**Buy Rules:** Stoch(K\_Period, D\_Period, Slowing).Fast < LowTh  
*Fast is 'K' Line*  
**Filter**: Close > SMA(200) (Optionally)  
**Close Rule**: Close > High\[1\]  
*So yesterday's close was higher than the day before that*

Since it is a [Mean Reversion](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/mean-reversion) strategy:  
**I do not recommend using the Stop Loss** as it increases the drawdown and reduces the profit.  
**I don’t recommend using Take Profit** as it reduces profits.

# Conclusions

1. Stochastic is perfect for entry, but bad for exit.
2. Works well on all MR instruments
3. 76% winrate, which is pretty normal for Mean Reversion.
4. The strategy has almost no optimization, but it works with the same parameters on all MR instruments.
5. You are free to choose when to exit the position.
6. Simple risk management is already doing more than the return of US100 with much lower drawdowns (7+ return / dd ratio)
7. Sharpe Ratio > 1, which is very rare for MR strategies.

>*Your task as a trader is to do more profit than an investor in the same time period on the same instrument.*  
*It can be done with a* ***portfolio of strategies***\*. With the right risk management it is possible to do it with a single strategy\*!",137,46,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1hk6h46/826_yearly_stochastic_mean_reversion/,year,Strategy,0.95
1lspk55,2025-07-05,2025-07-05 21:35:25,Discipline Isn’t Waking Up at 4AM,"Everyone talks about discipline like it’s a vibe. 
Wake up at 4am. Cold plunge. Read 10 pages. Meditate. No days off.
But that’s aesthetic discipline, it looks good. It feels productive.
But if you’re still chasing random trades at 8:47am… none of that matters.
Real discipline is:
Not clicking buy even when the setup looks good, but doesn’t follow your rules.


Sitting through a boring market because it’s not your environment.


Logging out with a $40 profit because that was the plan instead of turning it into a -$200 red day chasing dopamine.


Journaling that one mistake you keep making… and actually correcting it the next day.


Discipline isn’t loud.
It’s not flashy.
It’s not IG-story friendly.
But it pays.
And it stacks.
And it makes your life calm, not chaotic.
Most people are addicted to hype, motivation, and momentum.
Discipline is doing the exact opposite.
Even when it sucks.
Even when nobody claps for it.
Even when you don’t feel like it.
That’s why most people never get consistent.

Let me know if you want help with building structure around your trades.

1mtbv6k,2025-08-18,2025-08-18 00:06:59,Simple process I used to turn around my trading.,"I struggled alot my first few years. Even during bull markets. I was exceptionally bad.

Of everything I tried the only that that has worked for me was finding ways to remove trades. I started going through every single trade quarterly and yearly with the sole objective of finding simple systematic rules that would cleave off a chunk of losers without removing too many winners and ideally no big winners.

Here are some of the simple rules I implemented:  
  
1. Small cap gappers. I see big candle and can't help but think, I must find a way to capture some of that. After years of trying, I failed. I had a few meager wins, and tons of losses. Rather then trying to figure out how to make it work, I decided to give up and not trade them at all. At the time, these made up roughly 15% of my losses, and basically no gains.

2. Trades past 9am (pst). This was a tricky one to notice but I have timestamps when I download my executions and once I filtered for these, the results were embarrassing. I don't remember the exact figures, but it was something like 3 wins and 40 losses. I felt like an idiot for not realizing this earlier. Many people trade throughout the day, and especially the last hour with success. I am not one of those people.

3. Biotech stocks. Many swing traders like myself trade these with success. I have no idea what I'm missing, but these categorically give me almost no winners. 

4. Low ATR (low volatility stocks). I technically was slightly worse off completely removing these but the meager gains and capital they required weren't worth the trouble.

I haven't really changed much about the rest of my strategy. Here are some rough estimates of my results:

Year 1: 800 trades, -50%  
Year 2: 600 trades, -30%  
Year 3: 250 trades, 20%  
Year 4: 150 trades, 80%

The results themselves maybe aren't that impressive, but I went from losing money and miserably trading all day to 1 hour for post-market prep, and watch/trade the markets the first 2 hours.",129,43,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1mtbv6k/simple_process_i_used_to_turn_around_my_trading/,year,Advice,0.96
1jourtt,2025-04-01,2025-04-01 08:49:33,80% Yearly Returns Trading Big Caps - My Basic Tips,"

First things first, trading for a living is going to take time. I explained this in my last post. This requires a tremendous amount of screen time. But guess what? So does every other profession. The reward from this is much greater so why on earth would anyone think it can be done without tons of studying. 



Choose your battle. Trading is amazing and I don't need to tell you why, you already know them that's why you're here. It takes time but it's doable and rewarding.



I'm not the best trader. I strive for a 80%+ yearly return. Risking too much is the fastest way to say goodbye to your dreams. This is a probability game after all. Big gains also mean big losses or frequent smaller losses.



All you need is basic support and resistance and so do every other full-time stock trader I know of - me included.



So this will not be about some *''liquidity level2 0.69 fibonacci grab''*\- method. 



**This is about understanding the fundamentals of stock trading and so you can be one step closer to consistent wins. Month after month.** 



If you trade forex or any other markets then this will not be for you. (You shouldn't btw but that's for another time).



I see way too many destructible posts about people making 100k starting from 1k. That's pure gambling and if that's what you want then this post is not for you either.

Anyone can put 1k on green in roulette and make 36k or whatever. Trading is a business and a fulltime job where you run it like any other business, long hours, tons of discipline, and you rely on consistent returns.



If you only want to be rich then it's easier to start some other business.



Okay enough rambling.



1. **A simple strategy for trading stocks (In this current market)**



\-Only use the daily and the 15m chart. Both have to trend in the same direction - Always start with looking at the daily chart. YOu want to see a nice trend over the past month. Vice versa for shorts.



\-Only trade big caps with volume (10b+). Why? Because you don't want the stock to reverse because Johns's grandma was selling her bag when you went long. Big caps tend to respect technicals more and they require big money to move (institutions) - this is where you want to be.



\-Use the 10ema intraday and on the daily chart you want the 50 SMA and 200 SMA. Later on you can add/play around with 8ema/15ema/21ema to fit your personality but for now, let's keep it simple.



\-Be ready to swing and day trade. The market right now is in a difficult swing environment so you stick to day trading. The market conditions will change from time to time and you need to have a diversified toolbox.

\-Draw horizontal support and resistance levels from the daily chart, and also trendlines.

\-Do not chase a stock. Let the opportunity come to you.

\-Don't trade the OPEN

\-Never counter-trend trade. The stock is down for the day? Don't go long and vice versa. Best setups happen when the stock is above or below yesterday's high/low.

\-Don't trade EARNINGS

\-Look for smooth bullish charts on the daily for longs and vice versa for shorts

\-Look for stocks that are above/low yesterdays high/low. 

\-You want to see above average volume

\-Learn different basic options strategies such as debit/credit spreads, puts, and calls, and how they work in general. Don't buy OTM calls/puts. More on that some other time.



\-Always trade in the direction of SPX/SPY and QQQ. I call it the ''market''. If the market is down, look for shorts, if it's up, look for longs.  

\-Don't trade the market itself, it's harder and unnecessary.





The market will drag most of the stocks with it, so going long a stock when the market is going down is like surfing with bad waves. You won't get far. Wait for the market and your stock will surf smoother.



Examples of a few trades I took:



Market: As we don't have a clear direction for swings, I stick to day trading for now. Market is bearish and I've been focusing on finding stocks to short.



This is the kind of daily chart you're looking for, even if you're day trading only. Clear bearish trend with a technical break.



Got an alert on a bearish break on $AVGO on the daily chart. At the same time, the market was struggling to get above its 200 SMA. The market showed its weakness with a bearish flush in the first 15 minutes and it held nicely under the 10 sma, the longer it held the more bearish I became for the day.



This is how the market looked on 26.3-28.3.

[SPY 15m ](https://preview.redd.it/mnkv7ay2o7se1.png?width=971&format=png&auto=webp&s=321ab30d70a3ca78f424c7cf3f6152abd2524f2c)

Then let's look at my pick $AVGO from a daily chart first:

[AVGO daily chart. Nice bearish trend. This is what you are looking for when finding shorts.](https://preview.redd.it/3rl8ompfo7se1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=a99035a19654fb1cb284ffc7e17dde0d182ea13b)

  
Next, we look at the intraday where I shorted. Because in this market I don't want to swing yet.

[AVGO 15m chart. Compare it to the SPY chart above and you can see why and where I shorted.](https://preview.redd.it/43iep6lpo7se1.png?width=1215&format=png&auto=webp&s=af99f2e5dfa75b0d8e4a15d901f429fabb8861c2)

Now, I could have held my first short position overnight and made massive profits instead of just daytrading it. But the thing is, the market could have easily gapped up the next day and all my profits could have been gone. Just look at SPY and you can see that there has not been very good swing opportunities in the last week. 

This is how I trade week after week. When the market conditions changes, so do my trading. But the fundamentals are always the same - 

Bullish stocks& Bullish market = long

Bearish stock&bearish market=short 

  
Now, go find 5 bullish stocks and 5 bearish stocks from the daily chart. Make sure they are not near a support/resistance level. Keep them on your watchlist while you look at the market during the day, when you are sure of a direction (bullish/bearish spy) take a position in the best stock in your watchlist that is above it's yesterdays high/low. 

This is something you should not do with REAL money for now. It's only for practice. You will get in the flow of the whole market and learn when to enter/exit. Focus on intraday trading only for this. 

Look for smooth stocks, no crazy candles and make sure it has no upcoming earnings this week.

Some bearish stock examples I look for in this current market (daily chart).

[NKE](https://preview.redd.it/gzmdlkcdy7se1.png?width=1497&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e791aa7c89ffe89c1fe1246e2082e4a0f9611ab)

After I find these stocks i put them on my watchlist and I trade them if the market condition is favorable.

Same thing for longs in a bullish market (which it is not).

I also scan during the day over 400 stocks every now and then to see if something is building up. 

  
Okay that's it for now, keep studying and I'm here to help if you have questions.

I feel completely trapped, and I don’t know how to move forward. I’ve made the same mistake over and over again, and now it feels like there’s no way out.

Over the past few years, I borrowed money from my sister three separate times, believing I could make it back through trading crypto. Each time, I convinced myself that I had learned from my mistakes, that I would be more disciplined, that this time it would be different. But I was wrong. Every single time, I lost everything.

Now, I am in the worst financial situation of my life. I have no savings, a mountain of debt, and absolutely no one left to turn to. I’m ashamed, I feel like a failure, and I can’t even bring myself to talk to my sister about it again. She helped me when she could, and I threw it all away chasing a dream that I couldn’t make work.

I’m currently drowning in **loans and credit card debt that far exceed my monthly salary**, and even though I still have a job, I don’t see a way to cover my obligations without getting even deeper into the hole. The anxiety is crushing me, and I don’t know what to do. I keep going back and forth between trying to trade my way out of this or just giving up completely. But I know that trying to gamble my way out is what got me here in the first place.

What scares me the most is that even now, despite everything, my mind keeps convincing me that if I could just lower my debt to a more manageable level, I could still make money from trading and fix everything. I’ve gone through this cycle so many times—telling myself that I only need to make $80-100 a day for six months to get back on track, and for a while, I did. But the moment I started losing, I instantly took out more credit and threw it back into the market without a second thought. I’ve even received payouts from prop firms a couple of times, but it always ended the same way. The fact that I still have this mindset, even now, terrifies me. I feel like I can’t stop myself.

I don’t know what I’m hoping to get out of posting this. Maybe advice? Maybe just someone to tell me I’m not completely alone in this? If anyone has ever been in a situation like this and managed to get out, I would love to hear how you did it. Right now, I feel like I’ve destroyed my future and there’s no coming back from this.

After 4 years of bouncing between stocks, options, futures, and even a bit of forex, I’ve finally reached consistent profitability with futures. The last 12 months have been green, not Lambo-level gains but steady growth, strict risk management, and full control over my emotions.

Like most of you, I went through every strategy, indicator, and random YouTube rabbit hole out there. But what changed everything was journaling, backtesting my setups, and building a process I could actually trust. Trading stopped feeling like gambling once I had real data and structure behind my decisions.

I know how frustrating this journey can get especially when you're doing everything ""right"" but still not seeing results. If you’re struggling with strategy, psychology, risk, or just want to bounce ideas, feel free to ask. Happy to help however I can.

No I don't have a discord or youtube, I know trust is hard to earn in this space full of fakes and hype. If you’ve got any tips on how to build something transparent and real, I’d love to hear them and share it here for everyone to learn and get some value.

Wishing you all the best on your journey.

And no, I don’t sell any courses, signals, or mentorship. I’m not here to market anything. Just speaking facts.

Trading can absolutely be a full-time career, but it’s not a shortcut, not a game, and definitely not for the weak-hearted. It demands discipline, patience, brutal honesty with yourself, and an obsession with learning — every single day. There are no guarantees, only probabilities. You’ll face doubt, losses, and moments when quitting seems easier. That’s when most people fall off.

But if you treat trading like a real business, study the craft deeply, control your emotions, and learn from your mistakes without blaming the market — yes, it’s possible. I’m living proof of that. And I’m still learning, evolving, and building.

So to anyone asking, is it possible to trade for a living?
Yes. But only if you’re willing to go through the fire for it.",126,66,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1kuhi0v/trading_strategy/,year,Strategy,0.93
1na0nug,2025-09-06,2025-09-06 10:16:18,Walking away from a hedge fund desk to trade my own algos was the hardest (and scariest) decision I ever made…,"I used to sit behind a multi-monitor setup at a family office, surrounded by PhDs and ex-bank quants. On paper, it was the dream job: stable pay, access to capital, and the illusion of prestige. But here’s the part no one tells you, most hedge funds don’t actually innovate. They recycle the same old factor models, fight for scraps of alpha, and drown in bureaucracy.

Meanwhile, the retail world has quietly evolved. With today’s tech, a small team (or even a single obsessed coder) can build strategies that rival or outperform what we ran in-house. The structural edge hedge funds used to have is gone, execution costs are near zero, APIs are wide open, and cloud compute is dirt cheap.

So I left. I poured everything into designing and stress-testing my own systems. Not flashy, not “get rich quick” nonsense — just robust, data-driven algos running across multiple markets.

What surprised me most wasn’t the returns (though those shocked me too)… it was the freedom. Not having to answer to an IC committee, not having to pitch every idea, not being capped by arbitrary risk budgets. Just pure research → code → live execution.

I’ll be honest: it’s terrifying sometimes. But when I look at my equity curves now (screenshots attached), I can’t help but think this was the right move.

Curious if anyone else here has taken the leap from “institutional” to “independent”? Do you feel like retail strategies are actually more agile now than what big funds are running?

These six things finally helped me stop:

* Only took trades during my best hours. If the edge wasn’t there, neither was I. For me that's the first 2 hrs of NY and the last hour (power hour) We do tend to get nice reversals in power hour.
* Zoomed out. Watching every micro candle made me impulsive. 
* Walked away after setting alerts. No more screen addiction. I set alerts at the levels that my setup might form, usually daily o session high/lows.
* Tracked forced trades inside TradeZella. Patterns exposed themselves. Really put it in front of your face, as humans, it's easy for us to ignore our problems unless it's very apparent.
* Focused on quality: 1 A+ setup > 5 random stabs.
* Made cash a position. Doing nothing became part of the strategy. I struggled with this mostly, I thought I had to trade every single day and that's far from the truth.

I began by soaking up free content on YouTube from various experienced traders. Their insights were eyeopening and helped me understand the basics, but I quickly realized that to really grow, I needed more structured learning

I looked into premium trading courses online, but they were way out of my budget at first. Still, I kept grinding diving deep into trading forums, reading everything I could find about market psychology, risk management, and technical setups. After months of selfstudy, I invested more time and money into learning by purchasing some courses and dedicating myself fully to mastering the craft.

From there, I studied hard and applied what I learned every day focusing on strategies like trend following, momentum plays, and managing position sizes carefully. About three months in, I started noticing real gains. My confidence grew as my trades became more consistent and profitable

Fast forward to now, and I’ve made over $72K trading by combining solid education, disciplined risk management, and patience. Trading isn’t easy or guaranteed, but with the right mindset and resources, it can definitely pay off

1ixvs7w,2025-02-25,2025-02-25 09:06:43,Trading is stacking skillsets,"Hi all,

As a husband, a dad of five, and a full-time trader, I’ve experienced firsthand the challenges and rewards that come with making trading a full-time career. It’s been a journey of growth, discipline, and constant learning.

Over time, I’ve gathered insights that have helped me navigate some of the highs and lows, and I figured they might be valuable to others as well.

Whether you're considering making trading your full-time career or just looking to refine your approach, I hope you find something useful here.

**Here's my post:**

I was chatting with my wife the other day, trying to explain how I’ve learned to trade.  
She’s an incredible cook, so I explained it to her like this:

""It’s like how you first started learning to cook sourdough bread.""

""Okay, can you expand?"" she asked, rightly.

""When you first started learning how to bake sourdough bread, there were a few different skills you had to master for the end result to work.

Making sourdough requires a few things: a starter, the right mixture of ingredients, the correct amount of kneading, and the bake settings and timeframe must be just right.

You then had to develop the skill to master each part. It took practice and patience to get the starter just right. Understanding the nuance of mixing the ingredients took time. You had to learn how long to knead. Getting the right bake settings took reps to perfect.

And after every loaf that wasn’t up to par, you had to review, problem-solve, and make notes on what to adjust next time.

The reality is that when you made your first sourdough, there was no way you could get every part right the first time, or the second, third, or fourth.

It takes reps to get each part right, and only after mastering each aspect can everything come together into something delicious.”

Individual skill sets, when combined, give us the results we want in our trading: product, setup, market conditions, volume, price action, execution, all while managing risk. We then combine them all to hopefully get something good.

She wasn’t as excited about this analogy as I was, but she said she got the gist.

# Where Most New Traders Get It Wrong

Trying to learn a new skill is like trying to drink from a fire hose, especially in the beginning. It’s overwhelming, you're trying to do too many things at once, and you're unsure if you're making progress at all.

Despair quickly sets in, and you feel like quitting.

It can be incredibly frustrating, and it's a big reason why the dropout rate in trading is so high.

But there is a solution.

# A Different Recipe

Instead of trying to learn trading all at once, break it down into individual skills to master.""

Then, learn those skills one at a time, all while keeping losses small (because we’re going to mess up in the beginning, A LOT). You can still place trades while you learn, but think of it as your tuition. And why pay more tuition than you need to?

Here’s how to do it:

**1. First, learn about the job.**

If there was a job posting, here’s a summary of your daily tasks:

* Figure out where the money is flowing (finding stocks to trade).
* Identify the most common patterns (setups).
* Develop a game plan to trade these patterns (strategy).

Later on:

* Which patterns are you best at? (Use your journaling data).
* Scale up on your best patterns (start increasing risk, slowly).
* Marry market environment to specific patterns (pay attention to the market—it’s a tailwind).

There are countless books and resources that can expand on what trading is really like. I personally like SMB Capital’s YouTube library of videos (their early videos are great and free).

**2. Then learn the skill of losing less than you make.**

Keeping your money safe is the most important part of trading. Now, read that again.

I’m serious. If you can’t get the risk management part right, it’s over. But don’t worry, it’s much less complicated than we think.

Here are a few tips:

* When entering any trade, think *risk-first*. Don’t think about what you can make, first, think about how much you could lose. Now, read that again.
* Think in terms of basic math: If your average winning day is $50, your daily max loss should be no more than 1-2 days' worth of gains.
* This is why being specific in your entries is so crucial. You may only get one entry on the day, so you need to make it count. If you think you may need two attempts, risk half your max loss for a ticker, that way you still have ammo left.
* These amounts will become clearer over time and should generally be a percentage of your average daily win amount.

**3. Learn the skill of managing yourself.**

As you start to trade more, you’ll want to do some stupid stuff, some of which you won’t be able to explain. So, you need to figure out how to “tame the dragon” before that happens. (Or was it a werewolf? Same idea.)

Don’t worry, it’s not that complicated. It really comes down to your systems and how well you can follow them.

Think of McDonald’s making a burger: They have a system for making a Big Mac, and all you need to do is stick to the steps, and you’ll be fine. You get into trouble when you start making it up, that’s when you get frustrated and start throwing burgers at the wall. Why not avoid it altogether?

Learn to write everything down to make it easy and repeatable. Write down things like your checklist for finding the right stocks, maybe a process for how to judge a setup, or a journal entry you read each morning. Whatever the system looks like for you, it’s a skill set that must be learned.

*Also, keeping your trade size small throughout your learning process will really help take away a lot of the emotion and make things a lot easier. I talking 1-4 shares.*

**4. Learn the skill of operating like a business.**

You’re going to have costs, systems, and standard operating procedures, and it’s going to take a while to figure out; just like any other business.

You’ll also need to learn all about order entries and what works best for you.

Learn what tools you need by always starting with the free version if it’s offered, and only pay for something if there’s no other way around it.

A journaling service, live market data, and a simple stock scanner are often the first expenses you’ll incur. I like Edgewonk, Interactive Brokers, and Chart Watcher because they’re affordable and they work.

**5. Learn the skill of learning.**

As the sole business owner, when things hit the fan, you’re the only one who can fix it and make it better. And that’s a skill set.

When you’re in a drawdown (a fancy word for “you suck” right now), you need to be able to identify what’s causing the issue, take the emotion out, and resolve it.

Just like with our sourdough recipe in the beginning, if the bread doesn’t come out properly, you need to be able to identify what changes need to be made.

Learn how to learn.

# Finding Your Path

Remember, you’re learning each skill separately. That’s the secret; breaking down trading into easy-to-digest, bite-sized pieces. And as you learn, start stacking each skill set.

At first it feels slow, like you’re barely making progress. But just like baking the perfect sourdough, the small improvements compound.

Over time, what once felt overwhelming becomes second nature. One day, you’ll realize you’re no longer second-guessing every decision, your process feels natural, and your results start to reflect the effort you’ve put in.

Trading isn’t about mastering everything at once, it’s about consistently refining each piece until the whole thing works together.

So keep stacking those skills, keep refining the recipe, and eventually, you’ll be executing those perfect trades.",120,25,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ixvs7w/trading_is_stacking_skillsets/,year,Advice,0.95

Check my previous post for more details!

# Idea

Almost all price-action indicators provide a delay.  
What if I told you that you could remove or reduce this delay? In this strategy we explore **Laguerre RSI.**

This is a slightly modified RSI that works without Lookback Period. Instead it takes the value for the adaptive filter. In fact, it is an oscillator that gives us values from 0.0 to 1.0.

# Strategy

* **Instrument**: US100 (NQ)
* **TF**: 1D (*The strategy does not work on time frames below)*
* **Initial Capital:** 10k$
* **Risked Money**: 500$
* **Data Period**: 2012.01.19 - 2024.11.28

*The strategy buys only if there are no open trades. That is, there can be only 1 trade at a time.*  
*The strategy does not have a shortsell trades as instrument is often in the uptrend.*

***Inputs:***

1. Gamma - **0.3**/0.4/0.5
2. LagLow - **0.2**/0.25/0.3
3. LagHigh - **0.6**/0.7/0.8

**Buy Rule:** LagRSI(Gamma) < Low

**Close Rule**: LagRSI(Gamma) > High. Exit on friday. Exit after 30 days.  
*You can experiment with the close rule: select another indicator, period, a certain price level, day or just close at the first successful closing of the price (close of candlestick > buy price)*

Since it is a [Mean Reversion](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/mean-reversion) strategy:  
**I do not recommend using the Stop Loss** as it increases the drawdown and reduces the profit.  
**I don’t recommend using Take Profit** as it reduces profits.

# Conclusions

1. Works well with absolutely any input parameters on the specified instruments. This is a good signal of robustness!
2. Slightly correlated with the previous one, as it uses RSI formula for entry.
3. Works well without filters.
4. Return/DD Ratio and Sharpe Ratio are much better than the usual RSI, although the winrate is almost the same.
5. The strategy is very sensitive to exit conditions. Try changing the indicator or rules. I think it makes sense to make a non-symmetric exit.

Where to start, I feel ashamed and hopeless. I entered the world of trading 4 years ago, in the crypto boom of 2021. And here we are today, 4 years later, and each time I think I know less. Is this even possible? 

I consider myself a normal person, I'm a chemical engineer, but my work doesn't satisfy me, and I promised myself that it would be this art of trading, with a lot of effort and dedication, that would elevate me and provide a life worth living. 

I always knew that there were no shortcuts, I never fell for the scam of thinking that this was easy money... but how can I tell the people closest to me that after so much dedication, after so many times telling my wife that I couldn't do it now, or that I'm busy when I'm looking at charts and have nothing to show for it, if you'd taken the other side of all my trades until now, you'd be millionaires, I'm consisntent on losing money. 

And I even played poker semi-professionally, multi-tabling with 16 tables, and it was profitable, I thought trading was just another similar game, with a defined risk reward and that it was a question of knowing the game.

But no, I know that there's nothing you can tell me that will miraculously make me profitable, and part of me would like to forget that I ever started this journey, because now I feel that if I never manage to reach the profitability that I've failed to achieve in my life.

For example, Who would’ve thought that we would be at all-time highs in less than two months? It’s over 2500 point round trip move in the S&P since April…think of the wealth transfer that just happened in less than 60 days. The year is not even over yet. A lot of folks think now there’s no where else to go but up. You know, the market only goes up. However, what if I told you the market is going be at this years lows in less than 30 days, would you believe me after making all time highs?

This volatility is amazing. However, don’t underestimate the swings we will continue to have for the foreseeable future.",115,33,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1lq6w3z/learn_to_not_trade/,year,Futures,0.97
1hr70ra,2025-01-01,2025-01-01 12:01:59,The ONLY 2 Indicators You Need,"Happy New Year everyone! Let's start 2025 off with a bang.

In this post, I want to share with you the ONLY 2 indicators you really need to trade stocks successfully.

Sure, you most likely use other indicators that you feel give you conviction to take a trade, be it RSI, Moving Averages, Fibonacci etc.

Whatever it is, they’re all going to be lagging indicators, meaning that they all just follow what price does.

However, the following two indicators are REAL TIME and tell you 90% of what you need to know about the direction of a stock, and that’s…

**Volume and Relative Volume (RVOL).**

I know, these indicators are not new wonderful revelations, but you’d be surprised by how many traders do not apply them properly.

Let me give you some major reasons exactly how these indicators can help you.

\--------------------------------------------

Let’s begin with Volume.

Volume is typically shown below the stock chart as a bar. It’ll be measured as dollar amount (how much money has been traded) or a share amount (how many shares have been traded). It doesn’t really matter which type of volume you use; they both follow the same concept.

When it comes to analysing a stock, I put a lot of emphasis on how much volume there is at the END of the day (when the bar has been completed) – obviously we don’t know how much volume there’ll end up being if it’s any earlier; the volume could completely drop off mid-day.

Anyway, here are two ways Volume can help you:

# 1. Institutional Buying

When the big boys (i.e. banks, hedge funds, pension funds etc.) buy, they will leave footprints behind. Their buying power is so much bigger than retail investors so it’ll be apparent in the volume bar, and they won’t buy all in one go, they’ll buy in stages, so price is likely to be supported and continue rising.

So when you see a huge volume bar at crucial moments (e.g. when a sold is considered oversold or after a major catalyst), you can bet that institutions are piling into the stock. This can be a good time to buy – whether you want to be conservative and average into the stock or buy all at once, that’s up to you.

# 2. A True Bounce

When the market/stock is in a downtrend, how do you know when it’s really over?

There’s going to be a lot of dead cat bounces that fool traders into thinking it’s the start of a new uptrend, only for price to make a lower low.

The key is to wait for signs of institutional accumulation that show up in the form of volume and support – don’t just blindly buy on ‘dips’ or guesswork because trying to time the bottom without confirmation is a recipe for disaster.

So when you see several gap downs on huge volume and price consolidates then makes a higher low, then there’s a high chance that the market/stock has bottomed.

\--------------------------------------------

Now let’s move onto Relative Volume (RVOL).

This indicator compares a stock’s current amount of volume with its previously traded volume over a certain period of time. This is either measured as a percentage or ratio, depending on the platform you’re using.

The higher the RVOL is, the more buyers and sellers are participating in that stock at that particular moment – this is about as real-time as you get.

So let’s see how RVOL can you help you with your trading:

# 1. Trading Breakouts

Breakouts are annoying to play (just my opinion!) because there are so many false breakouts especially in a sideways or downtrending market.

However, a high conviction breakout is one that happens on big volume – in a bad market, the stock may give you enough time to get out before hitting your stop loss; in a good market, the stock will likely rocket.

Big volume at the crucial breakout level will occur when strong demand meets a lack of supply, causing the price to pop up significantly.

So if you’re trading breakouts and you’re constantly getting stopped out, then consider ONLY trading breakouts that occur on high RVOL (combine this with an uptrending market and you WR will probably increase).

# 2. Trading Catalysts

One of my main and favourite setups is catalyst based gap ups, otherwise known as Episodic Pivots, Gap and Go, and other names.

If a stock gaps up over major resistance levels on huge RVOL, then you better put it on your watchlist for a potential entry – how you enter and manage the trade is another story which I’ll cover another time.

For me, the two major factors that determine whether I enter the trade or not is:

(a) A significant catalyst such as earnings.

(b) A high RVOL that’s at least 4x or 400% of its usual traded volume.

If the play doesn’t meet both of these factors, then I’m passing on it.

Of course, it doesn’t mean that the trade will work out; even if all the stars were aligned, your trade can still go against you – that’s why we adhere to risk management.

\--------------------------------------------

So, if you’re not using both the Volume and Relative Volume indicators, start using it now and see how your trading improves.

Background : I lost my job in February. Early 60s so I figured, rather than go back to the labor market, I'd transition to trading full time. And when people asked what I was going to do, I said. 

I started during covid, like many, so had been through the learning curve. But this year was, obviously, more intense and I'm finally pulling ahead in the black. 

So this friend, who is normally a wonderful person, a few weeks ago dropped a text bomb that they want me to come over to their house and help them pick a few stocks. Later I them I told them I couldn't, for the same reason I wouldn't tell them how to spend their money in any other situation, and they dropped it. 

Now, they're asking again. I just said to look at data.

1kdsndj,2025-05-03,2025-05-03 09:12:12,I lost my $100K funded account — need real advice to rebuild and grow,"Hey everyone,

Two days ago, I lost my $100K funded trading account. It’s been a tough pill to swallow, but I want to share my story honestly and ask for real advice from those who’ve been through the grind.

# How it all started:

I began trading around six months ago. Started with $5K, made some profits, and used that to buy a $10K prop account. Passed it, then moved on to a $100K account.

To be completely transparent — I know I passed the $5K and $10K phases mostly due to luck and some good signals. But when I got to the $100K account, I was serious. I genuinely wanted to make it work.

# What went wrong:

In the early stages, I was doing well — slowly growing, staying disciplined. But then a family issue came up, and my consistency fell apart. I hit breakeven, and that’s when the downward spiral began. One bad day turned into panic. Eventually, I blew the account.

# Some hard truths I’ve realized:

1. **I don’t have a proper strategy** — but I know deep down I’m ready to learn one that works. I’m ready to give it everything. Time, energy, effort — whatever it takes.
2. **I thought my psychology was strong**, but there are cracks — especially when facing losses beyond my expected risk. I want to fix this.
3. **Risk management is the only thing that kept me afloat** for 4 months. That’s the one pillar I’ve held onto.

Right now, I have just **$27 left in that account**, and I know realistically it’s not enough to recover $7K. So I’m planning to go back to the basics — maybe start again with $5K, and rebuild step-by-step.

# What I’m asking for:

I’m here because I truly want to master this field from the ground up. If you have a strategy that gives solid RR and long-term consistency, I’m ready to learn. I’m not looking for shortcuts anymore.

Please share your insights, tips, or anything you wish you knew when you were starting out. I’ll appreciate every bit of guidance.

I’m fully committed to forging myself into a consistently profitable trader. Not just for money — but for the mastery of the game.

Thanks in advance for reading and helping. 🙏",113,263,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1kdsndj/i_lost_my_100k_funded_account_need_real_advice_to/,year,Advice,0.9
1lj8ubg,2025-06-24,2025-06-24 07:41:07,Leaving trading until I become disciplined,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been in the markets for the past 3–4 years. I’ve made some profits, I’ve taken some losses — thousands of hours spent watching charts, backtesting, learning ICT concepts, journaling, tweaking strategies… you name it.

Over the last year, I’ve been trading a system with a 50% win rate and a risk-reward of 1:2 to 1:4. It’s a solid strategy, and when I followed it, I was breakeven at worst and profitable at best. But the problem wasn’t the markets — it was me.

My psychology got in the way. Greed. FOMO. Impatience. Overtrading. But most of all, a lack of discipline.

And if I’m being honest, that lack of discipline doesn’t just show up in my trading — it’s everywhere in my life. I try to wake up early… and fail the next day. I say I’ll stop watching porn… relapse. Plan to exercise… never stay consistent. Go to bed at 11… doomscroll until 3am. And then the cycle repeats.

How can I expect to be a disciplined trader when I’m not even a disciplined person?

So I’ve made a decision:
I’m stepping away from trading completely for the next year.

No charts. No backtesting. No trade recaps. Nothing.

I’m going to take that time to rebuild myself — my habits, my mindset, my health, my self-control. I want to come back not just as a better trader, but as a better person overall.

Wishing all of you the best in your own journeys. I’ll be back — but only when I’ve earned the right to be.

We’ve all heard it: *“90% of traders fail.”* It’s one of the most quoted statistics in trading circles. But have you ever actually stopped to ask: *why* is that the case?

I’ve always had an issue with how this statistic is presented - not because it’s untrue, but because it’s misleading without context.

Let me give you an example.

Say a popular YouTube trading video goes viral. 100 people watch it. Motivated and hyped up, maybe 40 of them open a brokerage account the same week. Out of those, most have no background in finance, no strategy, no idea what risk management even means. They start trading with real money anyway.

Meanwhile, also on that same platform, are a handful of traders with 3, 5, even 10 years of experience. They've built systems, tested strategies, blown up accounts, learned risk control, and stayed in the game.

A year later, 36 of those 40 beginners are gone - accounts blown or abandoned. 4 are still active, but struggling. Only 1 might have found a way to be consistently profitable. The others - the veterans - are still there, still compounding, still refining their edge.

Now let’s run the stats: 100% traders started that year. 10% are still profitable. 90% failed. Voilà - there’s your 90%/10% split.

But what does that really reflect? Is it a condemnation of trading as a profession? Or just a consequence of mass participation without preparation?

**This is the real issue**: trading has **no barriers to entry.** Anyone can click a few buttons and be in the market within hours — no license, no qualification, no knowledge required. That’s what makes it beautiful, and dangerous.

So the “90% fail” stat doesn’t reflect the nature of trading. It reflects human behavior - overconfidence, lack of discipline, emotional reactions, FOMO, revenge trading - and how unprepared most people are when they start.

If trading outcomes were random, we’d expect a 50/50 split over time. The fact that it skews so heavily toward failure tells you people are actively making choices that lead to losses.

So don’t fear the 90% - understand it. The failure rate isn’t a prophecy. It’s a filter. If you commit to mastering the craft, you’re already doing what most never even attempt.

P.S. I used 90% for reference, but the range is usually given among 85-98%, however, it doesn't change the message.",107,64,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1kjm51a/90_of_traders_fail_but_the_statistics_dont_tell/,year,Discussion,0.91

1. Poor back support
2. Ignoring orange juice futures

I upgraded to a chair with proper lumbar support and my trading improved instantly. I stopped panic selling. My breathing stabilized. I held through earnings. Coincidence?

Now, let’s talk about the real market mover: orange juice futures. Quiet. Underappreciated. But a better volatility indicator than VIX and a better hedge than gold. Ask yourself - when’s the last time you checked the OJ chart before placing a trade? Never? That’s why you’re down.

How about exit? What does let profit run? If you your trade is in 100$ profit, then suddenly it pulls back 50-60%, then this does not mean you letting profit run, lol, you just lost fucking 50%. The idea is to maximize profit in the shortest time possible.

I know most of you are likely trading a $50K prop account, and thinking you can trade 5 Mini's and keep blowing accounts.  
On those 50K funded accounts, you should be trading 2-3 MICROS MAX.  
You should be able to take 10 losses in a row and have it not blow you up. Give your strategy time to work for you, it can't work for you if 3 losses means you're account is done. Place those stop losses as wide as they should be, which won't scare you if you are sized properly.

You then don't size up after you have made $1,000. You need to EARN sizing up, by proving at least 6 months of profitability and building a cushion to again be at a spot where 7-10 losses in a row doesn't blow your account up.

This helped me a lot, it's not sexy, its SLOW progress, but it's what you need to do. Size down, be happy with +$200 days and stick to your rules.

Another thing that helped me big time is using stop entries.   
You want to long? okay set a buy stop above a candle or wherever you see fit to get tapped in. This keeps me out of SOOO many failed trades.

1ngw28u,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 12:40:40,Why does it take many years to become profitable with trading?,"Hi traders. Im still quite new to trading (trading for only 6 months now). And before i get into this question, I am not claiming to be profitable or nearly there yet, I just wanna know what it takes.

Why does it take most people 3+ years to be profitable when trading is said to be better when it is simplified? In my eyes, the main things you need to be successful are: 

\- A strategy that has been extensively backtested that is proven to work

\- Good risk management

\- The psychological aspect of trading where you objectively follows the rules of your trading plan and not let your emotions impact how you execute and manage trades.

The way i see it: finding a working strategy with good risk management shouldnt take too long if you have enough time. A strategy can be backtested over 12 months within 2 days of being on fxreplay. so theoretically if you have time to you could backtest around 10 strategy variations a month. Forward testing can happen as time goes by.

I understand for some the psychology aspect may take a while to master, but lets say that someone has little emotional decision making from the start and has a vast understanding that trading involves losing as well, you just need a good RR, even though your win rate is less than 50%.

  
Taking into account all the above, I dont see why it cant take someone about a year to become profitable?

am I missing something important? it just doesnt seem that complicated to me.",102,185,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ngw28u/why_does_it_take_many_years_to_become_profitable/,year,Discussion,0.89

I am not responsible for the strategy's performance in the future or in your case, nor do I guarantee its profitability on your instruments. Any decisions you make are entirely at your own risk*

This is my first post about strategies, so this time we will consider the simplest strategy.

# Idea

[RSI ](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/relative-strength-index)is the most popular and effective indicator.

* **Trend filter** (RSI> 50.0 is uptrend)
* **The pullbacks indicator** (if the trend is strong and RSI is low, then the price has probably already completed the pullback)

This well-known strategy uses the RSI(2) with the smallest possible period to enter trade during a price pullback. This generates more entry points, and therefore more trades, more profits.

You can experiment with parameters as much as you like, almost any set of parameters yields profits, so it’s easy to build a portfolio.

# Strategy

* **Instrument**: US100 Index (Or NQ)
* **TF**: 1D (*The strategy does not work on time frames below.)*
* **Initial Capital:** 10k$
* **Risked Money**: 500$
* **Data Period**: 2012.01.19 - 2024.11.28

*The strategy buys only if there are no open trades. That is, there can be only 1 trade at a time.*  
*The strategy does not have a shortsell trades as instrument is often in the uptrend*

***Inputs:***

1. Period - **2**/3/4
2. Low - 10/15/**25**/35
3. High - 90/85/**75**/65

**Buy Rule:** RSI(Period) < Low  
*You can add a trend filter. This will reduce the number of trends, but protect against bad periods of strategy*

**Close Rule**: RSI(Period) > High. Exit on friday. Exit after 30 days.  
*You can experiment with the close rule: select another indicator, period, a certain price level, day or just close at the first successful closing of the price (close of candlestick > buy price)*

Since it is a [Mean Reversion](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/mean-reversion) strategy:  
**I do not recommend using the Stop Loss** option as it increases the drawdown and reduces the profit.  
**I don’t recommend using Take Profit** as it reduces profits.

# Conclusions

1. The strategy has clearly bad periods during the downtrend. Some years have been unsuccessful because of this.
2. On the other hand, almost every year of successful trades more than 80%.
3. An average of 20 trades per year, which is about 2 each month.
4. As I close deals on Friday, Friday is the worst day.
5. The average length of a trade is 5.5
6. Monte Carlo failed, probably because of the mean reliable type of strategy

1mrc4om,2025-08-15,2025-08-15 18:12:28,Trading isn't about mastering your emotions.,"
I've been following this subreddit for awhile now and seems like every week I see some post talking about how trading is all about mastering your emotions.

If you are feeling all sorts of emotions while trading it's your mind reacting to the fact that you don't know what your are doing. You haven't done the work. You haven't put in the time. Your emotions are the symptom not the problem.

Feeling fomo and the urge to chase an extended stock?
That's just a misunderstanding of risk to reward. An extended stock isn't tempting to me because the risk to reward is terrible and nothing about that chart entices me. The reason I don't chase is because the chart looks like shit, not because I've meditated and mastered my emotions. My emotion in that moment is aligned with my system. I feel the setup sucks and I move on.

Feeling greedy and want to extend your profit target? Did you ever actually back test your system against your setups?
I know most of my trades don't go past 3ATR , I don't feel any emotion or random urge to move my target. I know my target is good because I've spent hundreds of hours building a backtester and testing different ideas across 5 years of setups. I don't feel anything. I just put in my order and move on.

Trading is a skill and the more skilled you get the more your emotions will align with your trading naturally. The need to repress or fight urges that go against your strategy will go away.

If you break your sell rules due to emotion rather then sitting around telling yourself to be mentally stronger, do some actual work. Study your sell rules, backtest them, backtest other variants.",100,66,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1mrc4om/trading_isnt_about_mastering_your_emotions/,year,Discussion,0.89

1. Built a real routine Same wake-up, same prep, same shutdown. Once I started treating trading like a job instead of a gamble, things started to click.
2. Started journaling everything Not just the trades, but why I took them, how I felt, and what rules I broke (or followed). I use tradezella to track everything, and it’s helped me catch patterns I wasn’t seeing before.
3. Stopped trading what I didn't plan. If I didn’t plan the setup before the session started, I wouldn't take trades. helped me avoid forcing anything.
4. Redefined what a “win” means If I followed my rules all day, even with no trades, that’s a win. If I made money but broke my rules, it’s not. Shifting how I measure success changed everything.
5. Focused on execution over PnL. I stopped caring about the daily dollar amount and started grading myself on how well I followed my plan.
6. Review every week with honesty Once a week, I go through my trades, my mindset, and the decisions I made, not just the outcomes. It keeps me accountable and focused on improvement.

1m0tdc3,2025-07-15,2025-07-15 16:48:41,What is ATR and Why I love Using It,"Years ago, I used to get so frustrated testing my strategies because of what I call the *freeze effect*. If you’ve been trading for any amount of time, I’m willing to bet you know exactly what I mean.

Your setup appears. All the boxes are checked. But now you're stuck — trying to calculate position size. By the time you’ve figured it out, the move’s already gone.

That’s when I discovered the **Average True Range (ATR)**.

ATR does exactly what it sounds like: it measures the **average true range** of a stock — a clean, effective proxy for volatility.

Let me give you two extremes:

* **$AXON** has an ATR of **29.75**
* **$SPY** has an ATR of **4.49**

Both trade at similar price levels, but AXON is about **6x more volatile**. That matters.

Why? Because a volatile stock needs **room to breathe**.

Let’s say you use a $10 stop loss. That might work fine on SPY, but on AXON, it’ll likely get hit quickly — not because your setup was wrong, but because the stop didn’t match the volatility. So even if you’re risking the same 1% on a $100K account, **you’d get stopped out \~6x faster** on AXON, on average.

But here’s where it gets interesting:  
If I size my stop **based on ATR** — let’s say **1.5x ATR** — I give my trade room to work **regardless of the ticker**. Now, all I need to figure out is how many shares to buy.

Here’s the formula I use:

    Shares = (Account Size × Risk %) / (ATR × Multiplier)

Example:  
You have a $100K account, willing to risk 1% ($1,000), and XYZ has an ATR of $10.

If you use a 1.5x ATR stop:

    Shares = 1,000 / (1.5 × 10) = 1,000 / 15 ≈ 66 shares

You’d buy 66 shares and set a $15 stop loss. Now the position is tuned to the stock’s volatility.

I personally use **ThinkorSwim**, and I’ve coded a simple script that adds a label on my charts showing me the exact share count to buy. No more freezing. No more second-guessing.

I’m completely new to trading, but I’m serious about learning it the right way from day one. My goal is to build strong fundamentals, discipline, and a sustainable trading routine so I can eventually trade profitably and independently. I’m not looking for “get-rich-quick” tips — I want to treat this like a skill and profession.

Here’s what I’m looking for guidance on:

1. Where to start as a complete beginner:
	•	Should I begin with Forex, Stocks, Crypto, or something else?
	•	How to choose a broker/platform as a beginner?
	•	How much capital should I realistically start with for learning?

2. Lifestyle & mindset changes:
	•	Daily habits or routines that help traders stay disciplined and focused
	•	Managing emotions, avoiding revenge trading, and dealing with losses
	•	Time management for someone who can dedicate 1–2 hours/day on weekdays and more on weekends

3. Learning resources:
	•	Best beginner-friendly books that actually helped you
	•	YouTube channels, websites, or courses worth following
	•	Practice methods (e.g., demo trading, backtesting, paper trading)

4. Skills to focus on first:
	•	Price action vs indicators — which to learn first?
	•	Risk management strategies that work in real life
	•	How to build and stick to a trading plan

5. Common beginner mistakes:
	•	What traps should I avoid early on?
	•	Things you wish you knew when starting out

Extra context:
I’m ready to commit to a daily routine and make lifestyle changes if needed. I’m more interested in long-term consistent profits rather than quick wins.

1mc3tfg,2025-07-29,2025-07-29 02:08:56,How do you actually learn trading? Guide to those who are looking into trading.,"Hi, 

I’m a pro trader who have been in this business for 7+ years and over the years I have seen many traders come and go and many become profitable and many more amount huge losses and wreck their lives. 

I’m here to share some tips of how to go about trading so it can work for you. 

- start trading with 0 capital the first 2 years, strictly. No matter how intuitive and easy it feels, trust me you are going to lose your capital no matter what. Trading requires you to know the market so well that even if you miss a single factor you will lose money in the market and even when you know everything to be profitable, you will still have market losses. 

- learn from books, PDFs, YouTube videos. Stay away from indicators as they make you a lazy analyst, study price action and key levels from traders online who share them on YouTube. (Stay away from ICT as well). This is a lot of fun. If you’re curious by nature, there is so much information you come across (but it helps to have a bu*****t meter) as many traders chat nonsense. Even the so called experts. No one is an expert when it comes to the market, not even someone like Jesse Livermore, market is always your best teacher. 

- pick a mentor who has a good understanding of the market, someone who has taught traders before and can guide you to become profitable. This will cost you a few upfront but you have a good guidance and much easier to learn as you also gain the mentor’s trading experience of do’s and dont’s which you can avoid. Saves time and trading money (in huge losses) but costs tuition. The whole experience of learning how to analyse and trade becomes comfortable when you’re lucky to choose the right mentor for you. Comfortable in the sense, s/he guides you when you make mistakes in analysis, when your thought process is wrong as you take trades, your blind spots can be seen, psychological help, and so on. Again, this is only an option. A good one at that. 

Regardless of what you do, DO NOT risk money until you have at least 1 profitable month in technical analysis or fundamental analysis - and every trade is “analysed” and not just entered without analysing. I can’t stress this enough - anyone can make money in the market as it’s just a simple buy or sell but staying consistent requires skill. 

Trading income is directly correlated to your skill. It’s a skill based income and not otherwise. Until you become highly skilled in this business you can never ever stay profitable. Do not listen to anyone, not your brokers, not the internet, not your friends or family members, trust that - trading is highly risky (especially if you have a gambling mindset) and you will lose all your savings if you do not invest into learning it as a skill. And as every skill it takes years to obtain - to learn what happens in the market would only take you 1-3 months (if you learn the right stuff) but as any skill goes - it’s experience that will make you money, and that requires years of experience in market. You get different types of market behaviour over the years and that teaches you a lot more than anyone can. 

Again, trading will take you minimum 3 years. If you have psychological issues it will 100% take you longer. Sometimes even 5-6 years. This is the truth. I hope this helps all. Know what you’re getting into and don’t risk your rent money. 

Thanks!

1lij0kg,2025-06-23,2025-06-23 11:06:41,The stuff that actually made me a consistent trader,"Everyone’s always talking about indicators, secret setups, or the newest “holy grail” strategy.

But honestly, none of that helped me get consistent.

Here’s what *actually* made a difference for me:

**1. Consistency > Strategy**

You can have a profitable strategy with a 70% win rate, but if you only stick to it half the time, it doesn’t matter. You’re just winging it at that point.

What helped me: I made a super simple checklist for entries, exits, and risk. If a trade didn’t check every box, I passed on it. No exceptions.

**2. Journaling Changed the Game**

At first I thought journaling was overrated. Now it’s probably the most valuable thing I do.

It keeps me honest and gives me actual data to improve. I log:

* Why I took the trade
* How I felt before/during/after
* What the market looked like
* What I’d change next time

After 30–50 trades, patterns really start to show themselves.

**3. Risk Management Isn’t Just a % Rule**

It’s more than “don’t risk more than 2%.” Real risk management is knowing how hot your account is running, adjusting to volatility, and not letting one trade wreck your week.

Now I have daily loss caps and I reduce size after a drawdown. It keeps me in the game.

**4. Focus on the Process, Not the P&L**

Every time I get too fixated on profits, I overtrade or second guess myself.

Now I track how well I followed my plan. I can’t control outcomes, but I *can* control execution.

A clean loss doesn’t bother me anymore. A sloppy win does.

**5. Stick to One Setup at First**

Trying to trade everything (breakouts, reversals, different products, etc.) had me all over the place.

I got consistent once I picked *one* product, *one* time frame, and *one* setup, and just drilled it. Simpler = better.

**6. Track the Right Stuff**

I started tracking more than just wins/losses:

* Win %
* Avg win vs avg loss
* Time of day I do best/worst
* How often I break rules

That’s the kind of stuff that actually gives you direction and helps scale up.

**7. Psychology Is the Final Boss**

Impulse trades, revenge trades, hesitation... it’s all in your head.

It’s not about “having more discipline” it’s about setting up systems so you don’t need to constantly rely on willpower.

I started:

* Limiting screen time
* Planning every session in advance
* Using hard loss limits
* Focusing on process wins, not just money

At the end of the day, the real edge isn’t some secret indicator.

It’s having a clear process, sticking to it, learning from your data, and not letting your brain sabotage you.",88,36,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1lij0kg/the_stuff_that_actually_made_me_a_consistent/,year,Advice,0.94

Let me help you.,"If you're reading this post because you're in desperate need of help trying to recover extreme financial loss from trading. You've come to the right place, as I know the exact strategy that will help you recover your funds, prevent further losses, and make some serious profit. It's a very simple step-by-step method. I call it ""The Mattegy Strategy"" named after me, Matt.

It goes like this:

Step 1. Get a job you idiot. 

Step 2. Maintain budgeting spreadsheets and put money away in savings.

Step 3. Stop gambling: 

You call it trading, but what you're doing is gambling. Traders use risk management and analysis to minimize losses and maximise gains. Guess what, you did neither and you lost thousands of dollars because you're a gambler. Trading is not a machine where you throw $25,000 at and you become a millionaire overnight you dummy. Seek professional help if you need to.

Step 4. Read a book:  
  
Honestly, if you're stupid enough to throw $25k that you can't afford to lose at something you don't understand and don't know what to do when you've lost all that money, you're all kinds of stupid.   
Think about it, that's the price of a decent car, you're literally as stupid as somebody who doesn't know anything about operating a car, road rules or safety, buying a car and then driving it into the most hectic traffic.  
You need an education. So read some books you idiot, then you'll gain intelligence to prevent further stupidity from occuring.

1k7hj6x,2025-04-25,2025-04-25 06:23:28,Jim Simons: The Mathematician Who Quietly Beat the Markets,"**Today**, April 25, would have been **Jim Simons’ 87th birthday**. Y'all probably already know him. But, for those who don't...

Simons, also known as the Quant King, was not a typical investor. He was a mathematician who founded the quant fund Renaissance Technologies, the firm behind the Medallion Fund. Over 30 years, Medallion delivered around **66 percent annual returns before fees** and **39 percent after fees**!

[Image credits to simonsfoundation.org](https://preview.redd.it/2d1xfx70jywe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d9f33eeaa02ea9aff2ef697c615e18ea5f5b3e0)

Many academics promote the efficient market hypothesis - the idea that markets reflect all available information and cannot be consistently outperformed. Simons and his team showed that this is not entirely true.

They used **statistics, computing and historical data** to find patterns in market behavior. These patterns had little to do with news and nothing to do with gut instinct, instead their approach focused on quantitative research, model building, and rigorous testing. Their main advantage came from the depth of their research, not from plain automation or high-speed trading.

Eventually, the fund became **so profitable they stopped taking outside capital** and ran it only for employees. Simons rarely spoke about his work, and Renaissance kept its methods private. But his results spoke for themselves. He went on to donate a significant portion of his wealth to **charitable causes, including education and mathematics research**.

\----

Happy birthday to Jim Simons, the man who brought science and quant techniques into finance and quietly transformed the way markets are understood. His team single handedly debunked the EMH, and showed that with the right tools, structure can be found beneath the randomness and noise.

Here is how he summarized his life: 

*""I did a lot of math. I made a lot of money, and I gave almost all of it away. That's the story of my life.""*

1kb52vj,2025-04-29,2025-04-29 21:50:34,One Thing I Wish I Knew Before I Started Trading,"Hello Traders**,** 

Polished by yours truly Chat GPT:) anyway

I’ve been trading pretty seriously for the past 3–4 months, and I’ve learned a tremendous amount—about both the markets and myself. Sometimes I think back and wonder why it took me so long to figure this out. I’m hoping that others who are trading can see this for themselves too.

When I first started learning about trading, I jumped from one idea to another, constantly searching for the “answer.” I spent months reading and consuming content but wasn’t really getting anywhere. In fact, most of it just ended up contradicting how I think about trading.

Maybe this doesn’t apply as much if you’re an algo or purely systematic trader, but I genuinely wish I had spent less time reading and more time actually trading. And no—I’m not talking about endless paper trading either. I mean putting real skin in the game, even without a perfect edge. You need to place trades. You need to feel what it’s like to win and lose. You need to experience slippage, bid-ask spread, and the emotions that come with it.

Yes, you’ll probably lose a good chunk—if not all—of your money at first. But that risk can be dramatically reduced with solid risk management. The time you spend *in* the market builds real experience and discretion, which is something no “TJR order block” strategy can teach you.

Once you’ve built that base of live experience, *then* you’ll start to understand how and when to implement different strategies you read about.

One thing that still baffles me: why is every social media trader pushing systematic rules like “when this happens, do this every time”? Unless you’re a coding wizard or a math genius, discretion will be your best friend in this game.

Anyway, just a bit of a rant. I’m still relatively new myself, but I’ve spent a year or two reading and getting nowhere—until I actually started trading. I’m not saying to go dump your money into a broker account and YOLO it. But at the very least, come in with some basic risk management and get in the arena.

Hope this helps a newer trader out there and leave your thoughts experienced traders.",88,41,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1kb52vj/one_thing_i_wish_i_knew_before_i_started_trading/,year,Discussion,0.92

Basically what the title says. Mine was earlier this week with Scholar Rock Holding Corp (SRRK).

I bought about $2K worth of shares earlier this year in July at $7.63/share and they surged over 300% yesterday to $34.94.

Definitely did NOT expect something like this to happen considering their price has stayed relatively within $1-2 from when I bought in.

I sold my shares when I saw the jump. Pretty wild to see a stock go from barely moving to quadrupling overnight.

Looks like it was due to some trial results, but I didn’t really dig into it. Was more focused on whether to sell or not.

	•	Have you managed to stay consistently profitable while keeping a job?

1mm8mx6,2025-08-09,2025-08-09 23:50:10,Sharing my personal story as an unintentional 9:30 - 4:00 trader,"**Edit:** I've gotta laugh. For some humans, they've totally lost the ability to discern between AI and human. And there is nothing I can do over the internet to prove otherwise. Never thought I'd be the one having to subject myself to the Turing Test. Hilarious, if you ask me.

I browse Reddit to fill the lonely void that comes with being a trader. Part of the impetus for posting this is because of AI fatigue. It feels like every other post on Reddit is AI drivel, so this post is my small way of protesting.

Origin story: I lost my uncle, best friend from high school (fuck cancer), and another close friend from college (seriously, fuck cancer) all in 2 months. I also lost my job during this period as deep depression set in. This marks the beginning of how I became an unintentional trader.

As I said, I'm an unintentional trader as trading wasn't anywhere on my radar. But I had to put food on the table, and how hard could it be? Sometimes, not knowing what you're getting yourself into is a superpower. So I dove in head first.

The first month, I made $40K.  I thought I had figured something out (as did my wife). Then I lost $15K in a day. Then $8K the next. I felt the blood draining from my face and I stared at the screen for a good while trying to process it all.

Not so much because I lost money (yeah, this part sucked), but because if I couldn't figure out how to extract money from the market, then I'd have to find a job and the job market felt hopeless and has been frozen solid in my industry.

Every day for a year was like drinking out of a firehose. No exaggeration, I put in a minimum 12 hour days, including weekends trying to get better. I wouldn't have imagined the words like kurtosis, leptokurtic, skewness, etc becoming part of my vernacular, and I started interpreting everything through the lens of trading. I also meditate, so it often becomes philosophical as I like drawing analogies between the two:  e.g., everything in life is a trade, if you're not struggling then you're not improving, etc (identical to meditation).

After about half a year, the mind fog gradually started lifting. I understood the lingo, and what was once hard to understand became easy and second nature. But I still wasn't making money, and I realized that my initial performance was pure luck (flip a coin 10 times and you can get heads 10x in a row).

I backtested to ad nauseam. But I still lost money. I remember waking up in the middle of the night in panic, because I kept losing money and I couldn't stop worrying about my wife and 2 young kids. Every time I'd look at my kids, even in photos, I felt that I was failing as a father not being able to financially support them. It hurts to think about it even now.

I spent the next 3 months iterating daily, improving some aspect, no matter how small. Key thing for my strategy was reducing execution risk, so I iterated on that until I could get my backtests to match my actual trades as closely as possible.

Behavioral risk lurked in the background, because I didn't know if I could stick to my rules (that I came up with after countless backtests). But backtests being historical and not indicative of future performance, I often thought I knew better and deviated from the plan. Even when I made money, it felt kind of icky. And when I lost money, it felt worse. And because I interfered, it messed up the statistics.

On the 4th month, I made $1500. I am prouder of this $1500 than the initial $40000 I made, because I followed all my rules. Because I knew it's repeatable, and I knew that if this edge erodes, I am capable of putting in the work to figure out another way to extract money from the market.

I've been able to do this full time. Trading is like hunting. You eat what you kill, and some days you go hungry. Remember, you need to learn to survive to hunt another day.

But how could humans possibly do that better than AI? Especially when AI is insanely good at analyzing massive amounts of data and making predictions.

Chart data seems like the exact kind of thing AI should be amazing at. It’s clean, it doesn’t need much memory, and it’s just candle patterns. Open, close, high, low. It should be able to do what we do, except with the full memory of every market move ever.",84,125,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1khopv6/how_hasnt_ai_taken_over_trading_yet/,year,Discussion,0.85

1ndz3iy,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 00:03:29,8 years in the stuff that finally made me consistent,"


I’m not a guru and I’m not rich. I’m a trader who started with options, moved to futures, blew more accounts than I want to admit, and only got truly consistent in the last couple of years. If you’re early in the journey, learn from my mistakes so you can skip some of the pain.

the mnemonic that kept me honest: stay calm

Eight principles that actually changed my results.

S - size small until you’re consistent My best decision wasn’t a new indicator. It was cutting size to the point where losses were annoying, not identity-shaking. Small risk made it possible to execute the plan after a loss instead of spiraling.

T - track everything Your memory lies. The journal doesn’t. Once I logged entries, exits, reason for entry, screenshots, emotional state, and R multiple, patterns jumped out. Premature exits. Revenge trades. Friday slippage. All invisible until it was on paper, I cold see everything crystal clear, even the dumbest things that were right infront of me all along, for exaple: I had a 10% winrate trading London session :/. Journaling in tradezella made this process easier because I could actually see the data that my emotions wanted to ignore.

A - accept losses fast A setup can be A+ and still fail. What matters is whether you respect the invalidation. If price tags your line and says you’re wrong, you’re done. Taking the cut early is cheaper than negotiating with the market.

Y - yield to context The same setup behaves differently in trend vs chop, open vs lunch, high-vol vs dead tape. I keep two playbooks now: trend and range. If context doesn’t match the playbook, I don’t force it.

C - commit to one model My breakthrough came from mastering one entry model and one management style. Backtested it hundreds of times. Forward tested it. Now I know exactly what I’m waiting for and what disqualifies it.

A - audit your ego Ego shows up as adding recklessly, holding losers because “it has to bounce,” or scaling too fast after a streak. When I made rules that specifically target ego, my equity curve smoothed out.

L - level to level execution Plan the levels, define risk, set targets, and let the trade work. If I move a stop or take profit outside the plan, I write down why. Most times the why is fear or greed. That awareness fixed more P&L than any new tool.

M - make routines your edge Pre-market checklist. Session guardrails. Post-market review. Rinse and repeat. When routines got boring, results got better. The structure I built in my journal turned trading into a repeatable process instead of a coin flip.

Most traders don’t fail because the market is rigged, or because they couldn’t find the “right” strategy. They fail because they never learned how to regulate themselves. Discipline, emotional control, and sticking to rules sound simple until real money is on the line.



It’s not a strategy problem. It’s a behavior problem.



If you can’t follow your own rules, no system will save you. That’s why the traders who succeed often sound repetitive, they’re obsessively doing the basics over and over while everyone else is chasing edge after edge.

Despite practically every resource on the internet (let alone this sub) saying:

* Don't risk more than 1% of capital on any given trade.
* Trading is a business, you need to journal, keep spreadsheets, and do research.
* Backtest your strategies.

I see many post about losing all their money because they fail to follow simple and common-sense instructions. How is it not common sense that if you put $20k into something that you don't understand, that you are making a bad decision - That's the price of a small car, who in their right mind would buy a 20k car and drive it if they don't know the first thing about driving?

It may seem like I'm just complaining, and I kind of am - because I don't want to see people doing this to themselves.   
  
It also seems like a lot of the advice for newbies on this sub is just personal preferences and opinions being thrown around without any regard for the fundamentals. There are so many threads by newbies saying ""how do I \_\_\_\_\_\_?"" and then the thread is overrun by 100 guys saying different superficial things instead of focusing on the very few basic and foundational practices needed to progress and succeed.

1nklchw,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 17:44:20,From Nothing to Profitable: My Grounded Approach to Trading Strategy Design,"Look, most active traders don’t fail because they’re lazy - they fail because they overfit, build strategies backwards &/or never collect enough data.

I’ve been there - chasing systems and setups that didn’t make logical sense or didn’t fit my schedule.

Eventually I stopped following bs noise and started building from nothing the way systems should be built.

I'm going to try to break this down step by step - not just the rules, but how I’d think if I were starting from next to zero trading experience. Regardless if you are Mechanical or Discretionary this guide is designed to help you find your edge.

Let’s say I’ve just decided to become a trader. I know nothing. I just have the will. Here’s what I’d do. For those who’ve seen **Version 1 (Now deleted) search \[4\] to see key changes. Thank you!**

**Citations are visible at the bottom for context if desired**

# #1 I'd feel and adjust to my constraints first

**You start with what is possible for you, personally. That immediately rules out half the noise.**

* Time of day you can realistically trade (not **idealized** \- **realistically**)
* Knowing in advance if you need to sleep or work through certain sessions & what that means for your trading execution
* Do you want to hold trades overnight or not & is it compatible with your system (yes or no, on a strategy-by-strategy basis)
* How much capital will you trade with (eventually)?

**Why? Because all rule-building happens within constraints.**  
If you work a day job and trade 5m charts, you’re probably not able to trade the New York session. If you only trade during London session, you don’t build rules around Asian session. It really depends on time zones and other factors. Higher timeframes like hourly allow for higher versatility.

Ignoring constraints is why a lot of retail traders go nowhere – they copy others without aligning their system with their actual life. If you're ""trading here and there""/""when I can trade, I do X,"" it's adding noise to your results. The more variance in consistency, the worse it is for your bottom line.

# Pick One Market & Timeframe

**You don’t experiment with everything. Pick one instrument and one timeframe.**

For example: Dow Jones, hourly chart

**Why? Because markets behave differently.** Trying to make a system that works on Nasdaq, Gold, EURUSD, and Dow Jones at once is usually unwise. You will overfit or your strategy will break.

**One market. One behaviour set/trade setup.** If you want to run multiple instruments or setups/systems, split the risk amongst them. Each one should be good enough to isolate the risk and perform on its own.

**You must understand how your chosen market behaves. \[3\] & \[5\]**  
**Mean reverting, Alternating/Near Random Walk or Trending**

**Examples**  
Mean reverting: Dow Jones/YM, EURUSD  
Alternating/Near Random Walk: S&P 500/ES  
Trending: Nasdaq/NQ

You can do research to know which is which but if you want in-depth you can ask AI to use Hurst Exponent & Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test over market data.

Or if you're into programming you can get python script to do it. ADF Visuals + Hurst Exponential Chart Example

# Start Building with Logic, Not Results

To clarify, when you're learning, it's okay to look at charts for a while to familiarise yourself with how they look and what the candlesticks show.

The key is to avoid falling into the trap of confirmation bias. **You should write down an idea first, then test it.** **Do not change your rules as you go along.** And most importantly!

**Never go searching through charts to find ideas to test.**

**Start at the drawing board not the candlesticks.**  
Forget indicators. Forget entries. First you need structure. Here's what to make rules about:

**1. Trade Time Window**  
Define which hours are “valid” for entering trades, based on when your chosen market has high volume.  
**Example:** 8am to 4pm NY time for US indices.

**Why?** Because you need volatility to reach targets & volume at your entries for price to trend in your favour regardless of your system style (reversals, mean reversion or trend trading).

**Ex. Rule:**  
“I only take trades between 3pm and 9pm UK time.”

You can mark this with a sessions indicator (e.g. ""Sessions on Chart"" on TradingView, 10:00 to 16:00 setting).

# Risk Management

**Decide what you’re risking per trade.** Fixed % (e.g., 3% of account).  
In a live environment this value can be based on risk tolerance. It must be a logical value that fits within your goals, limits and needs. Your risk needs to be planned ahead, and stuck to. Your risk can be static or dynamic.

**For prop firms, you must calculate your risk to fall in line with the maximum drawdown rules.**

The Amount risked has to be calculated with maximum drawdown & maximum daily drawdown in heavy consideration.

For example, someone may have a system with a loss equivalent to 10 losses in a row -10R maximum in testing his prop firm allows up to 10% maximum drawdown so he decides to trade 0.6% per trade allowing him to have space for that maximum peak to trough drawdown + 50% extra.

**Dynamic example:**  
More Aggressive traders may opt in for back tested rules to increase risk when holding on profitable running positions ex. Entering another position on another rejection (scaling in) or having pre-defined plans to increase risk during winning or losing periods in live environments depending on their risk tolerance & goals.

**Decide what your target-to-stop-loss ratio is before testing the system and stick with it (e.g., RRR: 2:1, 5:1, etc.).**

Don't adjust this to get better trading performance - **pick it based on logic, not data.**

Ex. Rule: “I aim for 4-5R on all reversal trades"" &/or ""3-4R on continuation trades.”

**If the system doesn't work, I throw it out.**

**Added Annotation for clarity: Find \[1\] At end of doc**

# Entry Style (Define Setup Type)

**Bar Replay backtest only.** Never scroll backward to ‘check’ the setup again.

**Pick something linear and logical.**  
Mean reversion? Reversals? Continuations? Breakouts?

Then ask: **What does that look like?**  
Do I want price to hit a level and reject (reversal)?  
Do I want price to push through and pull back (breakout/continuation)?  
**And why would it work?** What does my setup signify via **order flow mechanics**? **\[5\]**

**Order flow isn’t a system or strategy like educators teach.**  
**It’s the basics of how markets move on a tick-by-tick basis.**

**Basic Example explanation:** 

If there's a buyer at $10,000.25 who wants 100 units, but only 80 are available, price moves up one tick to $10,000.5 to fill the rest.

**Ex. 10000.5 50 available 10000.25 80 available**

He gets **80 filled at 10000.25 and 20 (the rest) at 10000.5**

(10000.25\*(80/100))+(10000.5\*(20/100)) = **10000.3 average**

price fill -> price increased to **10000.5**

# This is liquidity.

The only reason price moves is that there’s an imbalance between buy and sell volume. Nothing else

**That's why markets have a highly random nature. Example at Bonus 2**

Tick = minimum price movement on an instrument.

**Example purposes only: 3-wick reversal**

https://preview.redd.it/vbdtsa8hvzpf1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=810d0b202468627ca8a9a7640688943a260c6d5c

**3 Wick Entry Rule example purposes only:**  
“I place limit orders at the beginning wick of a 2-wick consecutive rejection if it forms and closes during my valid trading hours.”  
3 – Sell Limit Filled, Limit order pulled/expired if no fill on **bar 3**

https://reddit.com/link/1nklchw/video/4tg691xnvzpf1/player

**Short example using Order Flow Mechanics Knowledge \[5\]:**  
A wick high in a candle is rejected by the next candle and it closes. Sellers were present at that wick. Regardless of how the ""Order flow"" had taken place it is **irrefutable**.

If price revisits that price or higher and fails again, closing, I want to sell at that price - expecting a third rejection.

**Sell limit order fill, Bracketed with SL & TP (values known before the close)**

Vice versa for long setups.

**Most people who overcomplicate with “smart money” or “institutional”. Talk are waffling.**

# “If you are using charts to execute, you aren't smart money but you don't have to be dumb money either.”

**Dismiss educator narratives on why their methods supposedly work and use critical thinking applying Order flow mechanic basics to accept or dismiss trading entry ideas.**

Don't sleep walk into the ""institutional"" narrative fallacy’s educators sell you. Think about why price moves on a tick by tick basis and what the candlesticks you're basing your entry off actually indicate.

**Markets aren't ruled by patterns they're ruled by imbalances that's what fuels trends. Without an imbalance price won't move.**

If a setup doesn’t have logic like this backing up why it would succeed enough for it to be profitable besides randomness, you’re wasting your time.

# If your only answer to “why does it work?” is “my backtest says so,” you’re doomed

**I’ve asked a trader why he believes his system works besides his data and silence followed for minutes whilst he tried thinking of what to say. I shown him random OHLC candlesticks with his strategy applied and he thrown in the towel. Don’t be like this.**

https://reddit.com/link/1nklchw/video/t1tvferkvzpf1/player

**Examples of what not to base your system on:**

* Pivot points
* Fibonacci (**Based on faith and crowding**)
* MA bounces (**Random and seen on many data sets** ) Shown on Bonus 2 Fig.
* Complex multi-timeframe analysis (**Hard to quantify and bar replay backtest honestly without hindsight fogging vision**)
* Most **well known** indicators for entries

These methods are 1000% random with weak foundations or are purposefully hard to test accurately and honestly without overfitting. **Educators push it for plausible deniability when systems don’t perform. A model is hard to hold to account if there’s 1000 ways to trade it. The use of Multi time frame analysis in trading is fine as long as it’s not convoluted, has clear rules and is tested properly.**

# Target & Stop Loss Placement

**Targets must be placed consistently.**  
Targets are typically less important than entries and stops – but still important.

If using price structures (e.g. support/resistance), **define the logic first**, then the rules.

Ex. Someone could use swing highs/lows, support/resistance,

clustered wicks or rejection zones. **With fixed rules to define and mark them in advance.**

Price will naturally attract volume at these levels, **even if the instrument's order book volume doesn't reflect it in real time**. Ghost limit orders exist, pending stop orders & order fill algorithm triggers from **countless market participants for different reasons** it doesn't matter what happens when price interacts with these places it's just more often than not that they are **liquid areas**.

**Avoid fixed-distance targets - market volatility is dynamic.**

For example, a ""100 point fixed target"" or a ""20 point fixed stop"" is arbitrary and is not going to work if volatility shifts.

It is better to use dynamic yet consistent targeting methods. A trader must define fixed rules for regarding what is S/R and what is not.

So a dynamic targeting method ex. at defined highs or lows would be that for one trade it is 110 points, the second being 160 points, and the next is 140 points (all placed at predefined levels).

**Fixed targets overfit strategies easily.**

Your **execution costs** must be factored into your system.

Ex. 

If you use a 1:5 RR and a 100-pt target minimum, your minimum stop is 20 pts. 

If your max spread on your CFD is \~2pts, that’s 10% cost per trade - before everything else which matters.

Ex Rule: 

“Target is always ≥100 points for Dow. Stop is one-fifth of target.” - Why? Because it keeps costs at a modest level.

# Instrument-Specific Rules

**Some markets behave uniquely. You don’t need deep stats – just basic experience.**

* Nasdaq trends
* Dow mean reverts
* S&P 500 alternates. (Trending but Near random walk)
* Gold is erratic

Example: If you want mean reversion or early trend entries, Dow is a better choice than Nasdaq.

**Entry Model Influence Example:**  
**Example 1:** If you want mean reversion or early trend entries, Dow is a better choice than Nasdaq. (It’s more probable for Dow reverse intraday)  
**Example 2:** If you want to press trades or let positions run, Nasdaq is a better choice than Dow. (Trends are more pronounced on Nasdaq compared to Dow intraday)  
Either can have a trend or mean reversion model, but different strategies will tend to work better if aligned with the instrument’s nature.

**Strategy Risk Management Setup Influence Examples:**  
**Example 1:** If you have a strategy idea that includes rules to manually trail your stop loss in profit or uses large targets relative to stop size, Nasdaq would likely be a better choice compared to Dow. (Nasdaq trends more intraday which compliments this idea; Dow tends to mean revert/snap back, reducing the potential for home run trades.)  
**Example 2:** If you have a mean reversion strategy idea with a hard take profit and stop loss as risk management (most common), the Dow would likely be a better choice, as its intraday trends are less pronounced compared to the Nasdaq.

 

**Either market can have a trend and/or mean reversion model**, but different entry and risk management strategies will tend to work better if aligned with the instrument’s nature;

# These guidelines are of course not absolutes.

**Trending = Larger price extensions**, **Mean reversion = Higher likelihood of returning to the average price.**

**ADF & Hurst isn’t supposed to be used in real time it’s supposed to be used once to define an instrument and save time testing. Don’t forget that.**

# Start from Blank Charts

Instead of top-down start bottom up.

People look at charts for ideas when you need to **consult logic for inspiration**; **not recency biases from recent price action**. **Added Annotation for clarity: Find \[2\] At end of doc**

Back testing is there to put an idea to the test.

**Before building rules based on the chart, define a hypothesis.**

**Example:** 

**“What if I traded Dow Jones reversals using 3-wick setups with a 5R limit entry?”**

Then test this visually. On charts

**You’re not trying to make it “fit,” but to ask:**

*- Does this work during valid hours?* 

*- Does the visual match my logic?* 

*- Does the reaction make sense knowing Order flow’s nature?* 

*- Would my setup realistically hit target often enough to net a profit over time?*

**Only then write rules to test.**

# Write Rules as If You’re Giving Them to a Machine

**Your rules must be:**

* **Objective**
* **Actionable**
* **Not open to interpretation**
* **Modest costs ideally <20% Don’t let it exceed 30% of your expected R or your edge collapses (Exponential costs)** ex. If you risk $100 and your RR is 5:1 but after adding spread, comms and other costs like slippage it’s >3.5R / >70% of R realised minimum>$350 minimum on each 5R setup

**Bad Rule:**  
“If the market is ranging, I don’t trade.” **(No definition for range or how to identify it)**

**Good Rule:**  
“If a 3-wick setup forms between 3–9pm UK time, and the high/low of setup is beyond/below \[X filter\], place sell limit at top wick or buy limit at low wick.” **(Rule based intuition/discretion free)**

**Define everything clearly** \- the filter, logic, conditions, etc.

# Stress Test the System by Breaking It

**Once rules are written, test them brutally.** 

Ask:

\- Is this rule based on **logic** or **emotional comfort?** **Be emotionally detached**

  (ex. Breakeven or partial profits reduce strategy net profit - so why use them?)\*

Partials or Breakeven reduce strategy expectancy more often than not\*

\- Does it work over 3+ months of data? (Depending on timeframe)

Date Example August 8**^(th)** to September 13**^(th)** **2024 on mean reversion systems for YM/Dow Jones is a good place to stress test due to the relentless intraday trends exhibited.**

**- What if trading costs rise 20%? (Reduce size of profits by \~20%)**

\- after the initial rejection candle close if there is an additional rejection should I scale in/increase the risk on the trade (Entry 2 typically has higher win rate vs Entry 1 when scaling in for my systems\*\*) testing will confirm whether it's worth doing\*\*. **To scale in or not to scale in**

Scaling in is only worth doing is the win rate if Entry 2 is superior to that of Entry 1 ex. 45% winrate Entry 2 vs 40% winrate (main entries) most systems don't benefit largely from it so **be careful.**

**Entry = Individual Trade Execution (filled with 1R risk per trade ex, 3%) 2 Entries = 3% \* 2 = 6% for example.**

**- Should I hedge or wait until my position is closed to enter setups on the opposite direction?**

**-Is it worth holding overnight?**

**-Do I have enough leverage/margin to trade this strategy on my broker or prop firm of choice (find out the leverage needed maximum per trade with stop distance % relative to % risk per trade desired)**

# You're not seeking perfection, but robustness. 

**If a small change breaks your system - it’s overfit noise.**

# Bonus: When in Doubt, Zoom Out

**Ask: Does this decision happen every trade?**  
If yes, write a rule. If not, STOP, think, and evaluate the logic.

**You should:**

* **Know your risk % – make a rule**
* **Know your stop – make a rule**
* **Aim to know target, stop, and entry price(s) before the candle closes  (Bracketed limit orders help a lot.)**

# Bonus 2: Market Randomness

**I’m not saying the market is efficient, I’m saying it’s very close so you need to be refined in your approach. It’s not a choice**

# Added Annotations [4]:

**\[1\] The specific ratios don't matter. You shouldn't be curve fitting/overfitting your system (trying to find the best ratio)**

Elaboration:

The logic in the example behind using 3-4R in continuation trades is that you should allow for larger movements against your entry because you're entering in the middle of a trend. For example, when trend following, if you're buying, you are executing at premium prices, not at discount prices. more space for error is required.

And 4-5 Ratio for example is encouraging tighter stop losses relative to target for Reversals because you're actively going against the trend.

The ratios given were example ratios you can change them based on your ideas.

**\[2\] When I mean consult logic, I meant order flow mechanics \[3\] which I mention in the document primarily but it's also about rejecting ideas like MA Bounces and Fibonacci which aren't logical reasons to engage with the markets.**

Wick high = selling pressure

Wick low = buying pressure

Body = sustained buying or selling within the time slot on the data series/chart

Use this knowledge to create your own ideas for logical trade entry systems to test

**\[3\] ADF & Hurst Exponent Overview**

ADF shows you if a data series/chart reverts to it’s mean (average price)

Hurst tells you if a data series/chart trends, reverts or leans towards a random walk. Helps decide trending market vs mean reverting market.

**1. ADF Test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller)**

What it ADF tells you in practice:

ADF checks whether a time series is mean-reverting i.e., do things tend to wander off indefinitely, or does it tend to return to some average value over time elapsed.

If the ADF test is “significant” (p-value < 0.05):

The series does revert to a mean.

When a time series ex a candlestick chart is mean reverting imagine price is like a stretched rubber band when it moves away from the average, it tends to snap back/reverse.

If it's not significant (p-value > 0.05):

The series is likely a random walk, drifting unpredictably without any sort of central anchor.

2. Hurst Exponent

What Hurst tells you in practice:

It quantifies how “trendy” or “mean-reverting” a time series is.

H ≈ 0.5 The chart/time series is random noise; random walk/Brownian motion.

H < 0.5 → The chart is mean-reverting tends to snap back.

H > 0.5 → The chart has momentum tends to have extensions/continuation in the same direction i.e trend.

**Key Changes in Version 2 \[4\]:**

Many small tweaks for clarity, added important clarifications especially on Step 7, included annotations for context, and I’ve provided definitions to support beginners.

The model hasn’t changed it’s just explained better. Changes were based on trader insights and needs. Thanks for the feedback. I Appreciate it – Ron.

# TL;DR & Summary:

**Structure before everything.**  
**Logic before data.**  
**Consistency before optimization.**  
Logic → Rules → Data → Optimisation **(Based on ideas, not data or it’s curve fitting)“Why” before “What.”**

**Every rule is based on:**

1. **What you can realistically do**
2. **What the market allows** (ex scalping CFDs is usually not a viable strategy due to higher or exaggerated costs on higher lot sizes) 
3. **What gives clear, repeatable decisions**

**You don’t optimize to improve win rate or net gain.**  
You optimize to enhance the logic behind the system – which often translates to improved performance (net gain)

Yes – the first 0–20 hours (first few testing sessions) will feel foggy. Then it clicks.  
You’ll never know if it works until you test it exactly as written.  
That’s when the market becomes your teacher.

If a system implodes/stops working it doesn't mean a different variation of it can't work again in the future.

1kkfysb,2025-05-11,2025-05-11 20:51:06,I’ve been adapting Hermetic teachings into my forex trading and it’s changed everything.,"Over the past few months, I’ve been diving deep into Hermetic philosophy (especially the Kybalion), and recently I started applying its 7 principles directly to my trading. I didn’t expect much at first, but it’s actually transformed how I view the markets and myself.

Here’s what I’ve learned and how I’m adapting each principle:

1. Mentalism (All is Mind):
Everything starts with mindset. My edge means nothing if I don’t believe in it. So I began visualizing my setups and staying mentally sharp, especially during drawdowns. The market is mental before it's technical.

2. Correspondence (As above, so below):
I started viewing multi-timeframe analysis differently. The patterns I see on the 1H often mirror the 4H. But more importantly, I noticed that when my internal state is chaotic, so are my trades. Trading became a mirror.

3. Vibration (Everything moves):
Markets are in constant motion, just like emotions. Instead of forcing trades, I’m learning to sync with the market's rhythm. I now wait for alignment rather than chase every tick.

4. Polarity (Everything has two sides):
A loss isn’t a failure it's a teacher. Wins and losses are part of the same game. I’ve stopped taking outcomes personally. Now, I focus on being neutral and observing both ends.

5. Rhythm (Everything flows):
I’ve become more aware of trading cycles and my own energy cycles. Sometimes the best trade is stepping away. I try to ride the wave instead of fighting it.

6. Cause and Effect:
Every trade result has a cause. No more blaming “manipulation” or “bad luck.” I dig into my journal, study my behaviors, and focus on the habits that create consistent success.

7. Gender (Dual energies):
This was a big one. Trading isn’t just about aggression or patience it’s about balance. I’ve learned when to act decisively and when to wait with discipline. Masculine and feminine energy both have a place in trading.

Conclusion:
Since applying these teachings, I’ve noticed more than just better results I’ve developed more emotional control, mental clarity, and self-awareness. Trading has become a form of self-mastery, not just a hustle.

If anyone else is on a similar path blending spirituality with strategy I’d love to hear how you’re doing it. Let’s evolve together.",76,31,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1kkfysb/ive_been_adapting_hermetic_teachings_into_my/,year,Discussion,0.9
1nbczo8,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 23:18:11,How do I even start trading from scratch?,"
I recently finished my Master’s in Data Science, but I’ve been feeling drawn toward trading. The problem is, I have absolutely no clue how to even begin.

Do I start with an online course, or should I just dive into paper trading and figure it out? I’m comfortable with data, stats, and analysis thanks to my background, but I’ve never actually traded before.

I could get a little financial support from my dad to start, but nothing major — so I don’t want to burn through money blindly. My main goal is to learn and get a feel for the markets first, and maybe build it into something serious over time.

For those of you who’ve gone down this path:
	•	How did you start?
	•	What resources would you recommend for someone new but analytical?
	•	Should I focus on one area first (stocks, options, forex, crypto), or just experiment?
	•	Anything you wish you knew when you were at the very beginning?

Any advice, book/course recommendations, or even “don’t do it” stories are welcome.

Thanks!

1n6rao8,2025-09-02,2025-09-02 14:23:16,Money is just noise when it comes to trading,"Honestly, it is. Don’t ever think about money while trading - keep your risk to what you’re comfortable losing and analyse the markets and enter your trades boldly. If you lose money so be it. If you make money so be it. It’s noise. 

I was trading today and I didn’t even want to check my trading account to see how much money my trade is “making” instead of focusing on the chart to see how price is behaving. What’s on the chart is pure knowledge and understanding and on the trading account it’s simply just noise. 

If you’re able to analyse the markets and find a solid trade with your conviction and understanding and you’re confident about that trade - what else actually even matters? If the trade doesn’t work out - that’s the best, you have something good to learn right there and that process - I can tell you as a professional trader, the process of learning? It never ever ends. You continue to learn and learn and learn and it doesn’t stop. You do reach saturation levels - like when it comes to learning the market and TA - you reach a saturation point. When it comes to risk management how to manage every position? You learn, adapt and form new ideas and you reach a saturation point. When it comes to psychology- you process things and then it automatically starts working for you, you don’t reach a saturation point there but it just works for you. 

When it comes to a lot of things / you work hard until there’s nothing else to work on but just manage. Until then? Work. And don’t care about money. Like one bit. I see every single trader I’ve ever taught and worked with - they care way too much about money and that’s what’s stopping them from seeing the whole picture. 

The minute the idea of “losing money or making money” comes into your head - you’ve already lost the game. It’s something that sports people and the top level players talk about - you win and lose the game even before entering the court or arena, and they aren’t talking about actually “winning” the game. Just play the sport. Think about it. 

Just my two cents to budding traders. ",76,25,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1n6rao8/money_is_just_noise_when_it_comes_to_trading/,year,Discussion,1.0

1lddw6w,2025-06-17,2025-06-17 00:15:55,What It Really Takes to Become a Trader,"Most people think trading is about finding the right strategy or indicator. They obsess over entries and exits, watching videos, tweaking settings, and chasing perfection. But the real challenge begins the moment you put **real money** into a trade. That’s when your psychology gets exposed. Suddenly, every tick against you feels personal. Every loss feels like failure. And if you haven’t prepared yourself for that reality, you’ll sabotage your own progress.



This is why emotional control is the true skill in trading. Anyone can learn a setup. But very few can execute it consistently under emotional stress. Live trading forces you to confront things most people avoid: impulsiveness, fear of missing out, overconfidence, self-doubt. These aren’t flaws, they’re human. But if you can’t regulate them, you’ll repeat the same destructive patterns over and over again. No strategy can save you from yourself.



If you want to develop real discipline, start small. Use small capital. You don’t need to risk it all to grow, you just need to feel it. Trading live is the only way to build emotional muscle. You’ll stumble. You’ll break down. But if you reflect, learn, and keep showing up, you’ll build a version of yourself that can handle this game. And that’s what separates traders from tourists.

1k4mcrt,2025-04-21,2025-04-21 15:32:01,Trading with a full-time job feels impossible — how do people make it work?,"I’ve been really struggling to find a good trading strategy. After watching tons of clickbaity YouTube videos and going through a few courses, I feel more confused than ever.

I understand the basics of price action, risk management, and trading psychology to some extent. But when it comes to actual strategies, most of what I come across is vague and unclear.

People say beginners should only trade trends. They also recommend having a source of income, like a full-time job — which I do. But here’s my biggest question: How are you supposed to get enough screen time and do the necessary 100+ trades to learn and optimize a strategy when you’re working full time?

Using higher timeframes seems ideal for part-time traders, but those setups come rarely. That makes progress super slow and discouraging. The only realistic option seems to be trading lower timeframes (like 5-minute charts), which some say is fine — but even then, how much time can a full-time worker realistically spend watching the charts?

People suggest backtesting, but even that’s hard without a clear strategy that actually provides decent entries in non-sideways markets. It feels like barrier after barrier.

Has anyone here gone through this? How do you overcome these obstacles as a full-time worker trying to learn trading seriously?

1jwvm69,2025-04-11,2025-04-11 13:33:25,Learning to let go of revenge trading—it's changed everything for me,"There was a time when missing a big move or taking a small loss would send me spiraling. I’d chase price, force trades that had no business being taken, and end up doing way more damage than the original loss ever could.

Revenge trading used to feel like a way to ""get back"" at the market. In reality, it was just me trying to soothe my ego with impulsive decisions. And unsurprisingly, that never worked out well.

But over time—through a lot of journaling, screen time, and mindset work—I started to realize something: missing a move or being wrong isn’t failure. It’s part of the process. The real failure was letting one small emotional reaction lead to a series of bad trades.

What helped me most was simply walking away. If a setup doesn’t play out the way I envisioned, I step back. Breathe. Go outside. Nap. Whatever it takes to reset. That one pause has probably saved me more money than any entry signal ever has.

Now, I see discipline as the win. Missing a move doesn’t feel like a loss anymore—it feels like I stayed in control. And every time I skip the revenge trade, it builds confidence. It's not about catching every move. It’s about catching the *right* ones, from the *right* mindset.

Profitable traders, please guide me.....","I have 1 month left until my summer holiday finishes and I’ve got to go back to school. I’ve been trading on and off for 4 years. I know this is not the way to do it, but this is mainly because I’ve been unlucky and bought some courses that I thought were legit. But I got stuck in a cycle, every course I buy, I spend countless hours studying it because I have good faith it’s going to be the one that makes me money or gets me funded. Then I backtest it and find out it’s BS.

This has made me inconsistent. Now I’ve found a guy I think is legit, BUT AGAIN, I’M REALLY, REALLY TIRED OF BEING IN THIS CYCLE WHERE I BUY, TEST, AND IT’S BS.

So my question to you, “profitable trader”:

1. Do you do this for a living?
2. How much do you approximately make? Like, is it worth it to spend time learning trading?
3. How long did it take you to become profitable?
4. Please tell me—who should I learn from? YouTube and social media are full of scammers. I don’t know who to trust anymore.

Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience with AI in trading. For the last 2 years I've been watching how AI trading models are evolved and now it becomes almost pointless to spend hours on stock research, when model does it for me and picks right stocks in the right time. You can see the chart and how Big 10 Alpha(on builder.limex.com) outperformed the market in last 12 months. I have another strategy that I've created recently and now watching it (10 Stocks SP500 Long). Last week it ranked ENPH as #1 and IQV #2 stocks in the model. My co-worker said that he wouldn't touch ENPH, but I bought few stocks anyways. Turned out that it worked and stocks started to rebound, so model found that fundamentals are good, stock is cheap and it's oversold. Same for IQV and I didn't even know much about these 2 stocks before I saw them on top of the ranking list. The more I use AI models, the more I'm getting used to it and it kinda makes me spoiled :) Guys, what is your experience with AI in trading? 

P.S. I'm also exploring the algorithms that Gemini and ChatGPT generated for me and back testing them on TradingView. But that's a bit more risky, so I'm just playing with it on paper accounts at this time.

1hnlha2,2024-12-27,2024-12-27 13:32:50,S&P 500: What Is Smart Money Doing Right Now?,"Taking a closer look at my charts for the S&P 500, one key observation stands out: **Smart money sold out precisely on time during the latest peak but has not yet returned with meaningful buying activity.**

As shown in the chart, institutional investors - often referred to as ""smart money"" - are cautious. Historically, they wait for **early but robust trends of stabilization** before re-entering the market.

Notably, we’ve seen this behavior before: smart money sold ahead of the U.S. election but re-entered quite quickly afterward, signaling confidence in the rebound. However, this time, they have **not confirmed the latest bounce attempt**, raising questions about the sustainability of the recent rally.

What’s your take—will smart money step in soon, or does this signal more turbulence ahead?

Why? Because I finally understood how to size *based on context*. Most of those losses were small scratches or risk-controlled plays. But when we sweep a key session high/low and I have a clear bullish or bearish context, I go in heavy.

Reviewing my journal made this super clear. I was winning *big* when I waited for high-probability setups backed by market structure. No more random entries. Just reacting to clean liquidity grabs and directional context.

I've come out of my trading journey profitable, but toward the final leg I ended up cutting some positions at losses and obviously a bit upset that I couldnt capture my entire uPnL (which I know is unlikely anyway)- if I had waited a couple more days I would've been at my goal. I stuck to my rules, never got greedy, everything was going perfectly to plan but as market volatility increased, so did my emotions. I was losing sleep, over monitoring positions, literally couldn't do anything but stare at charts. Things spiralled quickly, there was a massive disconnect between my emotional state and very rational positions. My relationships started to fall apart, then the FOMO started to get worse, and the morning I sold everything I woke up having a massive panic attack. Something told me enough was enough and I decided to exit the market entirely. I deleted all my apps so I don't get tempted to look at charts (I still do lol). It's been a few days now, not much has changed emotionally. I'm still looking at charts with FOMO, thinking about what I did, the money I made has not fulfilled me in any way. I left 15% of my portfolio in stables and cashed out the rest. I don't know if it's cope telling myself I sold for mental health reasons, I was also managing my mothers acount (massive mistake) and I ended up selling hers at the same time for a slight profit too. Now I feel like I am in a weird limbo- I don't trust myself, I want market exposure but I fear I'll fall back into the same mental state. Part of me is saying to get my mental together before I even think about getting back in, and there will always be opportunity, and the other part is in extreme FOMO.

Instead of actually learning anything, I told ChatGPT:

""just give me a strategy that tells me BUY or SELL every morning. I don’t care why. I don’t want to understand.""

Here’s the cursed recipe:

•	⁠Load my S&P futures CSV. •	⁠Train a logistic regression. •	⁠Every day it walks forward, re-trains, and then: ⁠•	⁠At the open: BUY if it feels bullish, SELL if it doesn’t. ⁠•	⁠Slaps on a stop loss = 1×ATR, take profit = 1.5×ATR, because why not. ⁠•	⁠If nothing happens? Close at EOD.

That’s it. Zero thoughts, head empty, pure delegation to a chat bot.

The code literally ends with:

2025-08-21 → SELL  (p\_up=0.1195) Open(proj): 6413.5 Stop Loss : 6477.5357 Take Profit: 6317.4464

I’m not even pretending to know why. The model doesn’t explain itself. It just spits out “BUY” or “SELL”.

At this point, I’ve transcended “trader” and become a human execution bot. If it wins, genius. If it loses, blame the machine. Fuck it, lets see how $1k, $30 per position in a 200x leverage goes til the end of the year, if I get to keep $1.

Also, I wrote this in spanish and asked chatgpt to traduce so I don't care the ""thanks AI"" comments.

1jzxoom,2025-04-15,2025-04-15 13:25:37,The 10Y/3M Yield Curve Just Uninverted… Again. Nobody’s Talking About It.,"Not trying to sound like a doomer, but… does anyone else find it *insane* that the 10Y/3M yield curve just uninverted (again) on April 10 and the broader markets are acting like it’s just another Tuesday?

For context: this isn’t just some random line on a chart. The 10-year minus 3-month Treasury yield is one of the Fed’s most trusted recession indicators. It has successfully predicted *every* U.S. recession with uncanny accuracy. What’s crazy is not just that it was inverted—it stayed inverted for **29 straight months**, the longest stretch in U.S. history. That includes 2006–07 (preceding the Great Financial Crisis) and 2019 (before the COVID crash).

Now it’s uninverted… and that’s the real danger.

Historically, the recession doesn’t come *during* the inversion. It comes **after it ends**—when the curve *uninverts*. It signals that recession expectations are giving way to reality. Look at the 1980s: an 18-month inversion ended, and soon after we got hit with double-digit unemployment and peak inflation. Sound familiar?

We’re running up insane debt, tariff wars are back in play, inflation won’t die, and the Fed’s stuck. If the un-inversion is being driven by rising long-term yields (rather than falling short-term rates), that’s not optimism—that’s fear. Fear of inflation, debt supply shocks, or worse—loss of faith in monetary control.

So… thoughts? Are we just collectively ignoring the signal because stonks only go up? Or are we really entering uncharted territory here?",67,31,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1jzxoom/the_10y3m_yield_curve_just_uninverted_again/,year,Discussion,0.92

1m75iih,2025-07-23,2025-07-23 06:21:43,Why My Trade Journal Became My Toughest Trading Mentor.,"When I first started trading, I thought I had it all figured out.

I watched tutorials, joined Discords, followed the “smart money” crowd, and even created what I believed was a solid trading plan. I had indicators, entries, exits, and rules for managing risk. I felt sharp and thought I just needed more screen time and a little patience.

However, after a few months of going in circles—small wins, big losses, and random emotional trades—I realized I wasn’t learning much from my mistakes. So, I finally did what I had been avoiding: I started a trade journal.

I documented more than just my P&L and entry points. I noted why I took a trade, what I was feeling, what the plan was (if there was one), and how I managed it.

That’s when the truth hit me. Honestly, it wasn’t pretty.

Here’s what the journal revealed:

I was winging it far more than I realized. Half of my trades weren’t based on the setups I claimed to follow. They were emotional impulses dressed up as “intuition.” I told myself I was adjusting to the market. In reality, I was just undisciplined.

I had an addiction to being in a trade. It didn’t matter if the setup was great or completely wrong—I just needed to be doing something. The journal showed that most of my worst trades occurred when I was bored or trying to ""make back"" a small loss.

My risk tolerance reflected fake confidence. I wrote that I risked 1-2% per trade, but the journal revealed I constantly moved stops and scaled in against my plan. One bad trade would wipe out a week of progress.

My best trades were the ones I barely touched. They were boring. I followed the plan and let them run. There was no adrenaline or drama, and they worked. I realized I was chasing excitement rather than profits.

I wasn’t patient; I was simply hoping. I noticed how often I forced trades because I didn’t want to “miss the move,” even when the chart clearly said to wait. I mistook activity for progress.

It was humbling. My journal became like a therapist that didn’t hold back. It revealed the version of myself I was too proud to acknowledge—impulsive, emotional, and inconsistent.

But here’s the thing: I didn’t quit. I kept journaling and made it a habit. I even reviewed my worst streaks like a coach breaking down bad film. Slowly, things began to change.

Now, I trade less.

I wait more.

I’m okay with not trading every day.

I protect my capital like it truly matters—because it does.

And I’m finally starting to see consistent results—not just in the P&L, but within myself.

If you’re new to trading or feeling stuck, do yourself a favor: start journaling everything. Not just what you did, but why you did it.

Sometimes, the thing holding you back isn’t the market. It’s you.",67,18,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1m75iih/why_my_trade_journal_became_my_toughest_trading/,year,Advice,0.95

Doesn’t matter if you are trading a multi candle leg, it can always be chunked into a singular candle on a higher timeframe, and that singular candle has a 50% chance of going up or down.

Knowing this, isn’t it foolish how we attach an emotion to one of the two binary outcomes. 

We get happy because randomness played in our favour? That’s so foolish yet so human. 

I think this is the fundamental cognitive dissonance of a trader. Being aware of the markets inherent randomness from a logical perspective yet emotionally feeling attached to an outcome. 

THIS is trading. THIS is what it means to be a trader. Not finding some amazing strategy or doing insane amount of analysis. But approaching the markets consistently knowing you have to fight your very natural instinct to be attached to an outcome.

To accept uncertainty everyday is the biggest challenge. Ofcourse you need a strategy, you aren’t going to succeed without an edge. But an edge is just the tool with which a trader attacks the market. Each swing is going to hit or miss. And you can never predict this beforehand. You just need to survive long enough to take more out of the market than it takes from you.

The pursuit of being a trader is honestly one of the most philosophical and beautiful challenges I’ve ever undertaken. I feel like the act of understanding and managing risk and emotions translates far beyond the realm of just trading, to life itself.

Once you figure out how to gain an edge, you’ll probably never need a real job again. But getting to that point takes a lot more than most people would think.

Lots of beginner traders want to find the perfect technical indicator that will make them profitable, but if such a thing existed, I would have written some python code a year ago to take advantage of it, and I would be a billionaire right now. But I’m not. I’ve used python libraries like TA, PyTorch, and even machine learning algorithms from HyperOpt to backtest hundreds of indicator-based trading strategies, and exactly 0% of them yield consistent positive results. If my crazy machine learning algorithm can’t make an RSI strategy, or a moving average strategy, or any other indicator strategy profitable, then neither can you. 

I’m not yet consistently profitable, but I do have a statistically significant edge with discretionary trading. The way I found that edge was through screen time with the market, statistical analysis of my trades and performance, and deep reflection on my trading psychology. There is no secret sauce. You just have to try stuff until you find something that makes a statistically significant change in your results. 

And to the question of “Why don’t people share what their edge is?” I absolutely can. I trade what most people call support and resistance on the 20 second chart on NQ from 9:45-10:10AM, but I think of it more as trading off of places where price rebounds. But you reading that is not going to make you profitable. You have to spend hours and hours building the intuitions about price movement that I have, and then eventually you’ll get there. 

Stop wasting your time with technical analysis, and start putting your efforts towards real learning. Hope this helps all those beginners out there, and feel free to reply with any disagreements or add-ons.

1ny7n6l,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 18:34:11,The Hooligan Playbook Chapter 3.5,"The Ledger is not an X-Y graph. It is not a cartoon grid. It is a table. One column holds the
Edge Index. One column holds Conviction. The row where they meet gives the Operator a
command.

The Edge Index is the score. Conviction is the side. When the Index is positive, Conviction
leans buy side. When the Index is negative, Conviction leans sell side. When the Index hugs
zero, you are in the shadows.

The Edge Index can be built from price action, but it is not chained to it. The Operator has
freedom to pull in whatever signals they can measure with consistency.

Structure, momentum, and liquidity sweeps might be the foundation. Volatility regimes,
sector rotations, and relative strength between markets can add weight.

If you have access to flow data, open interest, or positioning, those can be factored as well.
The Index is not about using one indicator. It is about reducing chaos to a single number that
is scored the same way every time.

Conviction comes from direction. Sometimes it mirrors the Index. Sometimes it is tested
against a higher timeframe. A trader might have a session-level Index of +3, but if the weekly tape is rejecting new highs, Conviction is marked down. The Ledger captures that friction.

The Operator sees the tension, and the table tells them to size down or wait.

Think of the Ledger as a war table. Across the top are Conviction states: strong buy, weak
buy, neutral, weak sell, strong sell. 

Down the side are Index bands: +4 to +5, +2 to +3, –2 to -3, –4 to –5. Where they cross, the table holds a command. Trade full size. Trade partial. Hedge. Do nothing.

Examples make it real.

Spot Trading: The Index reads +4. Conviction is bullish. The Ledger allows long spot with up
to one percent of risk capital. The Operator buys on pullback into broken resistance. If the
Index fades to +2, risk is cut in half. If it collapses to zero, the table says flatten.

Options: The Index reads +3. Conviction is bullish. The Ledger authorizes call debit spreads with moderate size. If the Index pushes to +4, the Operator can roll the short leg higher or scale in. If the Index fades to +1, the Ledger commands exit.

Mixed Read: The Index reads +2, but Conviction is bearish due to higher-timeframe
rejection. The Ledger commands a half-sized short. In spot, that might be a small starter
position. In options, a bear call spread with tight risk. If the higher timeframe falls back in line with the Index, Conviction shifts and the table allows more size.

The Ledger is built to kill emotion. It does not ask how you feel about Powell, or what Twitter
is screaming. It does not ask whether you are scared or greedy. It only cares about your
numbers and your direction. If they align, you act. If they conflict, you size down or wait. If
they vanish, you disappear.

The Ledger is not about being right. It is about being consistent. If you obey it, you survive. If
you betray it, you bleed.

Here’s what a Ledger might look like on paper. This is not the Ledger you will build. This is
only an example to show how the table works.

+4 to +5 Bullish: Press long, full size
+2 to +3 Bullish: Trade long, half size
0 to +1 Neutral: Probe small or wait
–2 to –3 Bearish: Trade short, half size
–4 to –5 Bearish: Press short, full size

Worked Example (Spot)
The Index prints +3. Conviction is bullish. The Ledger says: half-sized long. The Operator
buys spot ETH on a pullback, risks 0.5% of capital, and plans to scale if Index lifts to +4. If
the Index fades to +1, the Ledger says cut. No emotion. Only the table

Why This Is Only an Example.

If every Operator ran the same Ledger, the machine would sniff it out and hunt it. The market feeds on predictable order flow. Your survival depends on your Ledger being yours. The structure above shows how a table gives commands, but the inputs, the weighting, and the calibration must be your own. That’s the firewall. That’s what keeps you hidden in the
shadows.",1,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ny7n6l/the_hooligan_playbook_chapter_35/,new,Discussion,1.0

Here's my weekend routine:

**Saturday: Review the week**

* Go through every trade I took - wins AND losses
* What did I miss? What economic events actually moved my pairs?
* Journal the emotions around each trade (this is harder than it sounds)

**Sunday: Look ahead**

* Check the economic calendar for the week - which releases actually matter for my pairs?
* Read up on what's happening macro economically in the currencies I trade (central bank speeches, geopolitical developments, GDP reports coming up)
* Review my open positions with fresh eyes - do they still make sense given what's coming this week?
* Make forecasts on my main pairs based on fundamentals, not just technicals

**The key shift:** I used to only look at charts and indicators. Now I spend more time understanding WHY currencies might move, not just predicting THAT they'll move.

It's not as fun as watching price action. But understanding the economic drivers behind currency movements has cut my losing weeks significantly.

I’m a trader (mostly discretionary, some algo) exploring if there is demand for a stat based terminal focused purely on **patterns, events, and price action** (less on fundamentals).

All analysis would be statistically grounded with minimal AI usage (certainly not for the math/backtesting part)

You’d be able to enter natural-language queries like:

1. What happened the last time QQQ went down 3 days in a row?
2. What happened when AAPL closed up 3% three days straight?
3. META is down 7 days in a row, QQQ is up — analyze what happened next (1 week, 1 month).
4. Show me how NVDA performs after earnings gaps of ≥ 3%.
5. List the tickers that rebound most after 5 red days in a row.
6. What’s the average SPY return the week after CPI beats expectations?
7. For the last month has OPEN rallied more in the morning session, overnight session, or PM session?

After entering a query you would get a full backtest, 5+ years with average trade, sharpe, profit factor, charts, etc.

**Looking for honest feedback:**

1. Is this something you’d actually pay for?
2. What kinds of queries or stats would be most valuable to you? (1-7, or others)

I recently invested in a new GPU, an RTX 5070 Ti,  with the goal of using it to train AI models.

I’m a full-stack software developer with over 12 years of experience, so I’m comfortable with Python and machine learning fundamentals.

I decided to work with a Transformer-based model and I’m using tools like Weights & Biases (W&B) and Optuna for tracking and optimization. However, I’ve hit a bottleneck with the features I’m using to train the model.

I’ve experimented with multiple feature sets and even explored feature engineering with ChatGPT, but I’m currently stuck at a 56-57% success rate, which isn’t good enough for what I’m aiming for.

I’ve tried 5-minute, 15-minute, and 30-minute timeframes, but none have made a noticeable difference. I’ve also tested common indicators such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands, among others.

I’d really appreciate any advice or insights on the following:

Is a Transformer model a good choice for this type of problem?

What would be an optimal target definition (for example, 2× ATR profit)?

Which features or indicators tend to be the most valuable?

Which timeframe is most effective for training in this context?

Any tips and tricks?


I’m open to collaboration and happy to share the project if you can provide valuable insights that help improve performance. Any constructive advice or feedback is highly appreciated.

Most traders lose because they do not have rules. They trade on impulse, they chase the last candle, they flip bias three times before lunch. The market feeds on that chaos. The brokers encourage it because every click pays them. The gurus cheer it on because every loss keeps you buying their signals. Without the Ledger you are food.

attack. When the Index is tangled, the Ledger says stand down. You do not waste bullets,
you do not get trapped in the churn. You live to fight another day.

Compounding only works if you are still in the game. That is the part nobody wants to hear.
Everybody talks about doubling accounts and chasing ten baggers, but you cannot compound if you are dead. The Ledger is what keeps you alive long enough for math to take

The Ledger also matters because it kills emotion. Traders blow up when they confuse
conviction with hope. They stay in losers, they press against strength, they fight the tape.

Each one has the same information. Each one runs the Ledger in their own way.

Operator One wakes up and runs the Edge Index. The score is strong, momentum is aligned, volatility is steady. Conviction points bullish. The Ledger gives the command: press long.

Operator One sizes in, not recklessly but with purpose. When price pulls back, they scale.
When the move extends, they hold. The day ends green, not because of luck but because
the Ledger told them to act with size when the stars lined up.

Operator Two runs the same Index. The score is tangled, momentum sideways, volatility
unstable. Conviction is flat. The Ledger gives a different command: do nothing. Operator
Two obeys. They do not trade. They watch retail flail in and out of bad positions. They end
the day flat. No profit, but no wounds. They are alive, and survival is profit in itself.

Operator Three looks at the same numbers. The Index says one thing, their Conviction says
another. They feel bearish even though the Index shows bullish strength. They ignore the
Ledger. They short. The market rips the other way. They double down, hoping it turns. By the
close, they are bled out. They did not lose to the market. They lost to themselves. They lost
because they betrayed the Ledger.

This is the split. Operators who respect the Ledger follow its commands. They are not always rewarded, but they are never destroyed. 

Operators who betray it get harvested. They either die fast, blowing up when they press against strength, or they die slow, bled out by a

consequence. You take your Edge Index and you take your Conviction, and you cross them.
The outcome is not a feeling. It is an instruction.

The Edge Index is the score. It tells you how strong the market is trending, how momentum
is building, how volatility is shifting. The Conviction is the direction. It is the side of the trade you are prepared to press. Alone, each one is incomplete. Together, inside the Ledger, they turn into a playbook.

Imagine it as a grid. On one side runs your Index, from weak to strong. On the other runs
your Conviction, from bearish to bullish. Where they intersect, the Ledger gives you a
command. A strong Index with high bullish Conviction means you press long. A fading Index with bearish Conviction means you position short. A tangled Index with no clear read means you do not trade.

This is where most retail falls apart. They score the market one way, then trade in the
opposite direction because of news or a headline. They feel bearish while their own chart screams bullish. They override themselves and hand their money to the machine. The Ledger prevents that betrayal. It locks you into the truth of your own system.

The Ledger also defines size. When the Index is at full strength and Conviction is aligned,
the Ledger authorizes you to press harder. When strength fades, it cuts your risk. No
emotion, no guess. Your allocation comes from the book, not from fear or greed.

There is no mystery here. It is just structure. But that structure is what keeps you from turning into another casualty. Without it you are gambling in the dark. With it you are running plays that are bigger than any one trade.

The Ledger is not a journal you write in once a week. It is alive. It is your daily script. You
wake up, you score the Index, you note your Conviction, and the Ledger tells you where you
stand. In the fight. On the bench. Or waiting in the shadows for the next opening.

This is how you stop trading vibes and start trading rules. The Ledger is not optional. It is

not your broker’s balance sheet. The Ledger is the framework where survival gets written in
blood and profit.

Every Operator who lasts has one, whether they admit it or not. The suits hide theirs inside
risk departments and quant code. In the underground, you strip it down to what matters. The Ledger takes your Edge Index, the cold numbers of trend, momentum, and volatility. Then it fuses that with your Conviction, your bias, your direction of attack. 

The result is a record that dictates action.

The Ledger is not about predicting the future. You do not need the future. You need rules.
Rules that tell you when to strike. Rules that tell you when to scale. Rules that tell you when
to hedge and when to sit on your hands. You feed your Index and your Conviction into the
Ledger and it spits out the play. No guesswork. No guru hype. No gambler’s hunch.

them. They jump from one hot take to another and wonder why they bleed out. The Ledger

1nxq8lw,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 06:16:33,The Hooligan Playbook Chapter 2.4,"Conviction and Bias

The Edge Index gives you a number. Conviction gives that number teeth.

Conviction is not a hunch. Conviction is a weighted stance, born out of structure. Bullish
conviction, bearish conviction, or neutral. The Edge Index tells you if the market has
conditions worth trading. Conviction tells you which side of the street you want to be on.
Most traders confuse conviction with ego. They feel bullish, so they load up calls. They feel
bearish, so they smash puts. That is not conviction. That is gambling in costume. 

Conviction without framework is suicide. Framework without conviction is paralysis. You need both.

Conviction controls bias. Bias controls sizing. If your Index is strong and your conviction
aligns, you press. If your Index is weak but conviction is clear, you probe small. If conviction is foggy, you pull size down to nothing.

Think of it as a hierarchy. The Edge Index measures conditions. Conviction defines the bias. Bias drives action and sizing.
A strong Edge Index plus strong conviction equals large exposure. A weak Index plus strong conviction equals a test shot. A weak Index plus no conviction means you sit on your hands.

This is how you move from surviving to compounding. The Gambler bets big with no
framework. The Drifter hesitates with no bias. The Operator measures the Index, defines the
conviction, and then executes according to the bias.

Conviction is not about being right on every trade. Conviction is about being aligned with the structure. If the Index shows bullish strength and the conviction is bullish, then every dollar you risk is aligned with probability. If the Index is neutral, forcing conviction is suicide.

The blood machine feasts on traders who cannot define their bias. They flip long, then short, then flat, chasing every move. Every flip costs spread, slippage, and mental energy. The
Operator does not chase. The Operator defines bias. Then the Operator acts.

Conviction is the engine. Bias is the direction. The Index is the map. Together they turn
survival into strategy.

Conviction is not theory. It shows up in the account balance.

Take two Operators, both trading with an Edge Index score of +3. Conditions are strong.
Both see the same breakout. Both have the same tools. The only difference is how they act
on conviction. Operator A trusts the Index and aligns his conviction with it. He sizes into the trade with 1 percent of capital. His bias is clear, bullish. When the move extends, he scales once more.

The trade returns 3R. His 1 percent risk turns into a 3 percent gain. One trade pushes his
month into profit.

Operator B hesitates. The Index says strong, but his conviction is cloudy. He has been
burned before. He sizes tiny, risking 0.25 percent. He exits too early, scalping crumbs. 

The same move that gave Operator A 3 percent leaves Operator B with 0.3 percent. Safe, but
insignificant.

Now flip the coin. The next setup fails. Operator A takes a full 1 percent loss. Operator B loses only 0.25 percent. Both are still in the game. But the difference is in compounding. 

One conviction-driven win erases several losses. Hesitant wins never stack.
Conviction is not about always being right. Conviction is about pressing when the structure says press, and protecting when the structure says protect. It is how you escape mediocrity.

Barber and Odean’s research proved that overconfidence destroys traders. But lack of
conviction is just as deadly in a quieter way. Without conviction, every win is a fraction of
what it could be. Without conviction, the account flatlines.

The Gambler explodes because his conviction is blind. The Drifter starves because his
conviction is absent. The Operator compounds because his conviction is aligned with the
Index.

The blood machine does not care which path you choose. It bleeds the Gambler fast. It
bleeds the Drifter slow. Conviction is the only way out.

1nxpdmt,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 05:22:13,Why most beginners fail in the stock market and how I trained myself to avoid it,"I still remember the night I bought my first single share of Apple. It felt like holding a golden ticket. At the same time, I was terrified because I had no idea what I was actually doing. That’s when I promised myself I wouldn’t just gamble. I’d learn the basics the right way. And I’d read the right books to equip myself in the stock market.

The first thing I realized is that a stock isn’t just a lottery ticket, it’s actual ownership of a company. That shift in perspective hit me when I read Burton Malkiel’s A Random Walk Down Wall Street. He explains that when you buy one share of Coca-Cola, you literally own a slice of the business. It’s not abstract anymore. From there, I learned the two ways you earn: price growth and dividends. I know it sounds simple, but when I looked at my first dividend check (tiny as it was), I felt the connection between patience, ownership, and reward.   

But the biggest lesson wasn’t technical, it was psychological. Behavioral finance research from Barber and Odean showed how most traders actually lose money because they can’t control their impulses. I saw myself in their findings. I wanted to “do something” every hour. That’s when I picked up Mark Douglas’s Trading in the Zone, which drilled into me that trading is allprobabilities, not certainties. That one idea saved me from so many reckless trades.

My first week of notes looked like chaos. Terms like bull market, bear market, P/E ratio, stop-loss, they all felt overwhelming. But I noticed a strange pattern. Every night, when I read even just 20 minutes on stock trading, the fog started to clear. Reading is like weightlifting for your brain, it doesn’t feel like much at the moment, but over months you get sharper. I swear my decision making at work improved too.

Some resources truly carried me. Ross Cameron’s YouTube channel made trading feel less intimidated. His story of starting with $583 and pushing it into millions made me believe consistency beats luck. Then there was the podcast Masters in Business by Barry Ritholtz, where guests like Terrance Odean explained why we sabotage our own trades. These weren’t motivational fluff, they were direct mirrors to my own mistakes.

A friend then introduced me to a new AI-powered app called BeFreed, built by a Columbia University team. It felt like the learning companion I always wished existed. I barely have time to finish thick finance books during the week, but this app takes books, research, expert talks, and even podcasts and turns them into personalized audio lessons. You can pick if you want a 10-minute summary or a 40-minute deep dive. I even chose a “professor” host voice as my stock mentor, which weirdly makes me look forward to listening. What I love the most is how it adapts, the more I listen, the more it learns my style and builds me a personal study roadmap. I’ve already finished more material in two weeks than I did in months of “someday reading.” It’s helping me build a daily reading habit I thought I’d lost.

Other gems I leaned on: Jack Schwager’s Market Wizards (this book will make you question everything you think you know about trading. Insanely good read), and Nick McCullum’s YouTube course on Python for quantitative trading (I finally understood what algorithmic trading means). Each one stretched my brain in a different way, but all reinforced the same truth: daily learning compounds just like money.

I started this journey because I wanted to make smart investments. What I didn’t expect was how much the act of daily reading itself would reshape me. The more I read, the calmer my mind feels, the less I chase noise, and the more I trust the slow compounding of both knowledge and wealth. Knowledge is leverage. It’s the one thing that pays you interest for life.

Most traders mistake a signal for an edge. They see a pattern. They see a moving average
crossover. They convince themselves that is the edge. It is not. A single signal is not an
edge. You only have edge when you measure it inside a framework.

The Edge Index does that job. It tells you when the market is giving you conditions to press
and when the market is telling you to protect. It keeps you out of low quality battles. It keeps
you from guessing.

Institutions run systems like this all day. They track momentum. They track trend alignment.
They track breadth. They track order flow. They roll the inputs into a score so emotion does
not get a vote. Strong score means increase exposure. Weak score means reduce exposure.
Simple. Repeatable. Real.

Your job is not to copy someone else’s math. Your job is to build your own Edge Index. The
framework scales with the operator. Some keep it lean. Some add layers. Some build a full
spectrum model that watches everything. The principle never changes. Turn chaos into a
number. Then obey the number.

Example One: 3 inputs for a simple operator: Trend alignment, Momentum, Market breadth.
Max score plus 3. Min score minus 3. Fast and clean.

Example Two: 5 inputs for an intermediate operator: Trend alignment, Momentum, Market
breadth, Correlation check, Liquidity check. Max score plus 5. Min score minus 5. More
nuance, better for swing trades.

Example Three: 10 inputs for an advanced operator: Trend alignment across multiple time
frames, Momentum blend, Market breadth, Correlation check, Liquidity check, Earnings
trend, Interest rates, Sector relative strength, News flow alignment, Volatility regime. Max
score plus 10. Min score minus 10. Full spectrum. More work. Less noise.

These are examples. Your Edge Index does not have to be 3 or 5 or 10 inputs. It can be
whatever fits your style and your process. What matters is consistency and objectivity.

Here is the rule. Use at least 3 independent metrics to support what you believe the trend is doing. One metric can trick you. Two metrics can argue with each other. Three or more force
confirmation. They keep you honest.

When you find something you believe in — get obsessed.
If you’re trading, live and breathe it. Study the charts like your life depends on it. Journal every single trade. Analyze every move.

And listen up — stop hopping between strategies.
That’s where most beginners fail. They chase shortcuts, copy others, and wonder why they’re stuck. That’s not how you win.
Build your own strategy. Use the fundamentals, use basic SMC concepts, and refine it until it’s yours. That’s how you stand out.

Most people treat trading like a side hustle. That’s why they stay average.
If you actually want to quit your 9-5 and live free — you’ve gotta treat this like a profession. Like a mission. Like your only way out.

Trading is just a skill — and once you master it, you’re set for life.
But mastery doesn’t come from talent. It comes from obsession, discipline, and hours alone when nobody’s watching.

So stop talking. Stop making excuses.
Work harder. Study longer. Get obsessed.
That’s how you change your life.

I’m out — hope this hits the younger generation.

In the early days, my “strategy” was mostly watching influencers on YouTube or skimming quick tips on Twitter, thinking I could piece it together. I’d burn hours staring at charts, jumping between indicators, following news cycles, and second-guessing every move. The wins felt random, and the losses were discouraging. I was in a constant loop of doubt. None of what I was doing felt sustainable, and after a few all-nighters and poorly-timed trades, I hit serious burnout. It wasn’t just about losing money; it was the confusion and anxiety of not truly understanding what I was doing or why.  
  
What pushed me to keep going wasn’t the hope of some “big win,” but the need for a real process, a way to learn in the open, admit when I was lost, and actually connect with others who’d been through the same. I started to notice that there’s a huge difference between chasing signals and genuinely building a toolbox you trust. Too much of trading content out there feels like highlights without the hard parts, and that lack of transparency can make the confusion and burnout worse.

I’m wondering how many here have felt that same burnout, the analysis paralysis, or just not knowing who or what to rely on as you start.

1nxmcfl,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 02:12:23,I Journaled Every Single Trade for 1 Year… Here’s What I Found,"After a full year of journaling every single trade, here’s what the data showed me:



https://preview.redd.it/9lvk9lp4e1tf1.png?width=1755&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a35a21423b7a80176d8d5f079a30bb674679c61

Win rate: 39%



Average R: 2.42R



Net P/L: $30,847



Largest win: $3,050



Largest loss: -$1,137



The equity curve wasn’t perfect, but the growth was steady and “linear-ish.” It wasn’t luck, it was data + discipline.



Here are 5 things journaling taught me:



1. You don’t need a high win rate, risk/reward does the heavy lifting.

For most of the year my win rate sat below 40%. If I judged my trading on win % alone, I would’ve quit months ago. But journaling proved the math: with a 2.42R average, my winners more than covered my losers. It only takes a handful of clean setups executed with size to make a month profitable, even if most trades are small scratches or losers. Now also introducing a new ORB setup too which is around 45% winrate and 2R fixed so it should be interesting



2. Losing streaks are predictable and survivable if you know your edge.

When you track every trade, you can see exactly how long your average red streak lasts. For me, the data showed clusters of 4-6 losing trades in a row were normal. Once I understood that, I stopped spiraling emotionally after 3 losses and could calmly stick to the plan. Journaling turns drawdowns from something emotional into something measurable.



3. Certain times of year/sessions perform better, market cycles matter.

Over hundreds of trades, it became clear that not all market environments are equal. Summer chop dragged down my expectancy, while fall/winter trends lifted it back up. Even within the day, certain hours consistently underperformed. Knowing this helps me conserve energy and avoid forcing trades in low-probability cycles.



4. Tracking expectancy gives confidence when P/L fluctuates.

My expectancy averaged $77.9 per trade. That number became a compass. On days or even weeks where I was red, I could zoom out and know that if I just executed another 100 trades with discipline, the expectancy would play out. Without journaling, it’s too easy to let short-term noise make you abandon a strategy that’s statistically sound. Changed through bearish and bullish cycles also can be supoer scray.



5. The numbers don’t lie. Emotions do.

Before journaling, I always “felt” like I was better or worse than I actually was. Reviewing the data crushed those illusions. Trades I thought were my best setups actually had negative expectancy. Patterns I ignored ended up being my most profitable. The journal doesn’t care about feelings, it’s a mirror of your edge in cold, hard numbers.



https://preview.redd.it/v2cato5be1tf1.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=93856892f2e8709af54259384d6783eb55d1b72b

Journaling exposes your blind spots. I know which trades to size into, which to cut, and how long I can expect drawdowns to last. That’s how you survive this game long enough to let compounding do its work.



So my question to you is, do you know your results this clearly? Do you know what to expect in your market cycles?

excitement, or your fear. Feelings are what the blood machine feeds on. That is how the
Street pulls money out of retail pockets every single day.

The only thing that cuts through that noise is a framework.

A framework is not a hot tip. It is not a guru’s signal service. It is not a gut feeling. A
framework is structure. A framework is armor. It is how you survive long enough to let your
edge play out.

Think about a casino. The house edge can be 2 percent or 3 percent. That looks tiny. But
over thousands of spins and hands, that small edge becomes a guaranteed profit. Players
walk in with feelings. Excitement. Greed. Tilt. The house sits back with math. You already
know who wins.

Trading is no different. Real money runs on frameworks. Funds measure conviction. Funds
measure risk. Funds execute according to systems. Any single trade can lose. Across
hundreds of trades, a real edge with a real framework keeps them alive and profitable.
Retail loses because retail has no framework. The Gambler thinks aggression will save him.
The Drifter thinks following the crowd will save him. Both are food for the machine.

The Operator is different. The Operator runs the Framework. He measures edge with the
index. He sizes according to conviction. He balances his trades with the matrix. He does not care about the outcome of one trade because survival is not built on one trade. 

Survival is built on hundreds.

1nxl8v8,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 01:07:44,The Hooligan Playbook Chapter 1.3,"The numbers are merciless. They cut through the noise and strip away every illusion. They prove what the circus hides and what the trap denies: retail loses, over and over again. In the United States, Barber and Odean (2000) analyzed 66,465 brokerage accounts over a six-year span. They found that the average individual investor underperformed the market by 6.5 percent per year.

The most active traders, the ones convinced they were in control, performed the worst. The more they traded, the more they bled. Across the ocean, Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean (2009) studied day traders in Taiwan. This was no small sample, it included every trade placed by every investor in the market. The results were brutal. The average day trader lost 3.8 percent annually, and only one percent of traders consistently beat the market after costs. The other 99 percent were food for the machine.

In Brazil, the securities regulator CVM tracked 20,000 day traders from 2013 to 2015. After one year, 97 percent had lost money. After two years, nearly 100 percent were gone. The conclusion was unavoidable: day trading for the majority was not a path to survival, it was a conveyor belt into bankruptcy.

The Bank for International Settlements (2019) found the same pattern in forex markets. Over 80 percent of retail accounts lost money within a year. In Europe, regulators now require brokers to publish the percentage of clients who lose. The average disclosure reads the same: 70 to 80 percent lose money.

These numbers span markets, countries, and decades. They are not anomalies. They are the rule. The circus keeps the lights on by selling dreams. The trap keeps traders busy by feeding them leverage and dopamine. But the numbers do not care about illusions. They show what survival really looks like.

And the truth is this: without a framework, you die. Without a system, you bleed. Without discipline, you feed the blood machine. The numbers are the reminder that the market is not fair, not forgiving, and not fooled by hope. They are the scoreboard.

That if you trade longer, harder, with more screens and more alerts, you will beat the Street. The trap flatters your ego, telling you that you are special, that you can
outwork algorithms and institutions armed with billions.

But the trap is not built on work. It is built on design. Platforms are engineered like casinos.
Every scroll, every push notification, every glowing green candle is meant to trigger
dopamine. MIT researchers studying online brokerage accounts found that traders placed
more orders after receiving positive feedback from past gains, even if those gains were
random. This is not skill. This is conditioning. The trap keeps you clicking, because clicks are
blood flow.

Leverage is the trap’s favorite weapon. Retail is handed twenty-to-one, fifty-to-one, or in
options, nearly infinite leverage. The lure of outsized gains blinds traders to the certainty of
outsized losses. The Bank for International Settlements (2019) showed that more than 80
percent of retail forex traders lost money within a year, largely due to leverage misuse. The
trap gives you chips, but the table is tilted.
The trap convinces you that education is enough. Gurus tell you if you just memorize
patterns, you will win. Yet academic research proves otherwise. Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean
(2009) showed that even experienced day traders in Taiwan underperformed after costs.
Knowledge without framework is not an edge. It is just another illusion in the tent.

The trap feeds on overtrading. In a study of 66,000 U.S. households with brokerage
accounts, Barber and Odean (2000) found that the most active traders underperformed the
market by more than 6 percent annually. The trap wants you busy. The busier you are, the
more it eats.

The truth is brutal. The Street does not want you profitable. It wants you active. The trap wins when you trade because you feel like you must, not because your framework says the
conditions are right.

Survival requires breaking the trap. That means fewer trades, not more. Patience, not action.
Waiting until the framework says the conditions align. The Operator knows the trap is
everywhere , in dopamine, in leverage, in overconfidence, and the Operator steps
around it.

you cannot survive it.",4,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nxhd0m/the_hooligan_playbook_chapter_12/,new,Discussion,0.7

is a ringmaster, every platform a carnival tent. They promise secrets, they sell shortcuts, they
package hope as if it were strategy. The crowd gathers, the retail traders pile in, and the
show begins. But retail is not in the seats. Retail is on the stage. They are the clowns, the
animals, the ones being bled to keep the performance running.

The circus thrives on illusion. It convinces traders that excitement equals opportunity. That
the louder the commentary, the sharper the edge. CNBC yells. YouTube streams pump.
Twitter floods with hot takes and chart screenshots. Noise drowns out silence, and silence is
where the edge would actually live. Retail is addicted to the spectacle. Without the show, the
audience would realize there is no magic, only math.

The gurus play their parts well. They flash cars, rented houses, and screenshots of
cherry-picked wins. A 2022 survey by MagnifyMoney found that 58 percent of young
investors said they got trading advice from social media, not from institutions or financial
professionals. The circus works because the crowd trusts the ringmasters. And the
ringmasters keep them dancing long enough to bleed them out.

It is not just social media. Brokers dress up trading platforms with fireworks. When
Robinhood was dragged into congressional hearings after the GameStop saga, they
admitted that confetti and digital celebrations were built into the app to encourage more
trades. This was not education. It was performance. The circus needed volume. The circus
needed blood.

The suits know the show. They do not need to sit in the crowd. They run the tents. They sell
the tickets. Retail pays for entry every time they place a trade without a framework. They
walk into the circus thinking they are buying a skill. In reality, they are buying a ticket to be
devoured.

The circus never ends. When one guru burns out, another pops up. When one tent
collapses, another is pitched. And as long as traders mistake entertainment for edge, the
circus thrives.

For active traders, this setup could change how strategies are executed. It’s less about managing scattered accounts and more about reacting in real time to market conditions. That flexibility matters when volatility opens small windows of opportunity.

The bigger question is whether traders will embrace an all-in-one model like Bitget’s, or continue preferring specialized platforms for each market.

See, if I could restart, I’d focus on one style instead of bouncing between scalping, swing trading, and whatever strategy I saw online. Ive noticed that's what a lot of you guys do, and thays what I did when i was new to trading too. 

That constant switching wasted years. See, I’d build a simple, rule-based system around one setup, journal every trade, and treat it like a business from day one. Journaling felt pointless when I started, it really did... but in reality it was the only thing that forced me to see patterns in my wins and losses. On top of that, I’d make risk management non-negotiable. Back then I thought max loss rules and position sizing were things for “later,” but they’re what would have kept me from blowing up accounts and losing confidence early. Surviving year one should be the real goal, not doubling your account. Just surviving.

The other big shift would be mindset. I wasted too much time idolizing gurus and searching for a magic indicator, when in reality every trader I know who’s still around relies on discipline, execution, and patience. The edge isn’t a secret tool... it’s following your plan even when it’s boring. I also would’ve treated my capital like a startup investment, not gambling money. That means clear expectations, realistic goals, and understanding that profitability takes years, not weeks. If I had approached day one with that perspective, I’d be far ahead of where I am today.

* Revelio: +60,000
* ADP: -32,000
* Chicago Fed Unemployment: 4.3%

1nwxjru,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 08:18:51,Beginner's luck,"Many of of us noticed in others and some experienced themselves the beginner's luck. Some dilettantes have the prolonged beginners luck.

What's behind it? Just the luck? 

Imho behind this luck is an instinctive (do not confuse it with intuitive) trading.  
  
Instinctive player may know nothing of the trading theory, but he has an innate sense of where the market goes, how to run with the crowd, and not against it.  This kind of player can take huge risk ( without realizing it), and stick successfully to the positions which would long before be abandoned by any seasoned trader.  
  
But here is the problem: the day comes and the accumulated experience and wisdom of the instinctive trader overtake his instincts. Fear enters the equation, especially after some big losses. He suddenly realizes that he knows nothing, that he walks on the tightrope, that he needs knowledge, education and experience. He starts reading books, taking courses, attends forums, blogs, etc etc.. and really becomes more knowledgeable than he was before.  


The problem is with the reorientation on knowledge and experience he lost his instincts ...forever...  
  
Another problem is that the knowledge he attained is theoretical.  
  
He never actually had a working trading method before (even though he thinks he had). Now he has the trading method, but his method is a hodge-podge of ideas mixed with some feelings and is not base on found by him the objective laws of the market. One can not trade the ideas and feelings successfully, regardless of how good they are.  
  
And as the result instead of running with the crowd he now runs against it, while doing almost everything what books and courses dictate.  
  
Now he faces a monumental task - becoming a truly methodical trader.",0,7,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nwxjru/beginners_luck/,new,Discussion,0.5
1nwx1i2,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 07:55:09,Losing 5 prop firm accounts doesn’t matter if one payout covers them all,"I used to approach prop firms with a “long-term survival” mentality:

* Never fail a challenge
* Never lose an account
* Play it ultra-safe, as if I’d be trading the same funded account for years

It sounds logical, but in practice it just slowed me down and made passing challenges harder than it needed to be.

Here’s what changed everything for me: I started looking at prop firms through the **payout vs. account cost ratio**.

Think about it this way:

* If I lose 5 challenges, that’s painful, sure… but one solid payout usually covers all 5 losses.
* Once you pass, the real focus isn’t “never lose the account,” it’s **maximize the payout window**. Most firms make you wait 14 days for your first payout. That’s 14 days of trading where the goal is to secure and maximize that payout.

So now my mindset is:

* **Pass quickly** (2–4 weeks per phase is the sweet spot) with an acceptable win rate.
* **Payout focus once funded**: trade actively in that 14-day window and secure as much as possible.
* If I blow the account after securing a payout, the math still works out in my favor.

This shift helped me stop stressing about “never failing” and instead treat prop firms like what they really are: a numbers game where efficiency and payouts matter more than never losing.

That's my 2 cents when it comes to prop trading.",0,11,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nwx1i2/losing_5_prop_firm_accounts_doesnt_matter_if_one/,new,Prop firms,0.5

1nwu19z,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 05:04:43,Any full time profitable traders here? Is it worth it to keep going? I am thinking of quitting,"Hey,

I’ve been trading for about six years now. I started with a lot of learning and basic strategies, and then I got introduced to Guerrilla Trading (a former trading community from London). I learned their strategies, practiced on demo, and did a lot of backtesting.

I managed to pass the FTMO challenge, but ended up blowing the account. After that, I traded live with $1,000 and didn’t blow any live accounts—so I’d say I’ve developed discipline when it comes to managing emotions and sticking to a strategy.

Later, I developed a more aggressive short-term strategy based on the 15-minute chart. But after backtesting and live testing, I’m starting to doubt whether it’s actually profitable.

The Guerrilla Trading community turned out to be a scam and eventually shut down. That said, the strategy itself wasn’t terrible—I just haven’t been able to make it work profitably in the market conditions of the past 2–3 years. After losing a few thousand dollars on learning (losing is not the accurate word her, I learned a lot), testing, and FTMO attempts, I’m feeling pretty lost.

Right now, I’m nearing the end of university and starting to wonder: is this it for trading? Should I let go of the dream?

So I just want to ask—are there any full-time profitable traders here? Is it still worth pushing forward? I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts.If you’re a consistently profitable trader, please share your honest opinion.

There is now a very large short position against the dollar, and the dollar has reached the bottom of the long-term upward moving channel. 

The dollar will then likely rise, which can cause many of the current trade setups exploiting the downward trend of the dollar to unwind, leading to an accelerated upward movement of the dollar. This will then amplify foreign money flows into US bonds, which will further support the upward movement of the dollar.

You can only win in trading when you're thinking of probabilities of profits and losses, based on your strategy. New traders do not think of losses until they encounter one. This triggers them to reaction, which leads to revenge trading and blowing of accounts. The difference between them and experienced traders is that experienced traders know how to take losses and move on. New traders only want positive results or nothing. FYI, the market doesn't know your previous trade was a loss. So if you can take your time before getting in to the next trade, trust me you will make better decisions. Let your future wins cover the losses you've made today.

1nvhlg6,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 15:15:29,Bought at $280. RDDT down again ，Anyone Else Feeling This Pain?”？,"*Hey everyone,*

About RDDT’s price drop today, I’ve been following the news and here are some possible reasons I’ve gathered (of course I can’t be 100% sure):

\*1.\*Slowing user growth / DAU warnings. Recent reports indicate that Reddit’s daily active user growth is falling short of expectations, raising investor concerns about future traffic and user stickiness.

\*2.\*ChatGPT and AI-driven search are reducing traffic and citations from Reddit. This could mean Reddit is getting “bypassed” by AI products, weakening its platform traffic value. At the same time, Google’s AI search upgrades could be a risk for a platform like Reddit that relies heavily on search-driven traffic.

\*3.\*High valuation / overblown expectations. Reddit’s valuation was already rich, and when sentiment shifts, high-growth names often get hit first.

\*4.\*nsider selling. There have been reports of executives and founders selling shares, which can shake investor confidence. Plus, there’s skepticism about whether Reddit can really deliver on its traffic-to-revenue promises.

\*5.\*Sector pullback. Sometimes it’s not a company-specific issue but a broader risk-off move in tech/growth stocks that drags names like RDDT down.

\*6.\*Heavy volume / liquidity factors. According to Quiver Quant, today’s drop came with unusually high trading volume.

These are just the reasons I’ve been piecing together. The sad part? I bought RDDT at $280. I’m posting this to find others who might be in the same boat and hear your thoughts or strategies.

P.S. Some people say my English is bad or that I’m a bot  come on, I’m just a German guy.

Until yesterday. My rules are: a maximum of 2 trades per day, with the second one allowed only if the first is a win; a fixed 1:2 risk–reward ratio; and no staring at the charts. I created these rules because in the past I struggled with overtrading and revenge trading.

Yesterday, I broke them. My first trade (a long) was a loss—the setup wasn’t clean at all. I stayed glued to the chart (probably because I didn’t trust the setup) and got stopped out after 30 minutes. Just five minutes later, a clean setup appeared. Based on my rules, I should have already closed my computer, but instead I kept watching.

When I took the second trade right after that loss, I became emotional and moved my stop-loss (against my rules), even though I moved it into profit. Because I tightened it too much, I got stopped out—only to watch my original take-profit level eventually get hit. That made me angry, and from there I slipped back into tilt and revenge trading mode.

Simulating slippage on every execution

Including liquidity constraints (partial fills, delays)

Always accounting for broker fees/commissions


The idea would be to run the strategy on live market data (demo/forward test), but applying these additional handicaps to verify if the system remains profitable even when everything is stacked against it.

1nv4a49,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 06:12:13,What’s the hardest part of sticking to a trading strategy?,"I’ve been reflecting on the challenge of actually sticking to a trading strategy, especially in the era of endless information, charts, and “expert” opinions floating around. No matter how solid your plan is on paper, something about real-time markets or that one red candle just seems to throw everything into chaos.

Honestly, I find the hardest part isn’t designing a decent strategy, but sticking to it when emotions start kicking in. Sometimes it feels like my brain is wired to sabotage long-term plans for short-term relief. A trade moves against me, and suddenly, all the confidence in backtesting and logic flies out the window.

I’m curious, what’s the hardest part of sticking to your strategy for you? Is it discipline, fear of missing out, or second-guessing your setup? Have you discovered any techniques or mindsets that actually help you stay on track?

Here are a few things we’ve learned from funded traders who survive (and grow) vs. those who crash out early:

* Respect position sizing. If you’re risking too much per trade, you won’t survive the variance.
* Cut losers fast. Hoping for a reversal is how small losses turn into big ones.
* Daily loss limits exist for a reason. They save you from emotional spirals more than you realize.
* Revenge trading is a poison. Chasing back what you lost is usually how you lose even more.
* Zoom out. Focus on weeks/months of results, not whether *today* was green or red.

From our perspective, traders who stick around long enough to scale are the ones who treat losses as business expenses, not personal attacks.",11,2,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nv47i1/keep_these_in_mind_if_you_dont_want_to_lose_too/,new,Advice,0.92

1nuzhw3,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 01:05:15,My Opinion about Trading..change my mind,"Trading is the worst business model I have ever seen it lacks stability and consistency. I know some genius traders will try and tell me how the lack of consistency is with my style but I have mastered my style and for the most part of this year there were completely no setups, the market was very dry. Trading for me will forever remain a side hustle to get some windfall cash once in a while but it's a completely unreliable business model. You are not going to be paying your monthly recurring bills with it. The other thing is unless you are using a well trained bot to replace you, you always have to be there, if you are sick or have moods you make no money due to a high risk of human error. I think other business models are better because with those you can implement systems and AI easily that help it run around the clock. Take for example an online business where you create a website that does the selling for you. You can outsource product creation and you automate prospecting through running ads, all you have to do is manage the system and by this you are just watching out and controlling anomalies that may make the revenue go off track other than that you are free and the money is coming in as you do other stuff. Once you put in the upfront effort you can sit back and relax.  The business runs the majority of the time without you.Trading is not like that once you learn it you still need to be actively participating in it. The worst part about trading is once you have spent time honing these skills for years thinking it's going to be your way out of poverty you realize the skills you have been polishing are not transferrable to another industry, they are extremely niche. So if you are unable to become profitable you are fucked and have wasted a considerable amount of time and money learning something that is very restricted in industry application.This is why it generates alot of scammers, people start with good intentions hoping they will be rich, they realize its difficult to learn, they have spent years and money trying to master it but are still not profitable and that is when they realize this business aint it and they need to make up for all the time and money lost, so they decide to become the shovel sellers, selling shovels to the people going after the gold rush.",9,135,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nuzhw3/my_opinion_about_tradingchange_my_mind/,new,Discussion,0.63

The market has been unbelievably resilient and it just makes me think how much longer we can sustain prices we’re at right now before a huge correction. Regardless, I’m trading my setups no matter what direction the market moves, and I’ve more confident than ever. 

Took the trade above today as well, which was a beautiful hidden bullish divergence on QQQ. This was closer to EOD, but looked too good not to take. 

As you can see we’re making higher lows in price, and the TSI below is making lower lows. This is a textbook hidden bullish divergence, AKA continuation of trend.

   1. If you fully use the 10x leverage extension, your maximum possible order value is 1,000,000 USDC.,
   2. If you fully use the 10x leverage extension, your maximum possible order value is 100,000 USDC.,
   3. This means your Account currently holds 100,000 USDC.,
   4. You will always borrow 100,000 USDC when buying BTC.
2. *\[*23:22*\]*Your last executed trade was under 10x leverage. Your current Maintenance Margin currently is USD 10,000, the current Margin Balance in your Unified Trading Account is USD 10,500. What does this mean and what should you do next?
   1. Your Maintenance Margin Rate is close to 100%. Take action to avoid liquidation by repaying borrowed crypto-assets or depositing more collateral into your Unified Trading Account.,
   2. Your Maintenance Margin Rate is below 10%. At 10x leverage, your Margin Balance is multiplied by 10, so your liquidation risk is low.,
   3. Your Maintenance Margin Rate is close to 100%. Consider reducing your leverage to lower the overall risk in your Unified Trading Account.,
   4. You're not at risk of liquidation as long as your Maintenance Margin doesn’t drop to zero.,
3. Assuming USDC has a Collateral Value Ratio of 100% and BTC has a Collateral Value Ratio of 95%. How does the Collateral Value Ratio may impact your liquidation risk?LastNewLifeBULL *—* 23:26 
   1. The Collateral Value Ratio doesn't affect your liquidation risk. It only determines the value of crypto-assets when repaying loans.,
   2. If you hold $1,000 worth of USDC, your liquidation risk is lower than if you hold the same value in BTC.,
   3. A higher Collateral Value Ratio leads to a higher liquidation risk when borrowing crypto-assets from Bybit EU.,
   4. All BTC held in your Unified Trading Account are always subject to the same Collateral Value Ratio.,
4. *\[*23:28*\]*How does 10x leverage impact your exposure to fees?
   1. You will be exposed to higher borrowing fees but your liquidation risk does not increase, as you will only pay your borrowing fees at repayment of the crypto-asset loan.,
   2. A higher leverage level will have no impact on the amount of fees paid.,
   3. Your holding duration does not negatively impact your fee exposure as borrowing fees will only be calculated at the repayment of the crypto-asset loan.,
   4. A higher leverage level generally results in a higher amount of borrowed crypto-assets. This results in higher borrowing fees and negatively impacts your liquidation risks.,
5. *\[*23:29*\]*How does increased market volatility of ETH price impact you under Cross Margin Mode, if you hold ETH in your Unified Trading Account?
   1. You will not be impacted if you only trade a BTC/USDC pair with 10x leverage.,
   2. If you only borrow USDC, ETH price volatility won't affect your liquidation risk.,
   3. A sudden drop in ETH price could reduce your Collateral and trigger liquidation.,
   4. Repaying all your ETH loans will eliminate your liquidation risk

Question 1: Imho answer 1 and 3 are correct.  
Question 2: 1 and 3 might be correct. In reality I would try to avoid liquidation cascads here, but I felt (and chat gpt agreed) they wanna hear 1 here.  
Question 3: Answer 2 has to be correct?  
Question 4: I assume I went with 4, but the FAQ might suggest 1.  
Question 5: It has to be 3?

1nuqgo1,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 17:53:49,Bringing Hedge Fund/Mid Frequency Trading to the Masses,"I have been a quant trader in high frequency trading (e.g. IMC, Optiver, Citadel, HRT, Jane) for 10+ years. I have made enough to retire comfortably but I've been ruminating quitting my job to change the finance industry. Most of the mid-frequency trading strategies (stocks, options, cryptos) have high sharpe and are not too difficult to replicate. I have talked to my friends at hedge funds, long-short equity funds and they feel similarly. However, retail investors have historically not have had access to these strategies.

The platform would serve as a bridge for talented traders and quants—whether experienced professionals or successful independent day traders—who want to run their own strategies outside of traditional institutions. Each trader would have a profile featuring their background, optional backtests, and high-level strategy information. Customers could review these profiles, allocate capital to the traders they trust, and have trades automatically executed in their IBKR accounts on a proportional basis. Traders would only see aggregated assets under management, not individual portfolios. Traders would get management fees and/or profit share but this would be much lower than traditional institutions. However, this model has its limitations including execution quality and limitations around implementing certain complex options strategies

I know currently there are copy trade platforms (e.g. eToro, Echo Trade, Autopilot etc) but they all seem a bit scammy/meme. In **Phase II**, the goal would be to evolve into a licensed custodian, enabling execution through advanced venues such as dark pools, lit markets, RFQs, and auctions. This would significantly improve execution quality for customers. Additionally, this would enable fractionalization of equities and options, allowing traders to implement more sophisticated strategies typically reserved for institutional funds. Over time, as the user base grows, we would also invest in infrastructure—such as microwave networks and colocation facilities—to compete more effectively with high-frequency trading firms. To protect investors, traders would operate under defined risk and drawdown limits, ensuring disciplined portfolio management and preventing excessive risk-taking.

Make a profitable system grounded in logic with predefined rules regarding the entry logic for every entry, risk management and trade management ahead of time; with that, you won't need to think about anything when pressing the button. Design your strategy so specifically that you have at least a good idea where your target, stop and entry are before your entry signal completes.

**It's so much easier to be disciplined if you know the exact thing you're looking for on every trading session, people underestimate this. Ditch grandiose frameworks and trade something pre-defined, repeatable and real.**

[Example Purposes Only](https://reddit.com/link/1nufjlk/video/hxevid198hsf1/player)

Example: When you don't have to think about where your target is because you know the specific rules and sequence for every possible target things become ultra-relaxed.

Before my formation is complete I know where my entry price, stop, and target are on most iterations. **That's real freedom. Zero decision fatigue.**

The only decision I leave myself with is putting that trade on.

1nu0q64,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 21:55:43,The Silent Struggle of Trading,"What most people never see about trading is the silence.



It’s the hours spent in front of a screen while the rest of the world goes on without you. It’s friends not understanding why you’d rather journal your trades than go out. It’s family asking if this is “just a phase” while you quietly build a future they can’t imagine.



That silence is heavy but it’s also where the magic happens.



In the quiet, you find focus.

In the routine, you find strength.

In the loneliness, you find yourself.



Trading isn’t about noise, it’s about peace. The freedom you’re chasing won’t come from being understoo,it comes from doing the work when no one is watching.



So if you feel distant, disconnected, even misunderstood, know this: you’re not lost. You’re just walking a road most people will never dare to step on. And if you keep going, the freedom, the success, the peace… it will all be worth it.

* The layout's super straightforward. I tried other sites before but they felt kind of overwhelming, this one just lets me focus on practising.
* I like being able to look back and see how I did over time-it makes it easier to spot when I'm falling into bad habits (like jumping into trades too fast).

Paper trading feels inefficient, mostly because most people don't use it long enough to truly test and validate their strategies. And if they would, then it would take years! And even if you did everything perfectly, then you woudn't get the emotional strength required for trading.

# Academic and Institutional Studies & Serious Books

**This document is for anyone curious about the reasoning behind our process and thinking, or for those seeking deep trading knowledge.**

***Pause and read when something piques your interest. Judge by citation.***

**1. Random Walk & Market Efficiency**

**Eugene Fama - THE BEHAVIOR OF STOCK-MARKET PRICES**

**Key Part:**

“By contrast the theory of random walks says that the future path of the price level of a security is no more predictable than the path of a series of cumulated random numbers. In statistical terms the theory says that successive price changes are independent, identically distributed random variables. Most simply this implies that the series of price changes has no memory, that is, the past cannot be used to predict the future in any meaningful way”

**Note:**  
We are not suggesting the market is 100% efficient/random. We referenced this to show how randomness in a market isn’t good for your bottom line. The more efficient/random a market is the harder it is to trade profitably

**Eugene Fama - Random Walks in Stock Market Prices.**

**Key Takeaway:**

if the random-walk theory is an accurate description of reality, then the various “technical” or “chartist” procedures for predicting stock prices are completely without value.

 

**Burton Malkiel - A Random Walk Down Wall Street**

**Key Lines:**

“A random walk is one in which future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past history. When the term is applied to the stock market, it means that short-run changes in stock prices are unpredictable”

“Mathematicians call a sequence of numbers produced by a random process (such as those on our simulated stock chart) a random walk. The next move on the chart is completely unpredictable on the basis of what has happened before.” – **Referencing Random Candlestick Charts**

[A Random Chart](https://preview.redd.it/vub60qytg4sf1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d82d67028281adb41fc414a6e4cc7c8c85bfa2d)

[Another random chart designed to look like S&P 500 Futures \(ES\)](https://preview.redd.it/bl1fhs0wg4sf1.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=714b9c45ad9d847d4ecf8559d79ea41bb4449868)

**The core lesson of the random‐walk theory is that you cannot predict future market price movements by studying historical data if the market is 100% random.**

 

**2. Alpha/Market Edge Decay & Why no profitable trader would sell or give away their strategy for free.\[1\]**

**Julien Penasse - Understanding Alpha Decay**

 

**Highlights that alpha (edge over market) tends to diminish. alpha decay is generally a nonstationary phenomenon/inconsistent. Julien leverages studied anomalies for credibility.**

**Key Parts:** “Because alpha decay is generally a non-stationary phenomenon, asset pricing tests that impose stationarity may lead to biased inference. I illustrate the importance of alpha decay using the most commonly-studied anomalies in the asset pricing literature”

“Alpha decay refers to the reduction in abnormal expected returns (relative to an asset pricing model) in response to an anomaly becoming widely known among market participants” **\[1\]**

 

**This is popular, modern and potent evidence that alpha decay and edge decay is real.**

**Does Academic Research Destroy Stock Return Predictability? - Journal of Finance, R. David McLean**

**Published in 2016**

**Key takeaway:**

“Portfolio returns are 26% lower out-of-sample and 58% lower post-publication. The out-of-sample decline is an upper bound estimate of data mining effects. We estimate a 32% (58% - 26%) lower return from publication-informed trading.”

 

**On the Effect of Alpha Decay and Transaction Costs on the Multi-period Optimal Trading Strategy** by Chutian Ma and Paul Smith (2025):

The approach shown on this paper captures the essence of alpha decay by allowing the strength of signals to wane as they age, reflecting reality where the effectiveness of trading signals decrease over time. Re-enforcing the idea of edge / alpha decay.

Present in the ABSTRACT: **“To simulate alpha decay, we consider a case where not only the present value of a signal, but also past values, have predictive power”**

**3. Intraday Seasonality & Session‐Based Rules**

**Admati & Pfleiderer - A Theory of Intraday Patterns**

**Key Parts:**

Paper documents intraday volume & volatility U‐shape across NYSE hours.

Ex Table 1 show how volume and volatility vary through NYSE hours.

**4. Mean Reversion vs. Trending Characterization**

**Intraday mean-reversion after open shocks: Grant, Wolf, and Yu (2005) document strong reversal effects in US equity index futures**

**Key Lines:**

This paper gives a long-term assessment of intraday price reversals in the US stock index futures market following large price changes at the market open. We find highly significant intraday price reversals over a 15-year period (November 1987-September 2002) as well as significant intraday reversals in our yearly and day-of-the-week investigations. Moreover, the strength of the intraday overreaction phenomenon seems more pronounced following large positive price changes at the market open.

 That being said, the question of whether a trader can consistently profit from this information remains open as the significance of intraday price reversals is sharply reduced when gross trading results are adjusted by a bid-ask proxy for transactions costs.

 

**Rama Cont - Empirical Properties of Asset Returns**

**Key Lines:**

Table 1 lists “Volatility Clustering” and “Gain/loss asymmetry” i.e Mean reversion characteristics for major indices.

 

**5. Backtesting**

**Bailey, López de Prado & Zhu - Pseudo‐Mathematics and Financial Charlatanism**

**Key Lines**

We prove that high simulated performance is easily achievable after backtesting a relatively small number of alternative strategy configurations, a practice we denote ‘backtest overfitting

The higher the number of configurations tried, the greater is the probability that the backtest is overfit... Under memory effects, backtest overfitting leads to negative expected returns out-of-sample, rather than zero performance.

**6. Order Flow, Microstructure and how markets work**

**Albert S. Kyle - Continuous Auctions and Insider Trading**

**Key Lines for us:**

**Albert S. Kyle** “Perhaps the most interesting properties concern the liquidity characteristics of the market in a continuous auction equilibrium. ""Market liquidity"" is a slippery and elusive concept, in part because it encompasses a number of transactional properties of markets. These include ""tightness"" (the cost of turning around a position over a short period of time), ""depth"" (the size of an order flow innovation required to change prices a given amount), and ""resiliency"" (the speed with which prices recover from a random, uninformative shock). Black \[2\] describes intuitively a liquid market in the following manner: ""The market for a stock is liquid if the following conditions hold: (1) There are always bid and asked prices for the investor who wants to buy or sell small amounts of stock immediately. (2) The difference between the bid and asked prices (the spread) is always small”

Kyle breaks down what Market liquidity is and What makes a market liquid showing that imbalances between buyers and sellers i.e. imbalance in liquidity is the reason why price moves. To us this is obvious but many traders don’t consider it.

 

**Trading and Exchange: Market microstructure for practitioners - Larry Harris**

Parts 1.5, 3.10, and 3.11 were well written and more on point; Part 3.12 is an amusing read too.

It’s a lot less intense when comparing to market microstructure theory, and he uses humorous terms which keep things engaging, making it a nice gateway.

 

**Maureen O’Hara - Market Microstructure Theory**

**Key Chapters:**

Chapter 1-5 covers how liquidity and order flow mechanics underpin price formation.

**Maureen O’Hara - High Frequency Market Microstructure**

**This paper reveals how modern markets are different and contains heavy discussion of HFT involvement in modern markets.**

**Born to choose: the origins and value of the need for control**

Lauren A Leotti 1, Sheena S Iyengar, Kevin N Ochsner

The innate feeling of needing to be in control of outcome in human psychology (The root of most trading pain & desire for discretion in trading)

**Present in the ABSTRACT:**

""Belief in one's ability to exert control over the environment and to produce desired results is essential for an individual's wellbeing. It has repeatedly been argued that perception of control is not only desirable, but is also probably a psychological and biological necessity. In this article, we review the literature supporting this claim and present evidence of a biological basis for the need for control and for choice-that is, the means by which we exercise control over the environment. Converging evidence from animal research, clinical studies and neuroimaging suggests that the need for control is a biological imperative for survival, and a corticostriatal network is implicated as the neural substrate of this adaptive behavior.""

**The Role of Financial Instruments in Reducing Exchange Rate Risk Vlora Berisha, Rrustem Asllanaj**

\- For context from Ron: Total Return Swaps (TRS) and Contract for Difference (CFDs) are similar in that both allow you to gain exposure to an asset’s price changes/performance without owning it outright. You benefit from price changes and, depending on the contract & type even receive or pay income like dividends or interest. Both involve paying financing costs if you hold positions overnight (swap fees)

# Definitions written by Ali (SentientAnalyzer)

**1.Constraints**

What limits you - time, capital, lifestyle. These set the boundaries for what you can actually trade. Your system must respect them.

**2. Market Type**

Behaviour of a market: mean reverting, trending, or random/alternating.

**3. Valid Trading Window**

The hours when you’re allowed to trade. Based on where volume and volatility are, not your convenience.

**4. Risk (R)**

The set amount of capital you’re willing to lose per trade. Fixed, consistent. Example: 1R = 3%.

**5. RRR**

Risk-to-reward ratio (e.g. 1:3 = risk $100 to make $300).

**6. Order-Flow Mechanics**

Price moves because buyers and sellers are imbalanced. That’s it. It explains rejections and moves - it’s not an edge, it’s just reality.

**7. 3-Wick Setup**

Three wicks rejecting a level - signals price has repeated selling activity and won’t break through. Must be rule-based, not subjective.

**8. Tick**

The smallest price increment on an instrument.

**9. Execution**

Cost Spreads, commissions, and slippage affecting net performance. Ignore it and your edge vanishes.

**10. Backtest**

Testing your rules on past data. Done honestly - no scrolling, no cherrypicking, no hindsight. Bar Replay below in

**11. Overfitting**

When your strategy works only on the past because you’ve shaped it to work on past historical data instead of applying and idea to historical data. Looks good in testing, fails live.

**12. Stress Test**

Deliberately run your system in bad conditions. These are notable periods of intraday chop, low volume on trend trading strategies and periods of relentless trends on mean reversion/reversal strategies. If it collapses, it’s weak.

Example: Someone could be running a mean reversion day trading system on YM and he could stress test August 8th to September 13th 2024 as an example, where, here Dow Jones exhibited strong trending behaviour which is against the system’s nature.

**13. Bar Replay Play**

charts forward candle by candle to mimic real-time. Helps you test if you’d actually take your setups live. E.g., TradingView Bar Replay

**14. Scaling In**

Adding size after entry. Must be planned and tested - not just done because “it looks good”.

**15. Hedge**

Open a position benefiting from movements in the opposite direction. Useful at times, but messy if you don’t have clear rules.

**16. Breakeven/Partials**

Closing part/all of the trade early. Often reduces long-term edge unless justified by data.

**17. Ghost Liquidity**

Orders that aren’t visible but sit around visible levels. Cause sharp reactions or none at all. It’s just a surge of liquidity that isn’t visible on the books.

**18. Random Walk**

Price sometimes moves like noise. Most patterns don’t work unless they’re backed by logic. A Random Walk is a market that is 100% random. In other words, it is effectively a completely efficient market where no edge is possible. Real markets are of course different.

**19. Bracketed Limit Orders**

Pre-set entry, stop, and take-profit. Forces discipline. Removes intuition and discretion.

**20. Institutional Narrative Fallacy**

The idea that “smart money” always leaves clues. Usually marketing fluff. If it’s not testable, it’s not valid.

**21. Data Snooping**

Repeatedly looking at a data series from different angles to confirm something that you haven’t defined ahead of time often leading to insignificant and/or biased discoveries. Essentially looking too hard for patterns and finding things that don’t actually repeat. Typically kills forward performance.

**22. Drawdown**

How far your strategy drops from peaks in tests. Crucial for knowing how big your positions should be in advance. For example, a trader could have a max losing streak of 8 but your peak to trough could be 12x your risk (some wins followed by strings of losses repeatedly create this) – Super important to track and know. That’s the maximum drawdown you should be taking into account especially if working with prop firms.

**23. Dynamic Targeting**

Set targets based on real market structure - swing highs, lows, clusters of wicks. not arbitrary price movements e.g., 100 points, 100 handles, 100 pips, 100 ticks. Market is too dynamic for a one size fits all.

**24. Expectancy**

The average gain or loss per trade. Strategies don’t need high win rates - it needs consistency in the data and logical backing: Expectancy = average win × win rate − (1 − win rate) × average loss.

**25. Logic-Driven Rule** A rule built on how the market behaves - not what a shape on a chart looks like or some untested theory. For example purposes only, using the 3 wicks example. Bar 1 closes with a wick high; this shows that there was selling pressure. If the next candle interacts with bar 1’s high but fails to close above, creating another wick, it shows continued selling pressure. If on bar 3 it happens again, it shows compounded selling pressure. If it reverses, it should do so quickly. If price continues beyond the wicks, price should continue trending. Using a small stop loss relative to the target can create an edge if costs are managed properly.

**Daily Chart (D1)**

We continue to maintain the bullish projection of the triangle, with a target toward the **3860 USD** level.

The bullish intent remains valid, although it is beginning to show signs of weakening.

We detect a **bearish divergence** between the price and our **SmartMass** indicator, which indicates that the upward momentum is weakening and could anticipate a correction or consolidation before resuming its upward drive.

The key support to watch is around the **3700–3720 USD** zone, coinciding with previous price reaction levels and technical projections.

**4H Chart (H4)**

The price has reached a very high momentum, moving significantly away from the main trend.

The upward movement is approaching a **parabolic move**, which is usually associated with impulsive climax phases.

The **SmartMass** indicator confirms this reading, showing signs of excessive momentum and suggesting that a **two-leg correction** is likely to test the main trend line.

Currently, the price has formed a **final flag pattern (FF ch)** of a channel type, which could anticipate the start of a significant correction within the overall trend.

**Technical projection:** the first corrective leg could take the price toward the approximate level of **3707 USD**, corresponding to the end of the second leg (**LEG2**).

If you’ve tried either (or both), I’d love to hear your experience and advice!

	1.	Short setups into weakness – fading failed pushes when the market shows cracks.
	2.	Momentum setups into strength – stacking into directional moves once the market confirms trend and velocity.

Both work if managed right, but the psychology is totally different:
	•	Short setups feel great when you nail the turn, but they punish you hard if you’re early.
	•	Momentum setups feel “safer” following strength, but they can chop you up if trend stalls.

Do you lean toward shorting weakness or pressing momentum, and why?

1nspxmr,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 10:36:53,Market Conditions and Sector Strategy," The 1990s Market Environment 

In the 1990s, the U.S. stock market experienced a period of rapid and extraordinary growth, largely fueled by the dot-com boom. Technology stocks surged as investors poured money into internet-based companies, many of which had little to no earnings. During this period, annual returns averaged an astonishing 16.1%, nearly double the historical average. This unrestrained optimism eventually created the dot-com bubble, which burst in the early 2000s, leading to a sharp decline in valuations and painful lessons for many investors. 

Today’s Market Conditions In contrast, today’s market is more balanced, though not without challenges. The S\&P; 500 is showing modest growth, reflecting investor optimism, but several headwinds exist. Persistent inflation and the introduction of new tariffs add uncertainty, reminding traders to approach the market strategically. Analysts see some similarities to the 1990s in the form of high enthusiasm for technology-driven growth. However, the modern market benefits from a more informed investor base and stronger regulatory oversight. Today’s optimism is backed by tangible advancements in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and electric vehicles—sectors with clear long-term potential, unlike many of the speculative dot-com startups of the past. 

The Role of Sector Rotation Sector rotation continues to be a critical strategy for traders and investors. During expansion phases of the economy, cyclical sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary, and industrials often outperform. On the other hand, when markets weaken or uncertainty rises, defensive sectors like healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities tend to provide stability. Understanding these cycles allows traders to anticipate shifts and position their portfolios accordingly, capturing opportunities while managing risk. 

Swing Trading and Sector Awareness For swing traders, combining sector rotation principles with short-to-medium-term positions can be especially effective. Swing traders can use sector ETFs to gain broad exposure, while also selecting individual stocks that align with the prevailing sector trend. Reviewing sector performance weekly and making timely adjustments helps traders remain in sync with the market’s rhythm. This blend of strategy adds both flexibility and diversification to a swing trading approach. 

Conclusion 

While today’s market offers growth opportunities, it also carries risks that demand careful attention. Unlike the unchecked exuberance of the 1990s, the current environment is a mix of optimism and caution. By staying adaptable, focusing on sectors aligned with the economic cycle, and blending broader awareness with specific trades, investors and traders can position themselves for success in a complex and evolving market.",1,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nspxmr/market_conditions_and_sector_strategy/,new,Technical analysis,1.0

1nsndb0,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 08:41:53,Probability/Statistics guidance needed for warrant trading with rollovers and no Stop-Loss,"Hello,

I have been trading for 3 years, focused on index warrants, and I want to get serious about quantifying risk, drawdowns, and position sizing using probability and statistics.

Here’s my setup:

* \~300 trades/year
* I don’t use stop losses. Losing positions are held until reversal, historically \~14 days on average. I roll over warrants with a 9–12 month expiration window
* I trade both directions (calls and puts)
* Occasionally, extreme trades happen: \~2 per year were historically “unrecoverable.” I either offset them gradually with profits or, if critical, cut them and move on.
* I currently use fractional Kelly (\~1/6) for position sizing.

My goals:

1. Estimate the tail risk of ruin and portfolio survival over multiple years, accounting for different trade counts.
2. Optimize position sizing / Kelly fraction considering the above risk calculations.

I have intermediate Python skills. I’m looking for practical guidance on where to start and focus, which methods/theories are directly applied to this case.

Appreciate any help/resource/2cent.

1ns94pi,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 19:10:50,2 years in and I'm losing myself.,"To give a bit of context, I started trading when I was 15, after countless trials and errors with multiple so-called ""ways to get rich"" you'd find on social media. It struck me instantly when I started learning about it and it grew a part of me which I didn't know I had; I truly enjoyed the dirty work, my mind shifted towards the mindset of ""work hard now, be free later"". And I loved it. When I woke up in the morning I had that burning fire in me, comparable to the feeling you get the day you'd take the plane going on vacation.

I was learning quick and worked towards surrounding myself with likeminded people online since none of my friends were willing to take the leap. As you'd expect the first year, I didn't achieve mind blowing results, though I made profits the year being 2024 meaning it was green everywhere for crypto (I mainly trade BTC). My dad supported me from the start, always being there to hear about my breakthroughs, struggles and growth; Or so I thought. He started off small asking about my profits and how it was going. But I had hit a threshold after the bull run turned into a sideways market so I didn't have much to show. I was effectively going sideways with the market for a couple of months. That's when I learnt my dad actually thought trading didn't work: ”I don’t believe it works” - “Focus on your studies it’s more important than this crap you’re doing” - “You’re better off investing your time in something valuable for your studies” were his words. All of a sudden the only person I confided to and thought would always support me was gone. This was in June of 2024 and ever since that day, my life has been going downhill. Not too long after that I lost contact with most of my trading connections due to them graduating high-school and moving on from trading.

To talk a bit more about my trading style which is important to the story, I usually take 1to 5 trades a week solely depending on the market conditions. 
I consider my strategy to be the ""rare occurrence high win rate"" type. I find it complicated back-testing it as it's not an easy enough concept that I can code to test on previous markets or find myself in a short amount of time (30-45min per trade). On a small sample of 17 of  trades ranging from 2.5RR to 5RR, I made money on 65% of them, 47% hit full TP and only 29% lost me money. Now I know this might be just luck, but keep in mind those were live trades, following my perfected plan which I found not too long ago (November 2024 - February 2025 is the timeline for the testing).
So there I was, all alone with just my will to keep going. I somehow managed to last the whole winter locked in on my goals. The end of the school year was approaching and my dad had to add on my struggle, giving me ""The father’s speech"" as a lot may have already experienced it. This time I understood by his tone he wasn't joking around anymore. He pressured me to let go of trading and focus on my exams coming up in a couple of months. For the next couple of months, every time I opened up, my parents’ eyes fell on my hard work with contempt, crushing the pride I had felt only moments before.

I'm closing in on my last season to prove them wrong before I graduate. I don't feel anything anymore when I open the charts even though I have tradingview set as a startup app; I just close the window immediately. I would do anything to go back to how it was. I don't know what I'm looking for by typing this out but I would say this is bringing me one step closer to making it out of this hole.

1ns0d47,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 13:01:54,You lose because you don’t understand averaging down,"Somewhere some guru heard a hedge fund guy talk about averaging down. And then the guru took that gambling mentality and sold it as a strategy. Most of the time it works.

Listen carefully.

Most of the time it works.

That’s the trap. 

When it doesn’t. Game over.

You’ve been doing it wrong. Again. Stop it. Pay attention. And learn how to stop losing. 

If I average down, I’m usually spot trading. I don’t do this for options as that’s already set for optimal convexity. 

Your SL should be away from the violence. I mean way away. Like whatever you think is away, more away. 

Your SL is in the back with the binoculars watching the fight carefully. That’s where your max loss is. 

Again. Max loss. So if that’s 1% that would be there. A huge ass swing in the wrong direction and then it takes you out at one percent.

Now, when you enter, don’t enter in your full position. Wait. If it goes on, fine let it. You can scale in later. 

But now, if it pulls back. Get in again. Now what you’re doing is sort of averaging your midpoint of the trade. You’re getting a better entry and if price keeps going the wrong way, you’re risking less than your full 1%. 

Then when you get the confirmation going back in your direction, enter again, and when it breaks the high or low, enter one more. 

Congratulations, you now know how average down and to scale into any one of your stupid strategies to give you a better chance at obtaining an edge. 

Your guru is lying to you. Stop listening to them. They don’t know what they are talking about. You just don’t know enough to know how stupid they all sound.

1nri4d0,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 21:00:28,Winrate and ROI are meaningless,"Only fake gurus brag about it.

Capitalizing on edges when they present themselves is all about management of risk.

Whats wiser?

Risking 80% of your cash to make 30% 

Risking 20% of your cash to make 20%

Or risking 5% of your cash to make 10%.

Most people fall for the trap of thinking winrate and ROI mean something when they don’t. It’s how people sign up for services and suddenly they start to lose money. Or follow gurus who suddenly start to fall.

People do not know how to analyze risk.

So let’s look at some numbers.

Here are some stats from one of the funds I transparently show to the public.

Correlation to S&P - .511
Sharpe Ratio - 1.37
Sortino Ratio - 1.88
Beta - .46 
Alpha - .06

Lets breakdown what this shit means. I move with the market half the time. Depending who you ask that’s either a good or bad thing. 

Sharpe is a measurement of return for the risk deployed. Excellent would be 1.5. Mine sits pretty. Not the best. But it indicates I’m a decent performer. 

Sortino measures downside volatility. How effective one is when the market turns against the portfolio. 1.88 is fucking baller. My largest drawdown this year lasted for five days during the tariff shock in April. And even then it was just a theoretical loss as it stemmed from the extrinsic value skyrocketing during that time. Ended the month in profit. My lowest month this year was a loss of .1%. This is where I shine.

Beta measures my volatility against the stock market. Default is 1. Over 1 and you have wilder swings than the market. Lower than one means your less volatile then the market. Low beta could imply lower returns and high beta could imply higher risks. I’m consistently less volatile than the market as I prefer scalable and predictable outcomes.

Alpha measures how much better you’re expected to perform beyond the market given the risk deployed. I’m expected to beat expected performance given the risk by 6%. This implies my edge is institutional grade.

So when you summate it all it implies that my results will likely outperform the market on half the volatility that the market would provide with limited downside risk. 

I am over 20% for the year cumulatively and I’m currently compounding over 50% annual returns.  

Now… ROI has some meaning when you see the entire picture.

My winrate is 54.8% solely because I hedge and trade a lot of spreads. Because of the complexity of my trading it would be foolish to even consider winrate as a feature to brag about. When I’m trimming any spread almost always I’m cutting a loss and a winner at the same time. Generally the winner being more than the loser.

So when the guru starts bragging about his 90% winrate and 200% ROI, go look at the ridiculous risks it took to get there and see how it isn’t sustainable when you learn how to read and understand risk.

Demand transparency from anyone offering you any advice even if it’s free.

1nrg244,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 19:20:35,The sheer reality of gurus.,"In the business of finance, when you have an edge you want to leverage that edge. Meaning, for the same work that you do you want to keep doing that same work and you’ll exponentially grow. 

When you have an edge, it’s literally just a money printer at that point that can only end up printing more money. Nobody is going to sell that or give it away when you can profit immensely off of it.

Edges aren’t infinite. They are finite.

The market is ridiculously efficient. So efficient that you could think you have an edge for years just for the market to rip it away because of unforeseen risks you have no concept to mitigate. 

So, how gurus even come to be is that like you, they tried something. But they caught a winning variance. Like you, they want to show that off and be the next big top guru. They force themselves to take bigger risks or the already big risks they take get negated by the efficient frontier. 

They need money. They want the lifestyle. So they turn to sell the system that they used and got lucky on. They’ll only show you want they want to show you.

They’ll tell you that you have to learn for yourself. They’ll even tell you that signal services are garbage. 

And that’s true too. Most are trash. Nearly all our trash. Wait until my competing funds realize the AI bots they are implementing don’t work for shit when the market flips. Ya boy is gonna 10x again. 

These lying gurus have created an environment of bs on what it required to be profitable. You know this. You truly do. You’re not stupid. Well… the gamblers are. They’ll chase that dopamine to the ends of the earth. Thank god for them. Without stupid traders, winners wouldn’t have anyone to profit from. 

But to do what you’re attempting is lunacy. Maybe you can get there. Doubt it. 

But not the way you’re going about it. Your guru lied to you.

Stop blaming yourself for not getting it and start blaming the phonies who are lying to you. 

Rebel against it. Demand absolute proof. Not just of gurus. Of anyone giving you advice on trading.

Everyone wants to feel like the teacher when they should shut up and focus on being worthy to begin with. And in this game, trading.

It comes down to one thing and one thing only.

Shares are up 46.2% year-to-date, outperforming peers, though valuation now trades at a forward P/E of 38.4x. Despite momentum, investors face a reminder: VMware recently agreed to a [$102.5M securities settlement](https://11th.com/cases/vmware-investor-settlement), underscoring lingering governance concerns.

* Gross margin expanded 300 bps to 93% post-VMware integration.
* Operating margin surged to 77%, reflecting scale efficiencies.

Developments in AI are no joke in terms of a huge step towards leveling the playing field, and I believe every trader will have an AI assistant suggesting, a finance support chat bot on brokerages at the very least, which will then evolve in the very near future.  
  
I think my main goal here is to provide some context. I am not alone in this endeavor, and am working with two AI/ML data scientists/senior engineers. I used to work for a hedge fund, and the three of us all worked together at an AI startup where we realized that what we, and a ton of other 'AI startups' were doing wasn't even really using/a good use case for AI. Bubble material, fs. Them, having been interested in algorithmic trading/me having worked in the trading space myself made us all think about the obvious appeal of using RL/ML to craft a tool to take the tedium out of algorithmic strategy development. Having run through several iterations myself it is a major pain in the a\*\* to locate indicators/backtest/tweakparams/tadjust for risk/repeat.

It struck us that if we could execute and build a tool that truly leverages AI and works, that we could have a shot at giving more people like ourselves, or people who have been beaten down by the markets a better shot at creating a winning strategy. Not saying we are going to beat the market, just that we should all have access to something that makes it even just a little easier to maybe possibly start compounding risk-free profits like Jane Street.

The discouragement is super valid, and it's motivating! Not because I want to prove anyone wrong, I've got nothing to prove, but because I think anyone interested in leveraging AI to create an algorithmic trading strat should be able to, and if we can crack this maybe we have a shot at leveling the playing field even a little bit. Idk, I'm done ranting now, and will go back to building a tool for ya'll. Much love, and may your charts be green.

1nqyeoe,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 07:05:10,You’re losing because you don’t know when to take the right action.,"Your fake guru taught you it’s so simple. You can beat a trillion dollar a day market with just a simple strategy that you do over and over again. 

But when you look around, nobody is making any consistent money doing it. If you were forced to show your trading record in this group, nearly all of you are not profitable with an edge. 

Just seems that way because people only brag about their wins and never show their full transparency. Y’all bust nuts over funding certificates as if that means anything. 3% of people pass challenges, and of those 1% keep a funded account for a year or more. Wrap your head around that one. If you’re doing what everyone else is doing, how the fuck are you going to get into the top 1% of the top 3%?

The strategies you all have chosen are all various hedging tools that you’ve turned into a slot machine.

Each strategy is designed to be unique for the market you’re trading in.

Example. Let’s say earnings are coming up for NVDA. You’re long. Your market bias is long . But you’re concerned the market might move against you. You may have heard of lotto. But a real purpose for that would be to potentially catch the downside action if the stock were to just rip down. So you might buy a put lotto just in case. It’s cheap. And if you don’t want to pay for it, you can cover the upside with a deep OTM call and use those proceeds. 

Now you’re protected. Proper use of a lotto, and you don’t care if it loses, because it was only there to hedge.

Understand profit is made in hedging. You might have heard that the average hedge fund returns 7-8% a year. But what you don’t understand is that 7-8% came from virtually no risk because the markets were hedged. Wealth doesn’t care about doubling accounts. It cares about preservation of wealth.

Most of you will bust when the bear market hits and quit. Because you’re disillusioned by the idea that you think you have an edge but you don’t even want to learn about risk to reward. Listen. Your winrate don’t mean shit. Your ROÍ don’t mean shit.

What was the risk to get the reward. What was that risk in relation to the market where you can just buy and hold. Importantly, what’s your alpha? That’s your ability to profit from the market outside of market momentum. Example might be going long on a stock when the sector itself is crashing, yet you come out with a win.

I promise you, it’s not your psychology that’s failing you. It’s your lack of knowledge on how to trade the financial markets, and the non transparent FTC and SEC investigated influencers told you it was simple.

Well they wouldn’t get you to buy in if you knew absolutely how complex it is to make consistent income over years of time without having to resort to selling to others because you lacked an edge in the end.

You need an arsenal of weaponry, not some stupid set up you think is gonna change your life forever. Maybe, if you’re lucky. But luck isn’t reliable. And edge is. Learn how to read risk immediately or you you will never get to 2-3% monthly returns consistently.

1nqqzzc,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 23:32:49,Backtest results from a neural network,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a personal project I've been working on. This isn't a post to sell anything or promise crazy returns, but rather a showcase of a robust machine learning framework I've developed. The goal was to see if I could build a process that generates a real, verifiable edge, even under difficult market conditions.

For this test, I chose ETHUSD specifically because its price action was choppy and difficult for a significant portion of the backtest period. Here are the high-level results:

    ==================================================
     Results for: v1.9 Daily Model on ETHUSD
     Strategy: 'dynamic_threshold' (T+1 Pricing)
     Date Range: 2024-06-20 to 2025-01-01
    ==================================================
    Starting Capital: $1,000.00
    Ending Capital:   $2,065.49
    Total Return:     106.55%
    --------------------------------------------------
    Total Trades:     41
    Win Rate:         65.85%
    Profit Factor:    6.68
    Max Drawdown:     -8.17%
    ==================================================
    

Now, I know the first reaction to any backtest is skepticism, as it should be. Here are the three most important things about the methodology behind these numbers:

**1. This isn't just a one-off strategy; it's a generalizable framework.** The model's features are based on a proprietary method I developed called the TCXA framework, which models the underlying ""grammar"" of market structure. The same feature engineering and training pipeline that produced this ETH model gets similar results on every asset I've trained it on - BTC, ADA, DOGE. The system is a ""model factory,"" not a single, curve-fit strategy.  

**2. It's rigorously tested on out-of-sample data.** This is not a case of training and testing on adjacent data. The model used for this backtest was trained on data from **2016 through the end of 2023**. The test period you see above begins in **June 2024**, leaving a **6-month gap** of unseen data between training and testing. This is a crucial step to ensure the model has learned real patterns, not just memorized recent price action.  In other tests, I've trained form 2014-2018, tested for 2024 and still got results.  Not as good, but comparable.

**3. The backtest is realistic and free of lookahead bias.** This is the most important point. I've spent more time on the data integrity and MLOps pipeline than on the model itself.

* **No Lookahead:** I have verified that the features generated on historical data are **bit-for-bit identical** to the features the system generates in a live environment.  
* **Conservative T+1 Execution:** The backtest uses a pessimistic ""T+1"" fill model. This means the decision to trade is made at the close of one candle (T), but the trade is simulated as executing on the *next* candle (T+1). To account for slippage and market friction, all buys are filled at the **high** of that next candle, and all sells are filled at the **low**. This ensures the model's edge is strong enough to survive real-world execution conditions.

Here are the visuals for the test period:

**(Equity Curve)**

Using this system, I'm able to train models that predict at all sorts of different timeframes.  This is one of my longer term models - it predicts the return for the next 24 hours every hour.  I am in the process of developing one of these models to post automated trade signals for BTC/USD in real time through my X account, this model is meant to operate at a frequency that a person following it on X could realistically keep up with.  When it's ready I'll write a new post showing recent backtesting details for the specific model it's running.  Until then I'm happy to answer questions.

It’s got nothing to do with charts at all — it’s something in particular I look for, and I found a correlation between the successful ones and the ones that fail. Obviously, I didn’t crack the code, LOL.

But it could just be a dumb coincidence. However, I saw that I would need 1 win to cover 25–40 losses. I used the system and made a handsome return, not in money, but in percentage.

However, I feel skeptical. How do I know if the system I have is the system that’ll work in the future? I mean, unless it’s value investing, I see no other way to tell if the future is bright or not. I don’t want to just “dabble” for 40 years of my life. Any advice?

Even if I lose the next 20–30 times in a row, and one win comes out, who’s to say I’ll win 51 times? Maybe it’ll always stay at 50, and the losses will rack up.

1nqim2d,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 17:04:54,Crypto + Stocks in one place? Here’s my take on RUX,"One of the biggest pains in trading has always been switching between platforms. If you trade crypto and also dabble in stocks, you probably know the hassle: different apps, scattered funds, high spreads, KYC-heavy setups, and delays when you just want to get in and out of a position quickly.

I’ve been looking at how exchanges are trying to solve this, and RUX on Bitget caught my eye. It basically combines stocks and crypto under one roof, so instead of juggling broker accounts and crypto wallets, you can use USDT directly to trade things like NVDA, TSLA, or AAPL with leverage if you want.

It lowers the entry barrier too — instead of needing big capital, you can start with small amounts. And since it’s index-based, pricing feels more transparent compared to relying on a single source.

The idea of blending traditional assets with crypto tools (fast settlement, fractional trading, global access) could be a game-changer for traders who want flexibility without all the usual friction.

1nqij5e,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 17:01:37,"What Losing $72,000 Taught Me About Trading","

I don’t post this to flex or to get sympathy. I’m posting this because every trader at some point hits a wall, and for me that wall cost $72,117. Looking back at those trades, I learned more from that drawdown than from any winning streak I’ve ever had. If you’re in this game, I hope what I share here saves you time, money, and a few blown accounts.

1. Risk management isn’t a suggestion
When I dug into those losses, the biggest mistake wasn’t the setups themselves. It was that I had no consistent risk plan. Sometimes I’d risk $200, sometimes $2,000, depending on how “confident” I felt. Confidence is not risk management. Without a fixed risk per trade, every loss compounds unpredictably. The number that stood out most to me wasn’t the -$72K. It was the 13 consecutive losses. With proper risk sizing, that stretch should have been frustrating, not account-ending.

2. Losing streaks reveal the truth about your process.
It’s easy to feel like a genius when trades are going your way. You start to believe the market “makes sense” and you’ve got it figured out. A real losing streak exposes whether you have an actual system or if you’re just winging it. During those 13 red trades in a row, I realized I didn’t have a defined playbook. I had “ideas” and “feelings”  but nothing I could consistently execute. If you can’t clearly write down your setup, your entry/exit criteria, and your risk rules, you don’t have a strategy. You have hope.

3. The psychological spiral is real.
After a string of red trades, my instinct was to “make it back.” That’s when I started oversizing, taking lower-quality setups, and ignoring my stops. Every losing trader knows this spiral, but very few actually put systems in place to stop it. What I should have done was step away after 3 losses, reset, and review. Instead, I traded through it and bled out. Discipline isn’t about avoiding emotions, it’s about building rules that protect you from yourself when those emotions hit.

4. Journaling turns pain into progress.
The $72K wasn’t wasted because I documented every single one of those trades. I tracked context, entries, exits, and what was going through my head. Patterns became obvious: I was most reckless after 10:30 AM, I entered early instead of waiting for confirmation, and I risked more after a loss. Without journaling, I would’ve walked away with nothing but regret. With it, I built the foundation of my current process.

Losing money doesn’t make you a bad trader. Refusing to learn from it does. If you’re new, don’t wait until you’re $72,000 down to respect risk, build a playbook, and journal your execution. If you’ve already taken big losses, don’t waste them  extract every lesson you can and let the data, not your emotions, shape your next chapter.",175,46,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nqij5e/what_losing_72000_taught_me_about_trading/,new,Due-diligence,0.94
1nqhtn9,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 16:33:41,You are losing because you’re forcing something that isn’t for you.,"I’m not saying you can’t be the scalper you dream about being. But they are so rare that they are damn near mythical. 

Not the gurus you see, but real ones. They are out there but they are a different breed of person and they don’t have the capital constraints or feelings of money you possess.

If you are dealing with the psychological stresses of trading it’s because you are trading something you shouldn’t be doing.

Zoom out and scale out for the next 20 trades. Watch how your results magically improve.

You don’t have to worry about news, or gaps, or stop hunts, which you have all branded as liquidity sweeps, yet somehow deny that stop hunting isn’t real….. but anyways.

Most of you are better for swing trading or position trading.

You don’t get to join the NBA because you watched Jordan dunk. You don’t just get to succeed at the most highly leveraged variant of trading in the world simply because you think you need to lock in.

Your guru lied to you. 

Start with the basics. If you can’t make a profit in stocks you aren’t going to make a profit in any variation of a derivative of a stock.

All you will do is compound your losses. You should know. If you were honest and posted your last 90 days of trading you’d see the flaws.

And if you’re going to gamble with stocks, then there’s no hope for you at all. If you’re a gambler, stop trading and go back to the casino. Vegas is dying. ",16,21,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nqhtn9/you_are_losing_because_youre_forcing_something/,new,Discussion,0.67

1nqcf9f,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 13:07:18,10 Biggest Mistakes I Made My First Year (And How I Fixed Each One),"**An Autopsy of My First Year ( As requested by yall on my last post)**

My first year of trading was brutal. I thought I was going to get rich quick, but instead I stacked mistake after mistake. Looking back, that year and the 2nd was the most important part of my journey, because it forced me to learn the hard lessons that still guide me today and it helped me realize wehat syle and what markets fit me best!

Here are the 10 biggest mistakes I made and exactly how I fixed them:

1. Oversizing

I’d risk half my account on a single trade because I “knew” it was going to work. Of course, when it didn’t, I wiped out weeks of progress in seconds.

Fix: I committed to fixed risk per trade. Now I size everything in R multiples, win or lose, I know exactly what’s on the line. I styill have dynamic risk but its between 1-4% depending on the trade.

2. No stop losses

I used to believe I could “manage trades manually.” That always ended with me staring at a massive floating loss, hoping it would turn.

Fix: I set hard stops every trade. Even if it’s a painful stop out, it saves me from the catastrophic blowups. I sually tend to take reversals so I set my stop at the new high/low that was set.

3. Strategy hopping

Every week I’d be on YouTube chasing a new “holy grail” system. Supply and demand one week, moving averages the next, then order blocks, then RSI.

Fix: I picked one framework and committed to it for 6 months straight. Consistency of execution was more important than constantly chasing perfection. Backtested the hell out of it with a proper tool, nt just bar replay, then forward tested it.

4. Not journaling

I’d take 20 trades in a week and by Friday I couldn’t even remember half of them. There was no way to know if I was improving or just repeating mistakes.

Fix: I logged every trade, entry, stop, setup, and notes. Now I can look back and clearly see why a trade failed instead of guessing.

5. Trading when emotional

If I lost in the morning, I’d double size in the afternoon trying to make it back. If I was bored, I’d force trades just to “do something.”

Fix: I started tagging trades with emotions in my review. Over time, I noticed revenge trading patterns and cut them out. This was the hardest thing for me to beat. I would go on massive winning streaks but as soon as I had 2-3 lossed, I would go berzerk.

6. Chasing moves

I’d see a big candle rip and jump in late, only to get stopped out when price retraced. FOMO killed me more than bad setups or I would see my A+ setup playout for the day, then get pissed and chase some subpar trade.

Fix: I learned to mark levels ahead of time and wait for price to come to me. My best trades now feel “boring” because they’re planned hours in advance.

7. Ignoring time of day

I used to trade from open to close, thinking more screen time = more money. Instead, I just collected random losses.

Fix: By tracking trades by time, I saw most of my losses came between 8:30-10:30 PST. Now I avoid that window completely and focus on my profitable sessions.

8. No game plan

I’d wake up, open the chart, and hope something obvious would appear. Of course, that led to me forcing setups out of thin air.

Fix: I write a plan before every session with key levels, bullish/bearish scenarios, and triggers. If nothing lines up, I don’t trade and if I don't write a gameplan the day before or prte market, I also don't trade.

9. No weekly review

Every week bled into the next. I never connected the dots between what was working and what wasn’t. Half assing things DOES NOT work in dieting, training, trading or any aspect of life.

Fix: I do a weekend review where I group trades by setup, time, and outcome. That’s where the biggest breakthroughs come from, not daily PnL, but trends over time. I also spend time backtesting 1-2 week of data, every single week without missing a week for over 3 years now.

10. Expecting fast success

I thought I’d be consistent in 6 months. When it didn’t happen, I forced trades to “make up for lost time.” That mindset cost me more than any losing streak.

Fix: I accepted this is a 3-5 year or even longer game. Once I stopped rushing, I focused on the process instead of chasing quick wins. Do not put a time frame on this because that just adds more stress to you.

Trading will humble you. The key is letting those mistakes shape you instead of break you.

It’s what keeping you from being successful.

The psychological warfare is not just from trading. But rather the type of trading you are all trying to achieve. 

The real fight is in accepting that if you want to succeed you first have to get yourself into something that is lightweight and gives you the opportunity to learn about all of the stock market.

It’s not that you don’t want to learn complex option strategies. You just don’t have the time because you spend it glued to charts and backtesting systems that inherently have no edge.

The 3-5 years isn’t about you “locking in” on some wild ass trading. 

It’s about actually learning and growing and developing the proper system in place to take advantage of edges in the market when they appear.

You don’t like me personally. You don’t need to. Honestly, I don’t like you either. So who gives a shit. 

I do something none of your gurus do. Post my entire record. All transparent. And yet, because my returns are 2-3% monthly, you’ll reject that.

Listen.

The Medallion fund is the most legendary fund ever. It was able to gross 60% returns annually for decades. They did so much, that they closed off the fund to new money so they could just internally scale their own capital.

That comes out to about 4% monthly on average compounded. My returns put me easily in the top 10% of traders in the world. 

You doubling an account isn’t a real thing. It’s just a stupid risk. 

You’ve all forgotten compounding returns. You would rather chase the dopamine instead.

My education is free. There is no catch. The only catch is you and your limited belief system.

Two Chinese tech giants are standing out right now: **Alibaba** and **Baidu**.

**Alibaba (BABA)** has had a rough stretch, losing more than 76% at its worst. But this year it’s up \~94%. Its AI push is serious — the Qwen language models, big bets on AI chips and cloud infrastructure — all of it signals Alibaba isn’t just an e-commerce player anymore. At \~18.7× trailing P/E, it’s not expensive given what it's doing. Many investors might be underestimating how much upside is left.

**Baidu (BIDU)** has also been dragging for years, but it’s stirring now—up \~48% over the past month. Its valuation is low (\~12.4× trailing P/E). And with its “Ernie X1.1” reasoning model debuting, it’s directly competing with big names like GPT-5 and Gemini. Baidu has tons of data, which is a huge edge in AI.

Of course, Chinese stocks are volatile, and short-term moves can sting. But for longer game players with some risk tolerance, dipping a toe into Alibaba or Baidu now might pay off if China’s AI evolution continues.

I’ve been trading for about 5 years, mostly selling options, and it’s gone well, but I’m starting to think about how to push growth without just cranking up size on one setup. Curious if diversifying across a few different strategies actually smooths things out in practice, or if it just adds complexity without much benefit.

1npsxvf,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 20:40:09,The End of Diversification Again!The Market is Now a Barbell of State-Sanctioned Tech and Actual Rocks.,"​A few days back, we posted that the market is basically a SPAC for the National Security State. 

The reaction was... spirited. 😵 But the tape this week is screaming that this isn't a pessimistic take it's just the new structural reality. We've officially entered a two track market, and the AI rally just got a beautiful, violent reminder of this when the world's second biggest copper mine shut down and the physical metal went vertical. 

This is the new playbook: a barbell economy where the only things that seem to matter are the politically essential narratives on one side, and the physically-essential resources on the other.
​On one end of the barbell, you have the National Champs Nvidia isn't just investing $100B in OpenAI, it's funding a state sponsored Manhattan Project. 

Intel isn't just raising capital; it's passing the hat from Nvidia to Apple in a government blessed fundraising tour to create a domestic chip cartel. The value of these companies is now a function of political will as much as it is of earnings. 

On the other end, you have the physically scarce inputs this new industrial machine needs to run: copper, lithium, energy. Their value is a function of geology and physical logistics. The fascinating question is what this means for everything caught in the middle. 

Is this the new permanent structure of the market? And if so, is the only winning strategy to own both ends of the barbell and ignore everything else?

Let's brainstorm together

1. Minimize losses

You’ve probably heard that you should cut your losses, but the most important rule is to lose as little as possible. Keep your losses as small as you can.

Similar to a business, if you can keep your losses close to 0, it becomes “easy” to go from red to green.

2. Use a trailing stop

By using a trailing stop loss, you automate some of your risk and money management. The trailing stop also helps you achieve rule number 1, minimize losses!

3. Follow the trend

Trade with the trend, it is your friend. You’ve probably heard that as well, but it is true. Do not trade against the market, in the same way you shouldn’t swim against the flow of a river. Go with the flow, follow the trend. Find a good spot to enter and ride the wave.

4. Don’t try to time the market

If you could time the market, you’d be ultra rich. Instead of trying to time the market, follow your system, your rules and execute an entry or exit based on what your rules say.

5. Trade high probability setups

Wait for the high probability trade setups and only take those positions. Don’t gamble on noise, random setups. By taking high probability setups, it is much easier to turn a profit over time, while following the above rules of course.",13,9,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1npr28s/my_top_5_rules_that_improved_my_stock_trading/,new,Strategy,0.93

If you don’t remember, in 2020, VMware was accused of delaying sales order paperwork to push revenue into the next quarter, allegedly masking its true financial situation. When this came to light, $VMW stock dropped, and investors filed a lawsuit.

The good news is that $VMW settled $102.5M with investors and they’re accepting late claims. 

So here's all I know about this settlement:  

**Q. Who can claim this settlement?**

A. Anyone who purchased or otherwise acquired $VMW from August 24, 2018, to February 27, 2020.  

**Q. Do I need to sell/lose my shares to get this settlement?**

A. No, if you have purchased $VMW during the class period, you are eligible to participate.

**Q. How much money do I get per share?**

A. The estimated payout is $1.87 per share, but the final amount will depend on how many shareholders file claims.

**Q. How long does the payout process take?**

A. It typically takes 8 to 12 months after the claim deadline for payouts to be processed, depending on the court and settlement administration.

You can check if you are eligible and file a claim here: [https://11th.com/cases/vmware-investor-settlement](https://11th.com/cases/vmware-investor-settlement)",1,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1npiwoo/faq_for_getting_payment_on_vmware_1025m_investor/,new,General news,1.0

My approach was simple: watch the live trades they publish, mirror a small number of signals manually, and slowly scale exposure when comfortable. There were a few clear patterns:

* Short timeframe bots (like 1-15m) move fast and cost you in fees/slippage unless you're fully automated.
* Transparency matters – platforms that show trade histories and performance metrics are way easier to test.
* Even with a decent win rate, a handful of big losers will gut returns if risk management isn't solid

I didn't blindly copy everything – i cherry-picked trades/signals that made the most sense to me. I tried a couple of big names like trade ideas, trend spider, tickeron, and a few smaller platforms. Now i've ended up sticking with tickeron (it's not perfect and was a bit confusing at first, but their transparency and the ability to watch live trades/stats across hundreds of trading bots made the difference for me).

1np6lpb,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 04:18:53,AI = power Here’s why I think this isn’t hype but a load-growth super-cycle:,"The IEA says electricity use from data centers/AI/crypto was 460 TWh in 2022 and could top 1,000 TWh by 2026 (already >2×), with AI alone doubling by 2030 in its base case.  
  
The U.S. grid is racing to catch up: utility-scale batteries are set to more than double by end-2025 (30–37 GW), and developers are adding record gas capacity alongside renewables to keep data centers online.    
  
Who looks best positioned (my view):   
  
$CEG (largest U.S. nuclear fleet => 24/7 carbon-free baseload)  
  
$NEE (massive renewables + storage pipeline tied to hyperscalers)  
  
$BEP (inked a 10.5 GW global renewables deal with Microsoft)  
  
$FLNC (grid-scale storage integrator for firming), plus regulated utilities with robust interconnection footprints.

I want to sell all and cash in my profits as the position is now up over 100%. My question is should I wait a few minutes at open for the price to settle or should I just set a market sell order before prior to marker opening. I want to hold onto as much of that 80% gain as possible is there any downfalls to setting a market sell order prior to open ? Do I risk loosing some of those gains to increased market volatility?

I wrote random notes here and there, but never with consistency and definitely not in a way that made me a better trader.

I hand wrote evrything, highlighted and marked stuff, never had any data I needed accesable to me.



Now, journaling is my most important edge. This is exactly what my workflow looks like:



**What I log after every trade:**



Entry, exit, stop, and R multiple.



Setup type (was it A+, B, or just emotional?).



Time of day (NY open, lunch chop, etc.).



What I was feeling before/during/after.

**How I review each trade:**



I look at screenshots and ask: “Did price action confirm my idea, or did I force it?”



I tag trades by session and setup so I can see patterns in bulk. (Mistakes, Playbooks, Custom tags..)



https://preview.redd.it/3bvzk0e3k1rf1.png?width=361&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b4c8eb6a4f50dd5d2f85db89606a9288c1f9ade

I grade myself not just on win/loss but on execution. A “good loss” is still a win if I followed my process. That's how I always wrapo up my journal for the day, if I ened in green or red.

**How it’s helped me improve:**



I spotted that my worst trades always came between 8:30-10:30 PST and Asia session, so I just cut that window out.

https://preview.redd.it/9w5r7gbzj1rf1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=f842ca399160d51c15fc902c3caaa3d5ed583bb9

I learned I only needed 1-2 solid setups a day instead of chasing everything.



I built confidence, because I wasn’t trading based on vibes,  I had the data in front of me.





Journaling isn’t about writing more. It’s about writing the right things and reviewing them the right way. That’s where the growth happens.



What do you want to see next?



A) A full breakdown of my weekly review process.



B) A real trade example with my notes and what I learned.



C) How I use tags to find which setups actually make me money.

1np0zqv,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 22:46:09,coming to 3 years trading full time,"I am a swing trader. Holding a trade for few weeks. I trade stocks and futures.  
  
I had dabbled in trading part-time starting in 2015, but in 2021, something changed. I found the right path, and it became a total obsession. The next two years were about complete focus with thousands of hours glued to charts, internalizing my setups.  My trading is hugely influenced by Mark Minervini and his VCP pattern. That is still pretty much what I trade. 

I had been fortunate in my career (the Bay Area pays well) and had saved over a million dollars. When I decided to go full-time, I did it cautiously, allocating only 25% of my savings to trading capital.

My first full-time year, 2023, was a struggle for months. With my swing trading style, there are long periods where the market isn't giving me anything. Then, August came. I caught a monster trend and it felt like everything clicked into place. I ended the year up 100%.

The second year started strong, but then I did something profoundly stupid. I took on a tremendous amount of risk on a new instrument and it went sideways. It was my worst drawdown. That one mistake weighed heavy on me. For the most of the year, I was wrestling with self-doubt, failing to execute top setups. I ended the year up 8%, but I know that I'd thrown away at least a 30% year.

This year, I've done almost everything right. I've been disciplined and followed my process, and I'm up over 30%. But the mental struggle is constant. 

After just a few losses, I still wonder if I'll ever have a winning trade again.

This is a very hard profession. The way I trade, where I make the vast majority of my money in just a few weeks in an entire year, takes a huge mental toll. 

After a few string of losses, I still find it incredibly difficult to risk - 1-2% of my account - even on top setup. I hope I can get better at this.

The business of trading is simple.
Find trends, ride it till it ends.
Doesn’t matter what setup you use to enter, pick one, stick to that shit.
Cut losses the moment your idea is invalidated. 
Protect mental capital at all costs. Why would you sit around for days in the red. Just cut that shit and go on to live another day, stress free. You can always enter again.
Scale into winners, that’s how you make the big bucks. Gradual exposure to a winning trade, not by doubling down on a looser cuz you think it’s gonna bounce.

This business is always going to have an element of discretion and feel. Do what you can to add structure but learning to feel the market is not a science. It’s energy, it’s flow, it’s market sentiment. Add whatever technicals you want but you can’t pinpoint an abstract thing. BUT, you will fail without some kind of structure. So accept that paradox of the market. 

You will never know what is going to happen next. Do whatever analysis you want. Crunch all the numbers. Read all the news. But when you put on risk, expect that you will loose.

This shit takes time. It’s a skill. Clicking the button isn’t the skill, it’s everything behind the click. Any avg joe can make money once, but to make it consistently, through many market storms, is what makes someone a trader. When times are good, everyone makes money. But in the bad times, who keeps their winnings?

Ever since that FOMC when we saw the Fed has penciled in two more cuts for 2025, markets have been chugging away on that optimism. 

Gold has move over a 1000pips since that FOMC, SPX chugging away into the 6700s, and DXY holding a lot weaker into the 97s.

Someone who avoids ""fundamentals"" or ""news"" may be looking for reversals or tops thinking ""gold has gone up so much it must sell now"" but we have since chugged away into the 3800s now in the spot market.   
  
If you understood fundamentals, you would know Gold will continue to rip on that rate cut optimsim, so the only trade ideas you should be executing on, or at least the one with the higher probability is buys. Pullback - buy, continuation - buy.

1nos48l,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 16:15:49,3 years of trading: The brutal lessons I wish someone told me sooner,"I’ve been trading seriously for about 3 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up small accounts, overleveraged, revenge-traded, and gone through the cycle of overconfidence → humility → back to square one. I’m not a guru, I’m not here to sell you anything. I just want to share the lessons that actually stuck with me, because I wish I had internalized these from day one.

1. Risk management isn’t optional it’s survival

Everyone says “risk management matters” but you don’t really understand it until you blow up a few accounts. The truth is, you can have a 40–50% win rate and still be profitable if your winners are bigger than your losers. But if you don’t cap your risk per trade (1–2% of account size), you’re basically playing Russian roulette. One stubborn “this has to bounce” moment can erase months of progress.

2. The market doesn’t reward effort it rewards discipline

I used to believe that the harder I studied, the more setups I should be able to find. Wrong. Most days, there’s nothing worth trading. Some of my best weeks came from taking only 3–4 trades total. Sitting on your hands feels lazy at first, but the reality is: trading more doesn’t equal earning more. It usually equals bleeding more.

3. Overcomplication is a trap

In my first year, my charts looked like a Christmas tree: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci levels, you name it. I thought the “secret” was hidden in some magical indicator combination. After testing for months, I came back to basics: clean levels, volume, and price action. Most pros I’ve observed keep it shockingly simple because clutter breeds hesitation, and hesitation costs money.

4. Journaling turned me from “random clicking” into an actual trader

I resisted journaling for the longest time. Felt tedious. But when I finally did it, patterns jumped out: I overtraded after losses, I closed winners too early when I was scared, I took dumb setups when I was bored. None of that was visible on my P&L alone. Writing down the why behind each trade gave me brutal but necessary feedback.

5. Trading will expose your psychology faster than anything else

The market is the best mirror you’ll ever have. If you’re impatient in life, you’ll overtrade. If you’re stubborn, you’ll refuse to cut losers. If you’re greedy, you’ll size up too soon. I used to think trading was about charts now I know it’s mostly about emotional control. If you don’t fix your mindset, no strategy will save you.

6. You don’t need to “quit your job” to be a trader

This one took me a while. I used to idolize the idea of being a “full-time trader” with no other income. The truth ? Having a second income stream actually helps you trade better, because you’re not desperate for every single trade to pay your bills. Desperation makes you reckless. A job or side hustle gives you breathing room, which translates into better decisions.

7. Consistency > jackpots

My biggest trap was thinking I needed one massive trade to “make it.” The truth is, trading is about grinding out small, consistent gains while keeping losses tiny. A steady +$100 a day is infinitely more powerful (and sustainable) than swinging for +$1,000 and wiping out half your account.",759,111,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nos48l/3_years_of_trading_the_brutal_lessons_i_wish/,new,Advice,0.97

Curve-fitting, lucky streaks, or unusual market conditions can all distort the picture.

That’s why professional quants often use **Monte Carlo simulations**. Instead of relying on one equity curve, the strategy is tested thousands of times with randomized trade sequences, volatility shocks, and variations. The result isn’t a pretty curve – it’s a **range of possible futures**.

We built a tool that does exactly this:

* ✅ Run thousands of equity-curve variations
* ✅ Measure probability of drawdowns
* ✅ Estimate realistic return/risk expectations

1nolq6z,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 12:15:31,Why I Stopped Using Single Indicators (Multi-Confirmation Strategy Results),"After losing Money following RSI divergences blindly, I rebuilt my entire approach around multiple indicator confirmation. Turns out most retail traders fail because they act on ONE signal.

**The Problem with Single Indicators:**

* RSI shows ""oversold"" → price keeps falling
* MACD crossover → turns out to be noise
* Breakout confirmed → immediately reverses

**The Multi-Confirmation Framework I Use Now:**

**Layer 1: Momentum**

* RSI (14) + Stochastic (14,3,3)
* Both must align—no single momentum signal

**Layer 2: Trend**

* EMA crossover (9/21) + ADX > 25
* Confirms directional strength, filters sideways chop

**Layer 3: Volume**

* Volume > 20-day average + Volume Rate of Change
* No breakouts without volume backing

**Layer 4: Support/Resistance**

* Price action at key levels + Bollinger Bands
* Entry only near logical S/R zones

**The Magic: 3 out of 4 layers must confirm before I enter.**

**Real Example (RELIANCE - Aug 2024):**

* RSI + Stochastic both oversold ✓
* EMA crossover + ADX rising ✓
* Volume spike on bounce ✓
* Bounce from 200-day MA ✓
* Result: 12% gain in 3 weeks vs. 2% loss following RSI alone

**Backtested Results (500+ trades):**

* Win rate: 62% vs. 38% with single indicators
* Average R:R improved from 1:1.2 to 1:1.8
* Max consecutive losses dropped from 9 to 4

**Key Learning:** Markets are noisy. Multiple confirmations filter out 80% of false signals, leaving you with higher-probability setups.

The patience to wait for 3-4 confirmations is what separates profitable traders from the 95% who chase every signal.

One of the most overlooked skills in forex trading isn’t predicting the market — it’s staying consistent. Many traders jump from one strategy to another, chasing quick profits, but this often leads to frustration and losses.

Consistency means:

Following your trading plan every day, without skipping steps.

# WAIT!

**This post is a critique, not an attack. Actionable insights are provided**

This doesn't come from a place of ignorance. I don't debate what I don't know. This post is in good faith.

Many people choose to dismiss ICT as a ""fraud"", but let’s look into it together.

# The institutional story & why retail traders find it appealing

ICT, to most retail traders, is convincing; by design, it helps them feel reassured and in control; it subconsciously satisfies your psychological needs if you believe in the theory, which is desirable but not beneficial for most.

**This study shows that most humans are even willing to give up financial gain to feel in control.**

The value of control

Moritz Reis, Roland Pfister, Katharina A. Schwarz

I'm sure you can relate if you are a discretionary ICT trader or an ex-ICT trader; the **Ad-hoc reasoning** makes the trader feel like they know what’s happening in the market(s) they’re trading and why things have taken place, present and past. The **hindsight bias** is also brutal due to the excesssive number of entry methods provided.

**The need for control is innate in us; it's how we're wired as humans.**

The data snooping across multiple timeframes displayed by most discretionary ICT traders makes it conveniently harder to expose again, by design.

**ICT/SMC is convoluted and discretionary likely on purpose, making it difficult for people to refute. It often presents like a shared belief system, rather than a straight forward replicable framework.**

**The burden of proof** constantly gets shifted, and circular reasoning pops up. ICT is designed to feel underpinned by logic and complex, but it’s mostly a mixture of heuristics and untestable narratives.

# SMC theory goes against market fundamentals [2]

[MMXM](https://preview.redd.it/kn35ycivtwqf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=463f698e663f27bc13df5b312324e565dc85598c)

**ICT example of supposed ""Market Maker Behaviour""**

https://preview.redd.it/iu4w6gvwtwqf1.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cd2c95d0b0adc548350558e622feee45fad6482

**Realistic Market Maker Behaviour**

**Market makers rarely engineer large movements over several ticks because of inventory risk.**

**I have provided institutional-grade literature which explains this in-depth towards the end.**

Understand that i'm not saying “stop hunting” never happens; it’s just rare and misrepresented by trading gurus to an extreme point. An MM moving price by a point to “sweep” liquidity is not the same as an MM moving price by 10+ points to induce/sweep liquidity; it's far too risky for them to do that, with rare exceptions.  
Even a 10-point move on index futures is large for a market maker.

**Here is an example (Futures):**

Let's make the current price 20010.00 and the price in focus 20000.00. -10 handles.  
If a predictive HFT MM Algo anticipates they'll be 3000 contracts 10 handles / $10 away from the current price and the algo anticipates the market impact per handle to be 200, leaving a +1000 contract discrepancy if the price is met, they wouldn't commit the 2000 contracts to spike the price most of the time even though it's logical because the inventory risk accumulation or chance of adverse selection would be too high even if they spread it out.

**They could be stuck with -2000 contracts on the wrong side of the market and lose a lot of money; all it takes is for a different algorithm to match their flow to nullify their market impact completely.**

**Here's the nuance, though:** if the price was already trading at that point that's $10 away from the current price and their predictive model still supports the decision they could provide liquidity at 20000.00 but also influence the price to trigger the orders but only if close and highly probable. For example, if the price is at 20000.50, they could sell a couple of hundred to flush the final buyers to trigger the anticipated order flow.

**The point is it's extremely unlikely for Market makers to influence larger movements/spikes to tap into anticipated liquidity unless the level is extremely close to where price discovery is taking place already. So it's the other market participants trading towards that level; that's the true causation, not the MMs.**

Some ICT traders will win; an overwhelming majority will lose. Even if all PD Arrays were ""applied correctly"" & if everyone traded ICT the exact same way, they'd be market crowds that'd be faded and cause alpha decay if there was any edge to begin with.

Note: Alpha decay is when a strategy loses its edge from being well known and executed.

I'm sure small market crowds from ICT trading behaviour already exist and are occasionally arbitraged by algos due to margin/trade size used & retail popularity. Predictable crowd flow gets faded. It’s not a conspiracy; it’s an industry fact.

# I've seen ICT work for others, so it must work, right? [3]

**This is a survivorship bias classic.**

[Traders still have a chance to make money with losing strategies](https://preview.redd.it/0kh6l9d3uwqf1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=62aed3c72c6d66c05d2fa11ec21e5fa9910ae840)

**As you can see here traders can make money with unprofitable strategies not Break-even. unprofitable.**

Anecdotal examples ≠ viability. Anecdotes don't hold weight.

If blackjack is rigged against the player, how come some gamblers made millions in Vegas without card counting? Ex. Dana White

Because it's a numbers game, and it all averages out.

Most ICT traders are losing money just like most gamblers in Vegas. But the wins are what's displayed, not the guy who lost his house in 100 hands.

It's the same thing with trading poorly modelled ideas, like most discretionary applications of ICT.

A few outliers will always exist; anecdotes do not replace systematic evidence.

There are academic-grade papers showing even coin flips can have periods of profitability coincidentally.

[Much more variance in outcomes is shown with zero edge](https://preview.redd.it/o21y1mo8uwqf1.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=0513aa7bba6bbadff4ad2cd8673cde7d719a69e6)

Most ICT traders don't collect first-party data on rule-based strategies (executed mechanically or with discretion); this is their downfall.

Few are the exception.

# Analogy (going deeper) [3]

SMC is like a “science” that never gets a fair test. The post isn’t to provoke and upset it’s to educate it’s not opinion it’s based on facts and visual evidence.

**ICT deals with time series data (OHLC), so data science rules do apply, but ICT’s application of “his concepts” violates standard data analysis principles. Whilst still having the illusion of rigour**

Price discovers quotes; it doesn’t “deliver them”. You’re wasting your time with theory. Half of what ICT says about inefficiency is correct; unfortunately, the rest of it is noise.

E/EV is the average net return per trade ex 1:2 with a 50% winrate is 0.5R avg profit per trade. E.g. (-1+2-1+2)/4 = 0.5R avg gain

[ICT DISTILLATION TOWER \(Analogy\)](https://preview.redd.it/baekswfduwqf1.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=b711296a78dac92b4850cbbf61aa740a148e2a17)

Think of ICT like fractional distillation, but you have a range of temperatures where you can extract a substance instead of the specific temperature required. Only a loose guide. That’s similar to data snooping and the other data science flaws when applied.

The point is you might still get the substance you need from the distillation process but a lot of excess time and energy is wasted because you don’t apply the correct amount of heat, etc.

That’s how I feel about ICT concepts. Decent, unoriginal techniques, but there's a lot of noise during the application.

If you want to know how prices really work look at books and papers talking about **liquidity provision, price discovery** and **market auctions** for the truth.

# Definitions [4]:

Alpha Decay  
When a trading strategy loses its edge because too many people use it or the market adapts. Any advantage gets diluted or arbitraged away over time, especially when strategies are shared publicly.

Julien Penasse - Understanding alpha decay

Ad hoc reasoning is when someone makes up an explanation on the spot to justify or defend their belief or theory; typically, after the fact in an ICT context, it’s usually tied to hindsight bias.

Anecdotal Evidence

Personal stories or isolated examples. Common in retail (""I saw someone make $1M prop firm withdrawals using SMC!""), but not reliable proof of a strategy’s viability.

First-party Data

Data collected directly from a trader’s own trades. Backtests or forward tests; not taken from others' results or community anecdotes. As I’ve suggested, high-quality, first-party data is essential for knowing if a system actually has an edge. A Key marker for strategy substance.

Coin Flip Analogy  
Used in this to reveal that even completely random methods can appear profitable in the short term due to chance. Useful for exposing how randomness/noise can be mistaken for skill in financial markets.

Data Snooping (in trading)

Inconsistently looking at the same data (chart) multiple times over multiple timeframes and scenarios to justify a trade. Discretionary traders often do this to fish for “confluence” to validate their trading idea.

Burden of Proof

The responsibility to provide evidence for a claim. In trading especially, it should always fall on the person promoting a strategy, not the skeptic asking for proof it’s effective.

Hindsight Bias  
When a trader believes, after a trade’s outcome is known, that they would’ve known the result. Common in discretionary trading and journaling, where charts are reviewed after moves happen, making everything look obvious in retrospect, especially with ICT.

Survivorship Bias  
Focusing primarily on the positive events/wins while ignoring the majority of instances, which are negative. In trading, it's when people point to profitable traders using a method (typically baseless) without acknowledging how many used the same method and lost money.

Circular Reasoning  
The logical fallacy where the conclusion is included in the premise. In trading, a good example is saying a method works because it works, without solid evidence. Often shows up in unverified trading strategies. (no quality first-party data)

# Summary/TLDR Can ICT/SMC be salvaged and used?

Many of the ideas are weak, but VERY few take advantage of actual short-term market inefficiencies, so if you insist on using it, you must do high-quality first-party backtesting first, per setup, per instrument, which takes a lot of work. An overwhelming majority of ICT traders skip this; that's their downfall.

If you insist on using “ICT’s ideas”, which we don’t, just like anything, make sure you rigorously test it on every instrument you run individually without tweaks or curve fitting. Or you don’t know how effective it really is or if it has any edge at all. **Unfortunately, ICT shares the same structural weaknesses as many retail systems: heavy discretion in most applications, limited first-party testing and heightened potential exposure to alpha decay.**

[Real Backtesting Data Example](https://preview.redd.it/o57evfniuwqf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c2786e85d235e13de99e65115060c50c04c7f83)

If you're going to use ICT make purely mechanical trading strategies based on logic rather than narrative skip things like MMXM and focus on more basic setups like breakers, mitigation, fvg and so on and build from there. If you are going to do multiple timeframe analysis use the same timeframes in the same order, per setup for consistent execution priority and to prevent look-ahead bias.

1noh5ve,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 09:18:13,The harsh truths nobody tells you about trading,"Most people come into day trading with dreams of financial freedom, working from a laptop, and making thousands before lunch time. And i honestly don’t blame them.. that’s how it’s sold online. But the reality of day trading is a lot harsher than what you see here from /r/wallstreetbets screenshots. For those who are serious about this, i wanted to list some of the truths most people won’t tell you until you’ve already lost a ton of money. This is part of an ongoing education series on reddit, if you like write ups like these, follow my account for more.

1. Most people lose money (and keep losing).

It’s estimated that 80 to 90% of traders fail, and that stat is no joke. The market is a zero-sum game; your wins come from someone else’s losses, and when you’re new, you’re the one feeding the experienced players. No strategy, guru, or indicator will change the fact that you’re paying tuition to the market in the beginning.

The hard part isn’t just learning setups..  it’s surviving long enough to actually get good. And the majority never make it past that stage because they run out of money or burn out mentally before they develop any consistency.

2. It takes years, not months, to get consistent.

A lot of beginners think they’ll be profitable within 6 months if they just grind hard enough. The truth is it usually takes 2 to 3 years of daily effort before you can really call yourself consistent. That’s thousands of hours of screen time, journaling, reviewing trades, and slowly building emotional resilience.

If that sounds like too much, trading probably isn’t for you. This is more like learning a professional craft (surgery, law, engineering) than picking up a side hustle. If you treat it like a shortcut, you’ll blow up.

3. Trading is boring when done right.

The highlight reels on social media show explosive wins and big green days. What you don’t see is that consistent trading is painfully repetitive. You’re taking the same setups over and over, cutting losers quickly, and stacking small wins.

If you’re looking for excitement, you’ll force trades, gamble on hype stocks, and churn your account into dust. The truth is the boring traders are the ones still around after 5 years.

4. Your emotions are your biggest enemy.

Everyone thinks they’ll be calm and logical until they watch their P/L swing hundreds or thousands in seconds. Fear makes you sell winners too early, greed makes you hold losers too long, and ego makes you size up when you shouldn’t.

No book or strategy will fix this for you; you only learn by facing it. The sooner you realize trading is 80% psychology and 20% strategy, the sooner you’ll start working on the real skill set that matters.

5. You won’t get rich with a small account.

Turning $1k into $100k in a year makes for a great screenshot, but it’s not reality. A small account limits your options and magnifies your risk. Realistic growth is slow, and it compounds over time. If you’re starting with $1 to 2k, your first goal should be survival and skill-building, not quitting your job.

The harsh truth is trading for income requires a big enough account to absorb losses and still generate meaningful returns. You don’t have to start huge, but you do need realistic expectations about what’s possible.

**Bottom Line**

Day trading isn’t the glamorous, quick-money lifestyle most people think it is. It’s a grind, it’s boring when done right, and it takes years to develop the skills and mindset needed to survive. If you’re still reading this and it doesn’t scare you off, that’s a good sign... you might have the patience and discipline to actually stick it out. Follow me for my next post.

1nogcmt,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 08:43:10,How to get funded and stay funded.,"You have to minimize your risk.

You need to set your position size in accordance to the notional value of your account.

For a standard 50k prop account that’s pretty much one micro.

You have to trade multiple assets.

One instrument and one asset is t going to cut it. Simplicity is the first round of liquidity 

You need for them to be uncorrelated. 

Example MBT, MCL, MES, and MGC. 

Prop firms want you to fail. It’s how they keep making money. You actually know this. You don’t want to accept it. That’s the mentality they thrive on. Your irrational understanding of risk and your desire for continuous dopamine.

Perfect storm to bleed you dry.

Despite hedging to be a very viable means of trading, example going long term long on ES, you can take a short on MES. Two different trades, for one simple purpose. Effectively hedging to minimize losses. Banned by prop firms.

By trading multiple assets with a single micro each you’re keeping yourself in the game. 

Your stop. Way the fuck away from the noise. If your stop is anywhere near price action, you’re liquidity. Get out of your head that you want to intraday trade. That only makes sense if you’re hedging a larger portfolio. 

You have to swing trade. But with props you have to manage actively by getting out at the end of the day and getting back in. You lose that hour but the gaps wont matter anymore because you’re on a low risk.

But if you’re riding out the higher time frame, you can capture days of price movement. Each day if price improved your market bias, add another micro and move in your stop. That’s how you’ll get your convexity. Your initial risk is narrow but you can scale into winners. 

Rinse repeat. You won’t bust. You’ll always be in the game. The drawback is that it takes a couple months as you’re only going for 2-3 percent returns a month on average. That’s where the gamblers lose their mind. 

Part of the 3-5 year window to being a pro trader just isn’t on knowledge, but actually building up your account. Allow compounding nature to work in your favor. 

You can’t get there on high risk. 

Chart on the daily, trade on the 15 minute. Set and forget. Repeat the next trading day. Generally between four to six assets you’ll have an opportunity to trade to satisfy the requirements of the prop firm. And since you’re closing out positions daily, you won’t need to worry about consistency rules. Your big win isn’t in a single day, but in a series of trades over the duration of the macro trend.

Attached is Silver ETF (SLV) monthly chart; for your information, SLV per share is slightly cheaper than spot per ounce (about $3 less), please do your addition when converting to spot.

The price movement of SLV, starts to show some stunning similarities to 2011 peak. In 2011 frenzy, silver broke out the rising channel (dotted line), then fell back hard for the next 5-10 years. This is 2025, another similar rising channel also formed, and we're rapidly approaching the breakout point AGAIN.

Is 2026 going to be a replay of 2011? well, it depends on the trading volume. At 2011's blow-off top, volume surged to crazy levels; we have NOT seen it yet. However by looking into the chart, I am worried it's gonna be a deja vu.

It took me a 5000 dollar course to realize 5 years ago, that the market INDUCES you to take position, then gives you a few pips to boost your ego and confidence, only to then reverse against you REALLY hard, not giving you a chance to pull out. This is one of the many reasons why risk management is CRUCIAL.

Whether you're using ICT, Elliot Waves, EMAs, Stochastic, or Bollinger bands or WHATEVER method, the market will trigger your setup and excite you to enter only to screw you. If they're showing you a Bollinger buy entry, they're showing someone else an Elliot Wave sell entry. Then the market triggers your stops on BOTH sides before ultimately going in whichever direction it wants to go.

You gamble.

You lose.

Any viable strategy needed to survive the markets is entirely negated by the way you engage prop firms.

You just don’t really need to trade everyday on the same asset with the same instrument. And you shouldn’t. 

You trade MES to hedge the delta against your portfolio when the market takes a sharp turn. Or perhaps to amplify delta if it’s lagging and the market is moving stronger than your bias.

In that one process you’re not trading everyday. You’re trading when needed and for some, it may be a perpetual hold to manage the granularity of their portfolio.

Y’all overleveraged on account sizes as well. Nobody should be trading NQ or any mini. You just don’t have the account size for it.

Most of you could probably survive a lot longer if you just traded one micro. Instead you’re just busting out accounts left and right. That’s not the type of trading any firm wants.

They let you gamble high risks and you do.

If there was a prop firm that only let you trade a single micro for every $50k they would not get any business. Despite that being the way to trade. 

Part of the 3-5 year journey isn’t just in the learning how to trade. It’s in building up your account and allowing compounding earnings generate massive results.

But no. That’s too far away. Trading has turned into just a casino. 

I’ll follow up in the next post on what you should do to pass these prop firms to get funded and to stay funded.

1no8jez,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 00:57:02,Is This Solid Journaling?,"Just getting into trading and just focusing on paper trading for a while. I have a simple strategy I came up with that is a rendition of Tori Trade's strategy. If you aren't familiar, she draws trend lines top down and then sees which way it breaks. I'm basically doing that, but adding simple price action layers on top like noticing support and resistance as well. I also trade the 5 minute and jump down to the 1 minute to look for a couple candlestick patterns. I only have the engulfing and marubozu patterns ""learned"" (recognizable). Again, I am just starting so just keeping it super simple with price action, plus the 1 minute chart doesn't really hold a lot of weight with candlestick patterns I feel like, especially because almost every candle is probably a pattern at that time frame. So really I am just taking the trade even if I do not recognize an entry candle pattern when it closes past a trend line.

It may not be the best strategy in the world, but I feel like I am learning. I got an interest in trading about a week and a half ago or so, and I have been consuming a bunch of content until I stumbled upon Tori and it just clicked for me.

Anyways, just looking to see if there is anything else I should add to my trade logs. I wanna actually try to learn this. So, if there are any additional things I should be journaling, please let me know, and remember I just want to keep it simple.

Edit: and I just started, so don't be too rough. The trade values take a jump, because I discovered prop firms. I decided once I get comfortable to the point of using real money, in several months, I would much rather spend $200 to try my shot at getting access to a 50k account. Even though there are strict rules. So, I reset my account as well to adjust for practicing for that. I am still taking it as serious as possible though.

Good morning fellow devotees of the Bloomberg Terminal. 

Today, it would appear that the market isn’t just a market... but a geopolitical fanfic where NVIDIA drops $100 billion! yes, a number usually reserved for small wars or large moons into OpenAI to build an AI infrastructure so vast it’s basically a digital Vatican for the machine god. (It's nice to see them spending their war chest of late isn't it?)

IMHO this isn’t investing; it’s a corporate power grab that could fund clean water for the planet (or my latest online horse betting venture) but instead screams, We’ll out-compute the world! 

The market, ever the enabler, sent NVIDIA’s stock to the moon, because nothing says bullish like betting on a friendly Skynet. Meanwhile, Oracle’s been tapped as TikTok’s algorithm babysitter, a move so drenched in Langley vibes it might as well come with a trench coat and sunglasses. And let’s not overlook the Fed’s newest governor, Stephen Miran, openly stumping for rate cuts like he’s auditioning for a cabinet post, while gold and the S&P 500 hold hands at all-time highs like they’re in a buddy cop movie. 

This isn’t trading at all like we have been saying for the last few weeks, it’s conscription into a centrally planned bull market where every ticker salutes the flag. Long gold miners (GDX) for the chaos hedge, Oracle (ORCL) for its new role as national security mascot, or fade that Baby Shark IPO for the lolz....pick your side in this glorious mess, because we’re all industrial policy quants now. Thoughts?

Oh, and the scorecard for those hating of late. my long Intel call from last week is printing like a laser thanks to that rival bailout, the SMH/KWEB pairs trade is still a geopolitical cash machine, and the leveraged steepener’s biding its time for the yield curve to wake up.(the recent move has helped)

For the YOLO crowd, shorting Baby Shark post pop or buying Argentine bonds on the Treasury’s “we got you” vibe could be quick wins. 

Let’s argue about it in the comments am I a genius or just yelling at clouds? (Hello.. anyone in there)

Traditional indicators work great... until they don't. RSI, MACD, moving averages—they all lag because they're reactive. By the time your charts show a bear market has started, you've already lost 15-20%.

The real game-changer? **Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for regime detection.** These AI models don't just analyze price—they identify the *underlying market state* in real-time.

Here's what I've learned:

* Markets aren't random—they follow distinct ""regimes"" (bull, bear, sideways)
* Each regime has different volatility patterns and price behaviors
* HMM can detect regime shifts 2-3 weeks before traditional indicators
* Combining this with sentiment analysis from news/social data = powerful edge

Example: In March 2020, HMM models flagged the regime change to ""high volatility bear"" 12 days before most technical indicators caught up. That's the difference between protecting capital and watching it evaporate.

Been backtesting strategies that adapt based on detected regimes rather than fixed rules. The results are eye-opening—14% higher win rates and 18% lower max drawdown compared to static approaches.

Anyone else experimenting with regime-aware trading? The math behind market microstructure is wild once you dig into it.*.*",0,14,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nnycjg/why_most_retail_traders_fail_to_spot_market/,new,Technical analysis,0.5

We've also had conversations with several traders who are deep into backtesting who have complained about feeling burnt-out, fatigued, low energy, and an inability to push through their work.

I’ve just started forex trading and I’m currently in my second week on a demo account. So far, what I feel is that trading is 90% psychology/instincts and only about 10% technicals (charts, indicators, etc.).

A trader I know told me a simple rule: “always buy when it’s a buyer’s market and always sell when it’s a seller’s market” – and surprisingly, that approach has been working for me.

Here’s how I trade right now:

I always use TP, but I don’t place a SL (and so far it has worked for me).

I treat this demo as if it’s real money – I take the same pressure I would on a live account.

Even though the demo balance is $3k, I consider it more like $100–200 in my mind to keep myself grounded.

After two weeks, my success rate is around 97%.

I know this is still very early and demo trading isn’t the same as real trading, but I’d love to hear from you guys:

What should I do further before switching to a live account?
Any habits, strategies, or mindsets I should build at this stage to prepare myself?

I only traded in these because I didn't want to get liquidated by a huge volatility in market out of nowhere. My capital was 80$.... A pretty small one you could say. In the first few days I traded I made some profit and losses but overall my capital reached 130$.... I was happy with it and was planning how I would have 500$ by the end if this month and in process like this I would probably be having 7-8k before the end if this year.... Unfortunately dreams are just dreams, I was using 100% of my capital and with a 10x leverage so I could make like 10-15% a day. But I didn't put stop loss at all because I thought why I need I am playing in choppy market and so I didn't put it up and I accidentally fall asleep one night when my trade was active and by the morning I woke up, instead of feeling the bitter taste of coffee..... I felt the bitter taste of sleeping so peacefully.... I lost about 70 dollars in just one trade from then on I thought I would close my trade whenever the price rich 20% of my capital in loss and I followed it for a couple of times and was in a loss and profit face but I was seeing that the price bounces back just after I take exit in loss, it's like market was just after me..... Sigh I am still thinking like that. Anyways it led me to believe I should remove it since price bounces back so I didn't put it up and this led to  a trade on 40% loss but since it was a weekend and crypto goes down so I did hold it for the weekend and just today the trade and crypto market suddenly dropped so much and I completely got liquidated, at the end of time I closed my 50% trade thinking I saved some capital but forgot that the trade was on cross mode and not in isolated so I lost completely because the sharp drop today was something I haven't seen since I started trading..... I have made some huge mistakes but they were worth it to make me learn something, I always thought lossing money just feels like heartache but it also feels like a teaching fees..... Now I am thinking that I should paper trade for a week, my strategy is that I should only invest 10% of my capital and risk it entirely either I am gonna win 10% more or loss that for the day and stop trading that day so I am only loosing 10% a day and my strategy will work but only in a choppy market I should avoid during high volume hours and should just stick with scalping and not just get liquidated my Entire capital....

Here are the main things I’ve learned about building strategies that actually survive:

1. **Start with real market logic** – momentum, mean reversion, trend trading. Don’t base it on random indicators or patterns without context. If there’s no logic behind why it should work, it won’t last.
2. **Define rules with zero subjectivity** – if you can’t code it into exact conditions, it’s not a real strategy. No “the market looks bullish.” Only measurable, rule-based setups.
3. **Backtest properly** – 10+ years of data across multiple pairs and environments. Short tests are misleading.
4. **Out-of-sample testing** – use untouched data to confirm the edge isn’t just curve-fitting.
5. **Robustness checks** – Monte Carlo simulations, parameter sensitivity, etc. If small changes destroy the results, it’s not stable.
6. **Forward test on demo** – confirm the system behaves in real markets before going live.

When a strategy goes through this process, it’s far more likely to stay profitable instead of collapsing after a few months.",3,12,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nnhg37/how_i_build_trading_strategies_that_remain/,new,Discussion,0.72

I’ve been running a rule-based commodity trading system (inspired by Turtle principles + my own execution rules), focused mainly on **Gold and Silver**. I track results rigorously using a *dynamic benchmark* — meaning I only count outperformance if my portfolio beats the **strongest benchmark (Nifty / Gold / Silver)** for that month. That way I measure true alpha, not just lucky comparisons.

Here’s the summary so far:

**Since Inception (Jul–Sep 2025)**

* **Portfolio PnL**: +62.78%
* **Best Benchmark (Silver, Jul–Sep)**: +22.15%
* **Outperformance vs Best Benchmark**: +40.63%

**Monthly Breakdown**

* **Jul ’25** → +10.84% (vs best benchmark +3.46%) → **+7.38% true alpha**
* **Aug ’25** → +15.39% (vs best benchmark +9.46%) → **+5.93% true alpha**
* **Sep ’25** → +36.56% (vs best benchmark +7.86%) → **+28.70% true alpha**

I have two versions of it (one for uptrends and one for downtrends), which are essentially the opposite of each other. I have a checklist that involves going through the weekly to 4-hourly timeframes, utilizing RSI, SMAs, MACD, and support/resistance areas. I have it written in third person as that helps make the rules clearer for me and stops me from reasoning as to when one can be slightly broken. I have also been testing it across the 7 main USD pairs to increase the likelihood of my setup appearing.

I'll paste it below, but just wanted some advice from those more experienced than me. cheers.

this is for the downtrend strategy:

**1.       Weekly**

·       On the weekly chart, confirm price is below the 50-SMA and 200-SMA, with 50-SMA below 200-SMA.

·       RSI < 50 to confirm bearish momentum.

 **2.       Daily Trend**

·       Ensure price remains below both 50-SMA and 200-SMA, with 50-SMA below 200-SMA (death cross).

·       Check that RSI < 50 and MACD line is below the signal line (bearish confirmation).

 **3.       Daily Rally**

·       On the daily chart, look for a temporary bounce toward the 50-SMA.

·       Ensure RSI rises to 50-60 (not overbought >70).

**4.       4-hour**

·       Look for price rejecting off the 50-SMA with a bearish candlestick and a MACD bearish crossover (MACD line crosses below signal line).

·       Ensure RSI is in the 50-60 range to avoid oversold entry.

·       Place SL above the recent swing high.

·       Set TP at the next support level or min. 2x SL distance for a 1:2 risk-reward ratio (if no clear support level).",1,3,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nnbcpq/dealing_with_no_setups/,new,Question,1.0

1nmx0to,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 12:50:01,5 Years In: The Advice I Wish Someone Gave Me On Day One,"I’ve been trading full-time for  2 years, started trading 5 years ago. Along the way, I’ve blown accounts, passed and lost prop firm challenges, had incredible months, and then been humbled the very next week. I primarily trade futures and stocks, but these lessons apply no matter what market you’re in.



1) Fewer Trades, Better Trades

My worst periods came from feeling like I needed to be in the market constantly. The reality is that most price action is just noise, or at least noise to YOU. The edge shows up only a handful of times each week. My best months came from taking fewer than 20 trades and letting the rest pass.



2) Keep Your Playbook Simple

When I started, my charts looked like Times Square, indicators stacked everywhere. That only led to hesitation and confusion. What finally worked was cutting it all down to a short, boring playbook: clean levels, liquidity cues, structure, and a couple of repeatable entries. Same markets, same times, same setups. Very very boring, which is good in the markets.



3) Risk First, Always

Every account I destroyed had the same cause: I ignored risk and moved stops, oversized or tried to “let it work.” Now I define my maximum loss per trade and per day. I place my stop where the trade is invalid and respect it. Capital is ammunition, you only get so much. Don’t waste it trying to prove you’re right. Also one of the reasons I could not make it in options trading is because yyou just never know the exact amount you can make.



4) Journaling Is Where Growth Happens

I used to think bad days were random. Journaling proved otherwise. When I started logging my trades with context, entry, exit, and emotions, patterns became obvious. I was revenge trading after losses, taking boredom trades late in the morning, and cutting winners during news. Writing it down forced me to face the truth and improve. I started with manual journaling but then moved to software years later because when you just write down stuff in your notebook, its really hard for the stats or the lessons you need to see to be availble to you quickly.



5) Protect Your Headspace

Trading money you can’t afford to lose is a fast way to ruin both your account and your mental health. If your rent or grocery money is on the line, you will cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and chase bad setups. Trade small, separate trading capital from living expenses, and make sure red days don’t control your mood for 24 hours.



6) Screen Time Beats Guru Time

Videos and books can teach you the basics, but real progress comes from watching price move in real time, replaying sessions, and backtesting your setups. Intuition isn’t luck, it’s thousands of hours of screen time.



7) Base Hits Beat Home Runs

Chasing the one big trade is what ruined me early on. Consistency is what built my account. A steady $200-300 a day compounds into far more than swinging for $5K and blowing up when you’re wrong. The small, repeatable wins are what keep you in the game long enough to scale. I started with making $20-40 a day or a trade I should say, and slowly sizing up, then gaining more capital and copy tading these smaller trades accross plenty accounts.



Bottom Line

Trading isn’t about finding a secret strategy. It’s about building a clear playbook, respecting risk, journaling your execution, and protecting your mindset. Once you do those things consistently, confidence stops being a feeling and becomes a fact backed by your data.



I’d like to continue doing write-ups like this if it helps the community. For my next post, I can go deeper into:



A) My exact journaling and review workflow (what I log, how I review, and how it’s helped me improve)

B) An autopsy of my first year, the 10 biggest mistakes I made and how I fixed each one

1nmwrsi,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 12:40:09,5 daily habits that move traders toward success,"Working with traders every day, I’ve noticed something interesting: the traders who eventually find consistency don’t always have the “flashiest” strategies, but they almost always build solid habits around their trading.

A few that stand out to me:

* **Sticking to risk limits** no matter what. It sounds basic, but it’s often the difference between blowing up and surviving long enough to grow.
* **Journaling trades** \- not just P/L, but documenting the *why* behind each entry and exit.
* **Routine** \- treating trading like a job, not a gamble. Having set hours, prepping before the session, and reviewing after.
* **Patience** \- waiting for high-quality setups instead of forcing trades.
* **Emotional control** \- being okay with losses, and not letting wins make you reckless.

From what I’ve seen, these habits tend to separate the traders who last from those who burn out quickly.

1nmsmso,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 09:56:16,Integrate day trade with job hunt? Looking for peers and advice,"**Purpose of this post**

I’m writing this post to have your view on my rationale and progress for day trading. I’m also looking for those who have a sustainable passion for day-trading, and ideally we can discuss strategies, share results, and even land a friendship. 

**Background**

* I’m a final-year student studying Finance and Machine Learning. My career interests are in asset management and markets, and I spend time every day reading news surrounding US commodity and equity markets. 
* Earlier this year, I finished my risk management internship at Macquarie (Australia’s well-known IB), but I didn’t receive a grad offer. Since then, I’ve been applying to pretty much every internship I can find related to asset management and markets. I managed to land a few interviews at Citi, GS, NAB, etc., but unfortunately didn’t get any offers.

I’m grateful that I managed to land a few interviews at prestigious firms, given Australia’s extremely saturated labor market. To give you an idea: NAB told us during the assessment centre that there were around 5,000 applications for their market internship role, and last year only 4 offers were given (you’d be surprised to find candidates at final stages that do not have 2+ internship experiences and equivalent to perfect GPA etc). Most mainstream internship applications are closed now, so I’ve started shifting my strategy to cold-emailing people on LinkedIn to see if there are any open spots.

**Rationale for Day Trading**

I have to say, the process of grinding through hundreds of online assessments, AI interviews, and waiting endlessly for outcomes is unhealthy. A few past colleagues and friends I catched up with agreed that it’s a fantasy to simply say and shift your mindset away when you’ve already invested hours or days into an application. The general consensus is that you find something intellectually challenging, so you’re not stuck worrying about things you can’t control. Some of my friends picked up swing trading or got serious about tennis, but for me, I wanted to know more about day trading.

**Why do I find myself suitable?**

* With application rounds near end and a reasonable coursework, I can consistently and currently put 3 hours purely for day-trading.
* I do not expect to put any capital until SIM proves consistent profits so there'd be no material losses on top of job rejections. My objective is to learn day trade as it's always been a huge interest for me.
* Although day-trading does not greatly depend on analyzing markets and company fundamentals, learning day trade provides great opportunity to learn the fundamental structure of a market and how orders, liquidity, volatility plays a role in influencing price actions. This is something that is intellectually challenging and aligns with my career interest.
* I personally don't think majors itself play a strong edge for day-trading but I've learnt to be patient, resilient and adaptive from my studies. At least I can claim that my majors have no negative impact for day trading.
* Yes I live in Sydney so market opens at 11:30 pm my time but I've managed to find a schedule that suits my life style.

**Current Progress**

I appreciate anyone who’s made it this far. The first thing I did when I started learning day trading was read *How to Day Trade for a Living* by Andrew Aziz, which really confirmed for me that consistency + passion > long hours + money-driven. Now I’m halfway through his second book, *Advanced Techniques for Day Trading*, and completed their lessons on psychology. I enjoy their live day trading sessions too, where you actually get to see how professional day traders (yes even Andrew himself) operate in real time and how they deal with psychological challenges in line with what’s written in their books, e.g., accepting losses like a chad.

I’ve also started using SIM on TradingView to get a feel for trade executions, and I’ve been journaling my trades and reflecting on them (attached a pic for reference). Right now, I’m committed to sticking with ONE or TWO strategies that I feel are most aligned with market logic and price action. I don’t really buy into fancy chart patterns (e.g. three white soldiers) that don’t have a solid root in market theory or psychology behavior but feel free to prove me wrong.

I’ve also attached a screenshot that shows my trade goals, how I define my trade book, and the rules I’m working with. They’re definitely still under progress, but feel free to take a look and drop any comments.

**Just one last bit**

Hopefully there’ll be some comments. I’ve purposely avoided going into too much detail to not bog people down. Instead, I’ll put more focus into building conversations with (all) comments and thus share more if necessary. If you'd just like to know more about me, just drop a comment and I’ll shoot you my LinkedIn pfp.

1nmquzi,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 08:38:11,The Future of Trading,"I believe we are in the midst of a significant paradigm shift in trading. I have been looking at more advanced trading strategies and I began researching Jim Simons.  He is one, if not the, most successful traders of all time.  He was years ahead of his time.  He trained scientists to trade and didn’t hire people from the financial community.  Same with Richard Dennis and Turtle traders. The point is, Simons hired the most brilliant minds in the world from meteorology to Applied Discrete Mathematics. Here is a summary of his work I asked AI to write. 

Jim Simons ran Renaissance’s Medallion as a data-driven, market-neutral, short-term statistical-arbitrage machine: clean huge datasets, find many tiny repeatable patterns with math and ML, trade across thousands of instruments, combine hundreds of small signals, hedge out broad market risk, size positions by expected edge and how they move together, cut losing signals fast, and crush costs and slippage with world-class execution. In that setup, trading—signal aggregation, portfolio construction, execution quality, and risk/cost control—mattered far more than classic stock selection; the specific names were mostly “carriers” for micro-patterns, while profits came from many small, fast, well-hedged bets executed with precision. 

He returned 66% annualized return over his career.  I began to reason we have access to this knowledge at our finger tips now with AI. Trading will change, whether we change with it or not.  If you consider we are on the front end, finally with traction in crypto, AI, quantum, the resurgence of nuclear, Robotics, etc., the future market looks like the beginning of a bull run which could run ahead of tech development and implementation. I think we are going to have to adjust and develop new metrics.  Jobs will be lost on the front end as jobs are developed to service and manage data centers, EV robotaxis, drones, nuclear facilities and more.  My point to all of this is, algos and HFT’s are already here.  Retail traders must find an edge.  This lies in not just learning the smoke and mirrors ICT program but, how to trade along side the institutions and compete.  Start thinking outside the box.  Constructive Thoughts?

You can consistently do the wrong thing every single day. That doesn’t make it profitable, it just makes you consistent.

The truth is if your system doesn’t have an edge, then all the discipline in the world won’t save you. Discipline only amplifies what’s already there. If you’ve got a negative expectancy, discipline just makes you bleed out slower and more reliably.

I see a lot of traders saying they just need to “lock in” or “be more consistent” and that’s why they’re losing. No. Most of the time the reason they’re losing is because the way they trade has no edge in the first place. You can be a consistent loser. In fact, most traders are.

Discipline matters, but it only matters after you actually have something worth being disciplined about. Otherwise you’re just marching in circles while the market takes your money.",32,38,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nmgobv/discipline_edge/,new,Discussion,0.85

I've noticed with respect to key levels (premarket high/low, yesterday high/low) I can sometimes see it lead SPY by a few 5min candles.

Background : I lost my job in February. Early 60s so I figured, rather than go back to the labor market, I'd transition to trading full time. And when people asked what I was going to do, I said. 

I started during covid, like many, so had been through the learning curve. But this year was, obviously, more intense and I'm finally pulling ahead in the black. 

So this friend, who is normally a wonderful person, a few weeks ago dropped a text bomb that they want me to come over to their house and help them pick a few stocks. Later I them I told them I couldn't, for the same reason I wouldn't tell them how to spend their money in any other situation, and they dropped it. 

Now, they're asking again. I just said to look at data.

1nm2lej,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 12:25:25,Here's a realistic breakdown of what it actually takes to become a consistent trader,"Ive noticed most people get into day trading because they see screenshots of $5k, $10k, $50k days and think it’s a quick path to freedom. I’ll be straight with you guys, that’s the marketing version of trading. Please don't buy into it. The reality is much less glamorous, and if you don’t know what it really takes, you’re going to burn out fast. After 5 years in this game, i wanted to do a little write up on my honest breakdown of what consistency actually looks like. This is Part 3 of my education series here, follow if you want more.

1. Time commitment is way more than you expect.

Trading isn’t just 9:30am to 4pm. Real consistency comes from hours outside market time: premarket prep, journaling, reviewing trades, building watchlists, studying setups, and putting in screen time. Early on, I easily spent 40 to 60 hours a week between live trading and studying. If you treat this like a hobby, you’ll get hobby-level results.

And it’s not just the hours, it’s the years. Consistency doesn’t come in 6 months, or even a year for most people. You’re rewiring how you think about money, risk, and decision-making under pressure. Expect it to take 2 or 3 years of real effort before you’re truly stable.

2. Risk management is non-negotiable.

I know everyone hears this, but most beginners still ignore it. Consistency doesn’t mean you never lose... it means your losses are small and controlled while your winners are slightly bigger. That balance, over hundreds of trades, is what keeps you profitable.

I don’t care if you’ve got the best setup in the world; if you’re risking half your account on one trade, you’re gambling. True consistency comes from risking small, living to fight another day, and never letting one trade or one day define you.

3. Discipline beats strategy.

Every new trader is obsessed with finding the “perfect” strategy. They’ll cycle through indicators, patterns, and systems, convinced the answer is out there somewhere. The truth? Most basic strategies work if you follow them with discipline. Most traders fail not because of their system, but because they don’t stick to it.

Consistency is boring. It’s showing up, following the same rules, and resisting the urge to deviate because of greed or fear. If you can’t execute a simple plan consistently, no “advanced” strategy will save you.

4. You need emotional resilience.

Day trading will mess with your head. You’re going to lose money. You’re going to question if you’re cut out for this. You’re going to watch your P/L swing in seconds and feel emotions you didn’t know you had. The people who survive aren’t the ones who avoid that... they’re the ones who learn to handle it.

Emotional resilience means not tying your identity to your results. It means accepting red days without revenge trading. It means staying calm when you’re up big and not blowing it all chasing more. Without that mental toughness, you’ll self-destruct.

5. You have to treat it like a business.

This isn’t a game. If you’re serious about consistency, you have to approach trading like running a business. That means budgeting your capital, keeping records, analyzing performance, and making adjustments based on data, not emotion. Your journal is your balance sheet. Your setups are your products. Your time and focus are your resources.

When you treat trading like a hobby, it costs you money. When you treat it like a business, it gives you structure and accountability. That shift in mindset is often the difference between gamblers and professionals.

**Bottom line**

Becoming a consistent trader isn’t flashy. It’s not about one big win, a secret indicator, or a magic system. It’s about boring, repetitive, disciplined work.. day after day, year after year. If you accept that reality, you’ll stop chasing shortcuts and actually give yourself a chance to make it.

1nly8v5,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 09:30:35,"5 years of trading, my best tips","I’ve been day trading full-time for about 5 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up accounts, had winning streaks, and gone through phases where I thought I finally “figured it out” only to get humbled the next week. If you’re just getting into this, I’ll save you a lot of pain by sharing the biggest lessons I wish someone drilled into me early on.

1. Risk management is everything.

This is the hill most beginners die on. It doesn’t matter how good your strategy looks, how many indicators you stack on your chart, or how many “conviction trades” you think you’ve found... if you don’t have strict risk rules, the market will clean you out. Always know your max risk per trade. For most people, that’s around 1–2% of your account balance. It sounds boring, but it’s the only thing that keeps you alive long enough to actually learn.

The temptation to “average down” or hold losers is massive when you’re new. You’ll convince yourself that a stock “has to bounce” or “can’t go any lower,” and then watch it tank another 10%. Every trader who’s lasted has their scars from ignoring stop losses. Treat capital like ammo; you only get so much of it, and wasting it on stubbornness will take you out of the game fast.

2. Don’t overtrade.

One of the biggest mistakes I see (and made myself) is thinking you need to be in a trade all the time. The reality is most of the market is just noise. The edge comes from waiting for the handful of clean setups each week that actually make sense. Some of my best months have come from taking fewer than 20 trades total.

It feels counterintuitive at first. You think, “If I’m not in a trade, I’m not making money.” But that’s backwards. By forcing trades, you’re just paying commissions, racking up losses, and burning mental energy. A huge skill in day trading is learning to sit on your hands until your setup appears. That patience is where consistency comes from.

3. Journaling changes the game.

I used to think journaling was pointless. Then I realized most of my losing trades weren’t about the strategy at all; they were about me. When you actually write down why you entered, why you exited, and what you were feeling at the time, patterns start to appear. You might notice you revenge trade after a loss, or that you take bad setups when you’re bored.

Your trading journal becomes your mirror. It forces you to face the truth instead of lying to yourself with hindsight. Over time, it’s less about “what did the chart do” and more about “why did I react this way.” That self-awareness is where growth happens, and without it, you’ll keep repeating the same mistakes.

4. Keep your setup simple.

When you’re new, you want to believe the answer is some secret indicator or complex strategy nobody else knows. So you start stacking indicators until your chart looks like Times Square. I went through that phase too. But after years of testing, I came back to the basics: clean price action, volume, and maybe one or two moving averages. That’s it.

The market isn’t hiding anything from you. Overcomplication just creates decision paralysis. The pros aren’t out here with 15 indicators... they’re reading levels, momentum, and supply/demand zones. Keep your charts clean, focus on setups you can repeat, and you’ll save yourself years of frustration.

5. Protect your mental health.

Trading will wreck you if you let it. If you’re risking rent money or grocery money, you’re trading scared, and scared traders make terrible decisions. You’ll cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and constantly feel like your back’s against the wall. That’s not trading, that’s gambling under pressure.

Detach yourself from the outcome of any single trade. This is easier said than done, but the only way to do it is by trading money you can afford to lose and keeping size small until you’re consistent. If a red day ruins your mood for 24 hours, you’re too emotionally tied to your positions. Protect your headspace first; the money follows when you’re calm.

6. Learn from screen time, not YouTube gurus.

There’s a ton of content online, but no video or course will replace actually watching the market tick by tick. You need screen time to understand how price moves, how news impacts volatility, and how momentum builds and fades. That “intuition” you see in experienced traders doesn’t come from books, it comes from thousands of hours watching patterns unfold live.

Don’t get me wrong, you can pick up useful basics from videos. But the real learning happens when you put skin in the game, track your trades, and experience the emotions firsthand. Nobody can teach you how you react to fear and greed, that’s something only screen time reveals.

7. Consistency > home runs.

The biggest misconception beginners have is thinking they need a massive trade to “make it.” They see screenshots of 10k days on Twitter and start chasing jackpots. The truth is, most accounts blow up because people swing for the fences. Survival in this game comes from small, consistent wins while keeping losses tiny.

A steady $100 a day, compounded, crushes the guy who tries to make $1,000 in one shot and wipes half his account. The math is simple, but the ego makes it hard to follow. Focus on consistency, build confidence, and scale later. Day trading is a marathon of small edges, not a lottery ticket.

Bottom line.

Day trading isn’t easy. Most people fail not because they can’t read charts, but because they underestimate how much discipline, patience, and emotional control it really takes. If you treat this like a craft instead of a get-rich-quick scheme, you’ll give yourself a real shot.

I really like this community so plan on doing more write-ups like these as a mini education series. If you guys want, my next one can be about

A) The biggest mistakes I made in my first year of day trading (so you don’t have to)

B) What a ‘normal’ day actually looks like as a full-time day trader

C) Why 90% of traders quit in under 2 years (and how not to be one of them)

1nlxryy,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 09:09:38,Dropping Construction for Trading—Need Advice and Perspective,"Hey everyone, I just got into trading and I have to say, it’s fucking exciting. I love how, once you learn the basics, it’s all about predicting where the price action is heading based on probability — which I find really cool. The more I get into it, the more I want to leave my crane internship and my mentor behind to focus full-time on trading. 

My construction job varies week to week—sometimes I work 80 hours, other times only 40, but usually it’s between 40 and 80 hours. I’ve been at this job for almost six months now. Honestly, I don’t even love the construction work; I kind of hate it. It’s exhausting, and I just feel like I could be doing something more fulfilling, like trading at home because it’s fun.

I also have about $7,000 saved up, which I think could give me some room to learn and grow as a trader without risking everything right away. I’m considering going back to serving and studying full-time, like I did before I got into construction, since my schedule makes it tough to trade in the mornings when I work. I don’t have debt, but my dad struggles with alcohol dependence and depression, which is really tough emotionally. Sometimes I worry he might pass away suddenly, and that scares me. On the other hand, I feel like I should’ve done more to help him, and that’s been weighing on me.

My crane mentor really supports me and keeps saying I’ll be a great crane operator. I think it’s mostly because he appreciates my go-getter attitude and work ethic, but honestly, can all that hard work not go into trading instead? I’m only 21, but I can’t shake the feeling that I could’ve done more with my life. I don’t even really know why I got into construction in the first place—maybe I thought it was the safe or expected thing, but my real passion is trading.

I want to build a life trading because that’s what excites me, not construction or crane work. I just want to figure out how to focus on trading, make a living from it, and maybe take more control over my life without stressing myself out.

3 months ago, I started trading with some of my pocket money (m, 19). To be honest I eyeballed it with the chosen stocks ( invested in companies I knew as Micron, Nvidia, TSMC, etc, general speaking into the tech). I mostly putted my money in Micron (250€) and bought ½shares of other companies here and there. It somehow paid out and I earned myself nearly 100€ but due to the german tax system they got 25€, which I can recover but still annoying. 

I want to know how to trade with strategies and do some minor analysis on my own. I followed the news daily and kept eye on the companies
Basically, I really liked trading ( unfortunately, only as a hobby for the foreseeable future, As soon as I get a degree and earn money, i would consider making bigger investments) would like to know how and where I can learn how to trade and make educated guesses and do research on my own.

How often should I be checking up on the overall performance of the stock? For example, Invested in a quantum stock 2 days ago, was already up 7% and sold for profit. I'm not afraid of taxes as long as I'm making profit and reinvesting in other companies that are moving fast.

Should I be checking them everyday, every week? I know trends move and money flows... I've been keeping tight numbers of whats doing good etc... I have long term investments and short term, but the short term is what I want to be watching.

Saw a post somewhere that said 15% profit on stocks are a good exit? Obviously doing this comes risk of missing a potential runner like (PLTR,NVDA) if I were to find that startup company early and selling for a short gain.

You own a portfolio except every stock is a creature to collect! Also integrated AI-features so it’ll recommend you stocks, long/short advice, app progression advice, as well as portfolio preferences!","Hi! I wanted to combine my interest in finance, art, and app dev, so I came up with a different type of stock market simulator, where you learn about investing by collecting creatures!

You can enter real stock tickers and decide whether to long/short, and each stock will represent either a bull (long) or bear (short).

Speaking from personal experience, I believe financial literacy and an early understanding of markets can be incredibly valuable for students as they prepare for the future. My prototype still needs a lot of refining, so I would appreciate any feedback!

Here’s the app's core mechanic: you make real stock price predictions. If you think a stock will go up (i.e. “long” a stock), you hatch a bull; if you think it’ll go down (i.e., “short” a stock), you hatch a bear. If your prediction is wrong, your creature loses health, but you can use potions to heal it. Each potion teaches a basic investing concept, like how earnings reports or interest rates affect prices, while improving your creature’s stats. You can also level up for evolution. It’s kind of like Duolingo meets Tamagotchi, but for the stock market.

I’ve noticed I have a really bad habit when trading: as soon as a position starts going my way, I move my stop to breakeven almost immediately. I think it comes from fear of being negative or just wanting to “protect” myself, but the problem is most of the time the trade eventually hits my TP — I just get stopped out at breakeven before it gets there.

I’m trying to break out of this habit, but it feels more psychological than technical. Any advice, tips, or mindset shifts that helped you deal with this would be really appreciated.

1nl59h3,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 10:35:15,Proving Daytrading Any Cryptocurrency is Possible!,"It took a really long time to find a strategy that works without making any personal analysis - just the indicators doing the work for you. I created customized indicators that mixes volume, statistics (i.e., kernel density estimation, etc), and conventional technical analysis equipment (i.e., fibonacci retracement, customized volume profile).

**Abstract**

I conducted a series of manual trades operating between August and September (\~2 months). I decided with 200 trades to create a robust sample size for reliability.

Listed on BINANCE, 26 cryptocurrencies were selected as part of the 200 trades via simple random sampling, with some stratification variability.

* SHELLUSDT.P, STRKUSDT.P, NOTUSDT.P, MYROUSDT.P, BRETTUSDT.P, MOODENGUSDT.P, DEGENUSDT.P, SPELLUSDT.P, BIGTIMEUSDT.P, PIPPINUSDT.P, ACHUSDT.P, OPUSDT.P, KAVAUSDT.P, GALAUSDT.P, DOGSUSDT.P, TRUMPUSDT.P, WUSDT.P, VETUSDT.P, TURBOUSDT.P, AAVEUSDT.P, ROSEUSDT.P, PENGUUSDT.P, REZUSDT.P, DOGEUSDT.P, XRPUSDT.P, and ENAUSDT.P

I started with $100.00 as my initial capital.

* RRR = 1:1
* Leverage: 5x
* Commission fees accounted for

Null hypothesis: The true win-rate is equal to random chance; = 0.50.

Alternative hypothesis: The true win-rate is greater than random chance; > 0.50.

**Results**

* Win-rate: 65.5% in 200 trades (Risk-to-reward ratio = 1:1)
* Net profit: +1552% (i.e., $100.00 -> $1552.41)

**Conclusion**

Test for statistical significance: one-sample proportion z-test

Level of significance: 5%

p-value ≈ 5.82 × 10⁻⁶

Interpretation: We reject the null hypothesis. The strategy's observed win-rate is statistically significantly higher than 50% at conventional significance levels (p = 0.00000582, 95% CI (0.587, 0.717)).

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok so now the abstract is done (just know that my results are not random). Below presents several charts that highlight interesting visuals.

Figure 1: Observed cumulative win-rate progression

Figure 5: Stratified per-symbol win-rate (bootstrapped)

[This one is interesting. It is important to note that ENAUSDT.P is only a sample size of 1, which happened to be a loss.](https://preview.redd.it/m9sp8bk8u4qf1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=db6aa7e197cf6f69c388068fd53941c266669373)

**Limitations**

This strategy was done by manual backtesting. Although objectivity was attempted to be maintained at all costs, they may still be possibility of potential losses that were missed during the backtesting period. However, this is unlikely due to the statistically significant result as shown by the p-value.

**My notes**

I kinda wanted to do this for a while and share to the community that daytrading any cryptocurrency and succeeding (without doing any personal analysis) is possible. It just takes a LOT of time. I am also incredibly surprised the effectiveness of fibonacci and volume profile, but according to my testing, it's not very significant. However, they do boost win rate a little bit.

In the first two months, I absorbed a lot of content, survived the “gambling mode,” and studied the basics (TJR Bootcamp — and please, don’t start saying it’s not good; it helped me understand the fundamentals). Along with TJR and other traders like Kevin Furest and Trader Nocturno, I built a strategy. It’s not entirely mine — it’s more a mix of their points of view.

After that, I spent a month “trading” on TradingView, just setting my entries, SL, and TP. I took 5 trades on XAUUSD that month and won 4 out of 5, making a 7% profit with a 1:2 RR between 9–12 a.m. I knew it wasn’t enough, but I decided to open a demo account on MetaTrader.

August and the first half of September were tough: FOMO, overtrading, seeing trades that weren’t there… losing 7% in a row. Feeling lost, with pressure in my chest, I went back to my philosophy — Stoicism.

After an entire afternoon thinking, meditating, and reviewing my entries from August and September (I keep a journal), I realized I wasn’t sticking to my plan. This month, I’m making sure not to skip my plan. But here’s the thing: I feel like I’m missing something — that little piece that will make everything click in my mind.

When you first started trading, how long did it take before you stopped bleeding your account? How long until you were at least breaking even? And then, how much longer until you were consistently profitable?

I get that everyone’s timeline is different, some blow up multiple accounts before it clicks, others seem to stabilize faster. But I think hearing real experiences (the good and the bad) could be super useful for people like me who are trying to set realistic expectations.

Did something specific shift for you (like journaling, risk management, focusing on fewer setups), or was it just screen time and experience stacking up?

Would love to hear your stories.

1nkxqhb,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 04:11:13,Why News Trading Can Be Risky for Beginners,"
News trading can look exciting — sharp market moves, fast profits, and high energy. But for beginners, it often turns into unnecessary risk. Major news events (like NFP, CPI, or rate decisions) cause sudden spikes in volatility. Prices can move unpredictably, spreads widen, and slippage can eat into trades instantly.

Without experience, it’s easy to get caught on the wrong side of these moves, turning what seemed like a golden opportunity into a big loss. That’s why most new traders are better off mastering technical setups, risk management, and discipline before stepping into news-driven markets.

    •How do you guys practice when you’re just starting out?
    •Should I focus on one specific market (like Forex, crypto, or stocks) or explore multiple at first?
    •How do I track whether I’m improving or just getting lucky on a few trades?
    •Any tips for combining Fibonacci with candlestick patterns more effectively?

1nkt7bl,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 23:45:39,How backtesting changed everything for me.,"I want to share something I wish I understood way earlier in my trading journey: backtesting isn’t about finding the holy grail. It’s about gaining the confidence that your edge actually works and learning to trust it even when the market throws noise at you.

https://preview.redd.it/njy0vhrcm1qf1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee5b3f09ffeaa51aa20dc6782a6f5fdf7d595a7a

Over the last couple of months, I went all-in on backtesting my strategy. Here are my raw stats:



76 trades logged



Net P&L: $45,622.81



Trade win rate: 69.44%



Session win rate: 100% (8/8 sessions green)



Profit factor: 5.31



Trade expectancy: $634



Max drawdown: -$2,912



Average win vs loss: $1,120 vs -$481

https://preview.redd.it/8c15cetdm1qf1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=b710594127dac65dd936103e55e6bf50fb6e4c8d

The equity curve says it all, steady growth, small drawdowns (except one which is normal)  and compounding confidence.



What I Learned from Backtesting



The truth about “high win rate” strategies

Most strategies with 80-90% win rates look good short-term, but collapse once volatility shifts. I learned it’s not about being right every time, it’s about being consistent and protecting downside. My 40-70% win rate worked because my average win was more than double my average loss.



Drawdowns are inevitable

Even in a $45K stretch, I still faced a -$2,900 drawdown. Most traders quit at this point, thinking their strategy is broken. Backtesting taught me that drawdowns aren’t failure, they’re the cost of doing business.



20-30% annual returns are the sweet spot

The dream of doubling your account every year is usually what kills traders. But with backtesting, I saw firsthand that 20-30% annual returns, paired with prop firm capital, is enough to change your life. It’s not flashy, but it’s sustainable.



Confidence comes from data

When you’ve seen your setup play out across months of data, you stop second-guessing yourself in live trading. You stop jumping between strategies. You stop thinking every red day means you’re “broken.” 

I understand that live trading is definitly not the same as backtesting but any supplement of confidence can make a massive difference wehen you hit the markets and can help you preserve your money.



https://preview.redd.it/kap96iqfm1qf1.png?width=1702&format=png&auto=webp&s=7692d735092de28ce0c4199b5b8ce0896ee4c44c

Why Backtesting Changed My Mindset



Before, I’d take a couple of live trades, lose, and assume my edge was gone. I’d switch indicators, try a new YouTube setup, or even buy a course, lord knows I got scammed on so many courses, and some usefuul but just did not resonate with me.



Now, I know that my strategy has a proven expectancy. I know what my win rate is, I know what my drawdowns look like, and I know what kind of return I can expect if I stick with it. That kind of conviction is what separates traders who last from traders who blow up.



Backtesting also made me realize how much time I was wasting in Excel. Logging every trade manually, trying to track profits/losses, drawdowns, win rates… it became a headache. 



Final Thoughts



If you’re serious about trading, backtest your strategy. Not one weekend, not just 20 trades, do it for months. Track everything. Look at expectancy, drawdowns, and long-term performance.

If you want a plan, do it for a full 3months, every single day, go through bullish and bearish marlet cycles, see what ticker or if futures/forex works best for you.



There’s no holy grail strategy. But there is a holy grail process:



Build a simple edge.



Backtest it.



Refine it.



Gain confidence in it.



Then execute it in real-time with discipline.



I’ll leave you with this: your confidence as a trader will never come from watching someone else’s chart, it comes from seeing your own edge play out over and over again.



Now I’m curious:

For those of you who’ve backtested your own setups, what was the biggest realization you had?

1nklchw,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 17:44:20,From Nothing to Profitable: My Grounded Approach to Trading Strategy Design,"Look, most active traders don’t fail because they’re lazy - they fail because they overfit, build strategies backwards &/or never collect enough data.

I’ve been there - chasing systems and setups that didn’t make logical sense or didn’t fit my schedule.

Eventually I stopped following bs noise and started building from nothing the way systems should be built.

I'm going to try to break this down step by step - not just the rules, but how I’d think if I were starting from next to zero trading experience. Regardless if you are Mechanical or Discretionary this guide is designed to help you find your edge.

Let’s say I’ve just decided to become a trader. I know nothing. I just have the will. Here’s what I’d do. For those who’ve seen **Version 1 (Now deleted) search \[4\] to see key changes. Thank you!**

**Citations are visible at the bottom for context if desired**

# #1 I'd feel and adjust to my constraints first

**You start with what is possible for you, personally. That immediately rules out half the noise.**

* Time of day you can realistically trade (not **idealized** \- **realistically**)
* Knowing in advance if you need to sleep or work through certain sessions & what that means for your trading execution
* Do you want to hold trades overnight or not & is it compatible with your system (yes or no, on a strategy-by-strategy basis)
* How much capital will you trade with (eventually)?

**Why? Because all rule-building happens within constraints.**  
If you work a day job and trade 5m charts, you’re probably not able to trade the New York session. If you only trade during London session, you don’t build rules around Asian session. It really depends on time zones and other factors. Higher timeframes like hourly allow for higher versatility.

Ignoring constraints is why a lot of retail traders go nowhere – they copy others without aligning their system with their actual life. If you're ""trading here and there""/""when I can trade, I do X,"" it's adding noise to your results. The more variance in consistency, the worse it is for your bottom line.

# Pick One Market & Timeframe

**You don’t experiment with everything. Pick one instrument and one timeframe.**

For example: Dow Jones, hourly chart

**Why? Because markets behave differently.** Trying to make a system that works on Nasdaq, Gold, EURUSD, and Dow Jones at once is usually unwise. You will overfit or your strategy will break.

**One market. One behaviour set/trade setup.** If you want to run multiple instruments or setups/systems, split the risk amongst them. Each one should be good enough to isolate the risk and perform on its own.

**You must understand how your chosen market behaves. \[3\] & \[5\]**  
**Mean reverting, Alternating/Near Random Walk or Trending**

**Examples**  
Mean reverting: Dow Jones/YM, EURUSD  
Alternating/Near Random Walk: S&P 500/ES  
Trending: Nasdaq/NQ

You can do research to know which is which but if you want in-depth you can ask AI to use Hurst Exponent & Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test over market data.

Or if you're into programming you can get python script to do it. ADF Visuals + Hurst Exponential Chart Example

# Start Building with Logic, Not Results

To clarify, when you're learning, it's okay to look at charts for a while to familiarise yourself with how they look and what the candlesticks show.

The key is to avoid falling into the trap of confirmation bias. **You should write down an idea first, then test it.** **Do not change your rules as you go along.** And most importantly!

**Never go searching through charts to find ideas to test.**

**Start at the drawing board not the candlesticks.**  
Forget indicators. Forget entries. First you need structure. Here's what to make rules about:

**1. Trade Time Window**  
Define which hours are “valid” for entering trades, based on when your chosen market has high volume.  
**Example:** 8am to 4pm NY time for US indices.

**Why?** Because you need volatility to reach targets & volume at your entries for price to trend in your favour regardless of your system style (reversals, mean reversion or trend trading).

**Ex. Rule:**  
“I only take trades between 3pm and 9pm UK time.”

You can mark this with a sessions indicator (e.g. ""Sessions on Chart"" on TradingView, 10:00 to 16:00 setting).

# Risk Management

**Decide what you’re risking per trade.** Fixed % (e.g., 3% of account).  
In a live environment this value can be based on risk tolerance. It must be a logical value that fits within your goals, limits and needs. Your risk needs to be planned ahead, and stuck to. Your risk can be static or dynamic.

**For prop firms, you must calculate your risk to fall in line with the maximum drawdown rules.**

The Amount risked has to be calculated with maximum drawdown & maximum daily drawdown in heavy consideration.

For example, someone may have a system with a loss equivalent to 10 losses in a row -10R maximum in testing his prop firm allows up to 10% maximum drawdown so he decides to trade 0.6% per trade allowing him to have space for that maximum peak to trough drawdown + 50% extra.

**Dynamic example:**  
More Aggressive traders may opt in for back tested rules to increase risk when holding on profitable running positions ex. Entering another position on another rejection (scaling in) or having pre-defined plans to increase risk during winning or losing periods in live environments depending on their risk tolerance & goals.

**Decide what your target-to-stop-loss ratio is before testing the system and stick with it (e.g., RRR: 2:1, 5:1, etc.).**

Don't adjust this to get better trading performance - **pick it based on logic, not data.**

Ex. Rule: “I aim for 4-5R on all reversal trades"" &/or ""3-4R on continuation trades.”

**If the system doesn't work, I throw it out.**

**Added Annotation for clarity: Find \[1\] At end of doc**

# Entry Style (Define Setup Type)

**Bar Replay backtest only.** Never scroll backward to ‘check’ the setup again.

**Pick something linear and logical.**  
Mean reversion? Reversals? Continuations? Breakouts?

Then ask: **What does that look like?**  
Do I want price to hit a level and reject (reversal)?  
Do I want price to push through and pull back (breakout/continuation)?  
**And why would it work?** What does my setup signify via **order flow mechanics**? **\[5\]**

**Order flow isn’t a system or strategy like educators teach.**  
**It’s the basics of how markets move on a tick-by-tick basis.**

**Basic Example explanation:** 

If there's a buyer at $10,000.25 who wants 100 units, but only 80 are available, price moves up one tick to $10,000.5 to fill the rest.

**Ex. 10000.5 50 available 10000.25 80 available**

He gets **80 filled at 10000.25 and 20 (the rest) at 10000.5**

(10000.25\*(80/100))+(10000.5\*(20/100)) = **10000.3 average**

price fill -> price increased to **10000.5**

# This is liquidity.

The only reason price moves is that there’s an imbalance between buy and sell volume. Nothing else

**That's why markets have a highly random nature. Example at Bonus 2**

Tick = minimum price movement on an instrument.

**Example purposes only: 3-wick reversal**

https://preview.redd.it/vbdtsa8hvzpf1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=810d0b202468627ca8a9a7640688943a260c6d5c

**3 Wick Entry Rule example purposes only:**  
“I place limit orders at the beginning wick of a 2-wick consecutive rejection if it forms and closes during my valid trading hours.”  
3 – Sell Limit Filled, Limit order pulled/expired if no fill on **bar 3**

https://reddit.com/link/1nklchw/video/4tg691xnvzpf1/player

**Short example using Order Flow Mechanics Knowledge \[5\]:**  
A wick high in a candle is rejected by the next candle and it closes. Sellers were present at that wick. Regardless of how the ""Order flow"" had taken place it is **irrefutable**.

If price revisits that price or higher and fails again, closing, I want to sell at that price - expecting a third rejection.

**Sell limit order fill, Bracketed with SL & TP (values known before the close)**

Vice versa for long setups.

**Most people who overcomplicate with “smart money” or “institutional”. Talk are waffling.**

# “If you are using charts to execute, you aren't smart money but you don't have to be dumb money either.”

**Dismiss educator narratives on why their methods supposedly work and use critical thinking applying Order flow mechanic basics to accept or dismiss trading entry ideas.**

Don't sleep walk into the ""institutional"" narrative fallacy’s educators sell you. Think about why price moves on a tick by tick basis and what the candlesticks you're basing your entry off actually indicate.

**Markets aren't ruled by patterns they're ruled by imbalances that's what fuels trends. Without an imbalance price won't move.**

If a setup doesn’t have logic like this backing up why it would succeed enough for it to be profitable besides randomness, you’re wasting your time.

# If your only answer to “why does it work?” is “my backtest says so,” you’re doomed

**I’ve asked a trader why he believes his system works besides his data and silence followed for minutes whilst he tried thinking of what to say. I shown him random OHLC candlesticks with his strategy applied and he thrown in the towel. Don’t be like this.**

https://reddit.com/link/1nklchw/video/t1tvferkvzpf1/player

**Examples of what not to base your system on:**

* Pivot points
* Fibonacci (**Based on faith and crowding**)
* MA bounces (**Random and seen on many data sets** ) Shown on Bonus 2 Fig.
* Complex multi-timeframe analysis (**Hard to quantify and bar replay backtest honestly without hindsight fogging vision**)
* Most **well known** indicators for entries

These methods are 1000% random with weak foundations or are purposefully hard to test accurately and honestly without overfitting. **Educators push it for plausible deniability when systems don’t perform. A model is hard to hold to account if there’s 1000 ways to trade it. The use of Multi time frame analysis in trading is fine as long as it’s not convoluted, has clear rules and is tested properly.**

# Target & Stop Loss Placement

**Targets must be placed consistently.**  
Targets are typically less important than entries and stops – but still important.

If using price structures (e.g. support/resistance), **define the logic first**, then the rules.

Ex. Someone could use swing highs/lows, support/resistance,

clustered wicks or rejection zones. **With fixed rules to define and mark them in advance.**

Price will naturally attract volume at these levels, **even if the instrument's order book volume doesn't reflect it in real time**. Ghost limit orders exist, pending stop orders & order fill algorithm triggers from **countless market participants for different reasons** it doesn't matter what happens when price interacts with these places it's just more often than not that they are **liquid areas**.

**Avoid fixed-distance targets - market volatility is dynamic.**

For example, a ""100 point fixed target"" or a ""20 point fixed stop"" is arbitrary and is not going to work if volatility shifts.

It is better to use dynamic yet consistent targeting methods. A trader must define fixed rules for regarding what is S/R and what is not.

So a dynamic targeting method ex. at defined highs or lows would be that for one trade it is 110 points, the second being 160 points, and the next is 140 points (all placed at predefined levels).

**Fixed targets overfit strategies easily.**

Your **execution costs** must be factored into your system.

Ex. 

If you use a 1:5 RR and a 100-pt target minimum, your minimum stop is 20 pts. 

If your max spread on your CFD is \~2pts, that’s 10% cost per trade - before everything else which matters.

Ex Rule: 

“Target is always ≥100 points for Dow. Stop is one-fifth of target.” - Why? Because it keeps costs at a modest level.

# Instrument-Specific Rules

**Some markets behave uniquely. You don’t need deep stats – just basic experience.**

* Nasdaq trends
* Dow mean reverts
* S&P 500 alternates. (Trending but Near random walk)
* Gold is erratic

Example: If you want mean reversion or early trend entries, Dow is a better choice than Nasdaq.

**Entry Model Influence Example:**  
**Example 1:** If you want mean reversion or early trend entries, Dow is a better choice than Nasdaq. (It’s more probable for Dow reverse intraday)  
**Example 2:** If you want to press trades or let positions run, Nasdaq is a better choice than Dow. (Trends are more pronounced on Nasdaq compared to Dow intraday)  
Either can have a trend or mean reversion model, but different strategies will tend to work better if aligned with the instrument’s nature.

**Strategy Risk Management Setup Influence Examples:**  
**Example 1:** If you have a strategy idea that includes rules to manually trail your stop loss in profit or uses large targets relative to stop size, Nasdaq would likely be a better choice compared to Dow. (Nasdaq trends more intraday which compliments this idea; Dow tends to mean revert/snap back, reducing the potential for home run trades.)  
**Example 2:** If you have a mean reversion strategy idea with a hard take profit and stop loss as risk management (most common), the Dow would likely be a better choice, as its intraday trends are less pronounced compared to the Nasdaq.

 

**Either market can have a trend and/or mean reversion model**, but different entry and risk management strategies will tend to work better if aligned with the instrument’s nature;

# These guidelines are of course not absolutes.

**Trending = Larger price extensions**, **Mean reversion = Higher likelihood of returning to the average price.**

**ADF & Hurst isn’t supposed to be used in real time it’s supposed to be used once to define an instrument and save time testing. Don’t forget that.**

# Start from Blank Charts

Instead of top-down start bottom up.

People look at charts for ideas when you need to **consult logic for inspiration**; **not recency biases from recent price action**. **Added Annotation for clarity: Find \[2\] At end of doc**

Back testing is there to put an idea to the test.

**Before building rules based on the chart, define a hypothesis.**

**Example:** 

**“What if I traded Dow Jones reversals using 3-wick setups with a 5R limit entry?”**

Then test this visually. On charts

**You’re not trying to make it “fit,” but to ask:**

*- Does this work during valid hours?* 

*- Does the visual match my logic?* 

*- Does the reaction make sense knowing Order flow’s nature?* 

*- Would my setup realistically hit target often enough to net a profit over time?*

**Only then write rules to test.**

# Write Rules as If You’re Giving Them to a Machine

**Your rules must be:**

* **Objective**
* **Actionable**
* **Not open to interpretation**
* **Modest costs ideally <20% Don’t let it exceed 30% of your expected R or your edge collapses (Exponential costs)** ex. If you risk $100 and your RR is 5:1 but after adding spread, comms and other costs like slippage it’s >3.5R / >70% of R realised minimum>$350 minimum on each 5R setup

**Bad Rule:**  
“If the market is ranging, I don’t trade.” **(No definition for range or how to identify it)**

**Good Rule:**  
“If a 3-wick setup forms between 3–9pm UK time, and the high/low of setup is beyond/below \[X filter\], place sell limit at top wick or buy limit at low wick.” **(Rule based intuition/discretion free)**

**Define everything clearly** \- the filter, logic, conditions, etc.

# Stress Test the System by Breaking It

**Once rules are written, test them brutally.** 

Ask:

\- Is this rule based on **logic** or **emotional comfort?** **Be emotionally detached**

  (ex. Breakeven or partial profits reduce strategy net profit - so why use them?)\*

Partials or Breakeven reduce strategy expectancy more often than not\*

\- Does it work over 3+ months of data? (Depending on timeframe)

1R = 1 unit of risk ex. 3%

Log the data, process it -1R+4R-1R-1R+4R

# - What if market conditions flip? (Test on conditions against the system's nature)

Test mean reversion and reversal systems on trending weeks & if you're trading trend trading systems test them on mean reverting/ranging weeks. See your system struggle. Example (Surface Level)

Date Example August 8**^(th)** to September 13**^(th)** **2024 on mean reversion systems for YM/Dow Jones is a good place to stress test due to the relentless intraday trends exhibited.**

**- What if trading costs rise 20%? (Reduce size of profits by \~20%)**

\- after the initial rejection candle close if there is an additional rejection should I scale in/increase the risk on the trade (Entry 2 typically has higher win rate vs Entry 1 when scaling in for my systems\*\*) testing will confirm whether it's worth doing\*\*. **To scale in or not to scale in**

Scaling in is only worth doing is the win rate if Entry 2 is superior to that of Entry 1 ex. 45% winrate Entry 2 vs 40% winrate (main entries) most systems don't benefit largely from it so **be careful.**

**Entry = Individual Trade Execution (filled with 1R risk per trade ex, 3%) 2 Entries = 3% \* 2 = 6% for example.**

**- Should I hedge or wait until my position is closed to enter setups on the opposite direction?**

**-Is it worth holding overnight?**

**-Do I have enough leverage/margin to trade this strategy on my broker or prop firm of choice (find out the leverage needed maximum per trade with stop distance % relative to % risk per trade desired)**

# You're not seeking perfection, but robustness. 

**If a small change breaks your system - it’s overfit noise.**

# Bonus: When in Doubt, Zoom Out

**Ask: Does this decision happen every trade?**  
If yes, write a rule. If not, STOP, think, and evaluate the logic.

**You should:**

* **Know your risk % – make a rule**
* **Know your stop – make a rule**
* **Aim to know target, stop, and entry price(s) before the candle closes  (Bracketed limit orders help a lot.)**

# Bonus 2: Market Randomness

**I’m not saying the market is efficient, I’m saying it’s very close so you need to be refined in your approach. It’s not a choice**

# Added Annotations [4]:

**\[1\] The specific ratios don't matter. You shouldn't be curve fitting/overfitting your system (trying to find the best ratio)**

Elaboration:

The logic in the example behind using 3-4R in continuation trades is that you should allow for larger movements against your entry because you're entering in the middle of a trend. For example, when trend following, if you're buying, you are executing at premium prices, not at discount prices. more space for error is required.

And 4-5 Ratio for example is encouraging tighter stop losses relative to target for Reversals because you're actively going against the trend.

The ratios given were example ratios you can change them based on your ideas.

**\[2\] When I mean consult logic, I meant order flow mechanics \[3\] which I mention in the document primarily but it's also about rejecting ideas like MA Bounces and Fibonacci which aren't logical reasons to engage with the markets.**

Wick high = selling pressure

Wick low = buying pressure

Body = sustained buying or selling within the time slot on the data series/chart

Use this knowledge to create your own ideas for logical trade entry systems to test

**\[3\] ADF & Hurst Exponent Overview**

ADF shows you if a data series/chart reverts to it’s mean (average price)

Hurst tells you if a data series/chart trends, reverts or leans towards a random walk. Helps decide trending market vs mean reverting market.

**1. ADF Test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller)**

What it ADF tells you in practice:

ADF checks whether a time series is mean-reverting i.e., do things tend to wander off indefinitely, or does it tend to return to some average value over time elapsed.

If the ADF test is “significant” (p-value < 0.05):

The series does revert to a mean.

When a time series ex a candlestick chart is mean reverting imagine price is like a stretched rubber band when it moves away from the average, it tends to snap back/reverse.

If it's not significant (p-value > 0.05):

The series is likely a random walk, drifting unpredictably without any sort of central anchor.

2. Hurst Exponent

What Hurst tells you in practice:

It quantifies how “trendy” or “mean-reverting” a time series is.

H ≈ 0.5 The chart/time series is random noise; random walk/Brownian motion.

H < 0.5 → The chart is mean-reverting tends to snap back.

H > 0.5 → The chart has momentum tends to have extensions/continuation in the same direction i.e trend.

**Key Changes in Version 2 \[4\]:**

Many small tweaks for clarity, added important clarifications especially on Step 7, included annotations for context, and I’ve provided definitions to support beginners.

The model hasn’t changed it’s just explained better. Changes were based on trader insights and needs. Thanks for the feedback. I Appreciate it – Ron.

# TL;DR & Summary:

**Structure before everything.**  
**Logic before data.**  
**Consistency before optimization.**  
Logic → Rules → Data → Optimisation **(Based on ideas, not data or it’s curve fitting)“Why” before “What.”**

**Every rule is based on:**

1. **What you can realistically do**
2. **What the market allows** (ex scalping CFDs is usually not a viable strategy due to higher or exaggerated costs on higher lot sizes) 
3. **What gives clear, repeatable decisions**

**You don’t optimize to improve win rate or net gain.**  
You optimize to enhance the logic behind the system – which often translates to improved performance (net gain)

Yes – the first 0–20 hours (first few testing sessions) will feel foggy. Then it clicks.  
You’ll never know if it works until you test it exactly as written.  
That’s when the market becomes your teacher.

If a system implodes/stops working it doesn't mean a different variation of it can't work again in the future.

1nkkj55,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 17:12:05,20 years of trading: my biggest mistakes & lessons,"I’ve been trading for about 20 years now, and looking back, most of my setbacks weren’t about having the “wrong” strategy, honestly, they were just about my own behavior (as hard as that is to admit).

The two biggest mistakes I made early on:

1. **Selling winners too early.** I can’t count the times I sold stocks like Meta or Nvidia after a quick 2x, only to watch them 10x or 100x later. The short-term mindset killed me. If you really believe in a company and have done the work, sometimes the best move is to sit on your hands and let time do the heavy lifting.
2. **Not focusing on my edge.** Most of my losses came from chasing trends outside of my lane. Where I’ve consistently done well is riding blue chips and staying in areas where I actually understand the fundamentals. It’s boring sometimes, but boring makes money as much as people on social media preach the opposite.

If I could give my younger self advice:

* Journal every trade so you can see your *own* patterns (good and bad).
* Don’t force setups just to feel active — patience > action.
* Protect your mental capital. Trading scared is worse than not trading at all.

That’s just my take though. So, I’m curious, for those of you with more years under your belt: what’s the #1 mistake you wish you could go back and avoid?",27,4,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nkkj55/20_years_of_trading_my_biggest_mistakes_lessons/,new,Advice,0.88

1nkhybe,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 15:33:31,Trading Is the Hardest Thing I’ve Ever Done,"

I grew up in a small town in Mexico. My parents worked jobs that barely kept food on the table, and from a young age, I knew if I wanted something more, I’d have to figure it out myself. At 19, I crossed the border with nothing but a backpack, a few clothes, and a dream of building a better life.

I washed dishes, stocked shelves overnight, and sent money home when I could. I shared a one-bedroom apartment with three other guys just to cover rent. Some weeks I worked 70–80 hours, only to end up with barely enough left to buy groceries. It was exhausting, but I kept telling myself, “This is temporary, justy keep moving.”

Then I discovered amazon FBA, failed. Dropshipping, failed and then finallly trading. I thought it would be my escape, finally a way to use my brain instead of my back. I opened a brokerage account, put in a few thousand dollars, and thought I could flip it fast. I lost it all in less than two months. The frustration was unreal. I felt like I was running in circles: breaking my body at work, then burning through savings at night chasing green candles.

But I didn’t quit. I slowed down and started studying. I found futures and realized this was a real profession, not a shortcut. I backtested for months. I journaled every mistake. I cut my size to the smallest possible and focused on surviving first. Slowly, things started to click. My first payout from a prop firm wasn’t big, just $1,000 but it felt like the world to me. It proved I wasn’t crazy for believing I could do this.

Here’s what trading taught me: it’s not a hustle, it’s a mirror. It shows you every weakness and impatience, ego, greed and forces you to deal with them. That’s why it’s harder than any job I’ve ever worked. Because it doesn’t just demand skill; it demands you to change who you are.

Today, I’m not rich, but I’m consistent. I can finally say I trade with confidence. I still send money home. I still live simply. But I built this life from nothing, and that’s something no one can take from me.

And if there’s one thing I know for sure:

1nkclol,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 12:13:24,Trying to find trading for my risk tolerance and personality,"EDIT: Title should say trading/investing strategies.    
  
FYI, I have another thread on the bogle head and I have some indexes I've picked and going to see how they do.  However, I'm curious as to others in my situation and mindset, what strategies have you went with and why.  Also, what tools, data etc are you using.

For me, I get stock purchases every quarter at a discount some options.  So that's what put me in the market many years ago.  I just never looked at it until around 2020 where I got more aggressive on also doing a large paycheck contribution as well.

This past year, things have really taken off, I have nvda like everybody, then other mag 7 because I believe in AI and the changes it's going to make.  I have had the voo's, schg's etc.

In April, like everybody else, heart sank when taking those kinds of loses but I've always looked at the market like calculated gambling so easy come easy go.  But then the recovery has been a sight to watch.

So now, I have some of the boglehead strategy to see how it does.  Some in high yield savings I'm looking to convert to bonds.

But I'd really like to start learning how to understand and pick companies without just knowing they are doing good in the tech industry and have a ""feeling"" they are going to do good.  My instincts told me to purchase Broadcom and Oracle a year ago, but I already have a lot in companies like nvda, the voice of reason keeps pulling me back to not be greedy and risk $ making 4.5% right now when I have quite a bit in equities.

However, I want to try and learn for example, BBW, when I go look at the performance of that the past few years, it's been better than Nvda.  In my paper trading account on alpaca, I'm up 5k in the past month on it and the indicators and reports I look at in Fidelity have it as good as anything I have invested.  But then i watch it daily, it's a lot more volatile than a nvda, msft, googl it seems.

So is so much out there and most seems it's more about getting $ from you on a proven strategy than actually being worthwhile.

I don't have time to day trade so not looking to scalp, I'm more so looking for ways to try and find good compound earners and learn how to take my current assets and have the work for me in a comfortable fashion without basically putting everything on black and letting it ride.

To be clear, I'm not asking for stock picks, a breakdown of large cap, small cap, bonds etc, just what others are doing if you just like to research, learn what companies are good or have the potential to do good and have a good idea of the upside and down side risk say the next 1/4, 6 months or year.

In summary, for somebody that just wants to research and find companies, indexes, etfs have potential to be the next palantir, nvda, probably a chatgpt if it ever goes public etc, and do so in a way that you know how to monitor and know when the indicators point to it's time to move on.

Also, not looking to put an entire portfolio into this, just going to start taking any extra change I have and start learning how.  What tools would you recommend?  Trading View with Alpaca, or there is [investor.com](http://investor.com) and others.  Also, would be curious as to why you use what you use as well.

Finally, I'm not young, not trying to get rich quick, but as I put in my post in the boglehead section, if I could figure out a way to comfortably take what I have an make 6 to 8% on average, then I'm lucky enough right now to be able to cover expenses and keep growing assets which for me would finally be freedom.  :)  Yes I'm researching and going through other recommendations but there is just so much and starting my own thread I can use in my search.",1,2,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nkclol/trying_to_find_trading_for_my_risk_tolerance_and/,new,Discussion,1.0
1nkbkcx,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 11:35:00,Thinking about Luck,"Probability and luck are not either/or. You don't need to exclusively subscribe to probability or exclusively subscribe to luck in stock market trading. I think this is where people face-off with absolute conviction to one or the other, but reading Taleb on luck and black swans, I'm starting to see that being a probability absolutist is nearly as bad as subscribing to having zero belief that anything you do will make a difference because it's all luck.

If you ignore the possibility of luck (good and bad), then you are missing a piece of the risk puzzle. Even if you don't change anything in your approach, it is advantageous to be aware of luck and to think about how it might impact your strategy.

The most important question for me being, am I doing enough to cover my arse if a piece of bad luck strikes. This doesn't necessarily mean becoming overly defensive, but the most basic means of protection is only investing what you can afford to lose. (This is the no. 1 trading rule based on luck.)

The thing I've changed based on this awareness of luck is to not be too exact with probability, and not treat it like I'm reading tea leaves of what will happen and that it remains a set of guidelines the accuracy of which only the real world will determine, so my probability margins must be meatily weighted towards profitability but be general enough to not simply cherry pick from the past.",1,3,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nkbkcx/thinking_about_luck/,new,Discussion,1.0

I post this to show you all out there that are struggling and that think you cannot do it what real trading looks like. A lot people say a lot of things, but no one really shows something real. This is real. This is my trading in my ThinkOrSwim account, honestly I am not sure if this is all year or what the exact time frame because when I change the dates not much changes. BUT, this is my performance. I want to you to notice a few things. 

1. I cut losses quickly. 

2. I have several good gainers from my basic strategy

3. I get lucky and get a big winner every once in a while! 

This has been fairly consistent for me over the past several years, I was profitable in 2017 and I haven't looked back! I caught, TSLA, NVDA and now IONQ those have been my big winners. But as shown in the screenshot I can make good money in many other names. If your account can look anywhere near this in terms of your losers being small and your winners being big then you will be successful at trading. 

I think its paramount to 100% believe that you are taking the right approach, my strategy is a mix of things, its IBD breakouts with options with my own mix of things I have noticed and learned over the years. I believe in market themes and CHARTS. 

I ALSO TIME THE MARKETS for all you saying you cannot time the markets. No YOU can't time the markets, but people do it every day. I trade several other accounts as well and have 10's 4 accounts with just leveraged ETFs and market timing.

Also notice that I was able to lose money on PLTR this year! No one is perfect, so don't judge 

I know eventually this post will get buried, but this is what it looks like when you manage your risk/reward levels, have patience when entering positions and are picky with what you trade. I missed out on so many but honestly I can't recall them so does it really matter? This is not a cherry picked list, I was surprised by how little names I traded, but this is the whole thing.

The plan is straightforward, build a $15K cushion from trading profits alone before leaving my job. That gives me a full year of living expenses covered:

• $2,760 for rent ($230 x 12 months)
• $4,560 for my salary ($380 x 12 months)

I’m already accustomed to living lean and making ~$238/month at my current job, so survival isn’t the issue. The first three months after leaving won’t even be focused on trading. They’ll be about decompressing, appreciating life, and recharging before going all-in.

That’s it. No overcomplication, no delusion, just a base, a buffer, and time.

1nk9w4g,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 10:31:23,Ready to be embarrassed.. here are my biggest mistakes I made in my first year of trading...,"Lol when I first started messing around with stocks and option trading, I thought I was smarter than the market. I genuinely wanted to ""turn $1000 into $10000"" and just keep going. So, I watched all the videos, read all the stupid books, and figured I’d pick it up fast. Instead, my first year was a series of expensive lessons. It was bad. I blew up accounts, overtraded, and ignored the basics that I now know are non-negotiable. If you’re just starting out, i reaply wanted to write out my biggest mistakes I made that you can hopefully avoid. This is part 2 of an ongoing education series for those who are interested in following. Hopefully this can help some of you guys.

1. Trading too big, too soon.

Sizing up too fast was my downfall more than once. I thought the quickest way to grow an account was to swing big. The problem is, your emotions swing just as big. When you’re over-leveraged, you stop following your plan and start praying. That’s when panic selling, bag-holding, and account blow-ups happen.

Looking back, I should’ve kept my position size embarrassingly small until I was profitable for months at a time. Trading tiny builds discipline without wrecking your confidence or your account. The truth is, year one isn’t about making money, it’s about surviving long enough to actually get good.

2. Chasing alerts and hype.

Bruh, I spent months glued to X or reddit “gurus.” Every time they called out a ticker, I’d jump in without thinking. I almost always bought too late, and when the move reversed, I’d eat the loss. It felt like I was trading, but really I was just gambling on other people’s ideas.

The problem is you don’t have conviction in trades you didn’t find yourself. You’ll panic out the second it goes red, or hold too long hoping the guru is right. Once I ditched alerts and focused on building my own watchlists, my trading improved overnight. If you can’t explain why you’re in a trade, you shouldn’t be in it.

3. Ignoring stop losses.

This was my most expensive mistake. I’d set a stop, but when price got close I’d convince myself to “give it room.” Before I knew it, the loss was 3x what I planned. It only takes a couple of these to wreck your account and your headspace.

The truth is, honoring stops isn’t about being right or wrong; it’s about protecting your capital so you can trade another day. Blowing past stops is a rookie move that costs you money and keeps you stuck in a cycle of regret. If you only fix one mistake from this list, make it this one.

4. Overtrading out of boredom.

The urge to click buttons just to feel like you’re “doing something” is real. I’d sit there staring at charts, waiting for action, and eventually take subpar trades just to scratch the itch. Most of those turned into small, frustrating losses that added up.

Learning to do nothing when nothing’s there was one of the hardest skills I had to learn. Some days the best trade really is no trade. The market rewards patience, not action. Treat your trading capital like bullets; you don’t fire unless the target is clear.

5. Thinking strategy was everything.

In my first year, I hopped from one strategy to the next like a kid in a candy store. I thought I just hadn’t found the “holy grail” yet. The problem wasn’t the strategies... it was me. I wasn’t giving anything enough time to actually master it, and I wasn’t disciplined enough to stick to the rules.

What I eventually realized is that most strategies work if you execute them consistently and manage risk. Two traders can run the same setup (one profits, the other blows up) because psychology, discipline, and risk management matter more than the setup itself.

6. Not tracking my trades.

I went months without journaling or reviewing my trades. At the time, I thought I’d just “remember” what worked. Lol I didn’t... I repeated the same mistakes over and over because I had no system for holding myself accountable.

Once I started journaling (writing down why I entered, why I exited, and how I felt) I saw my patterns clear as day. I realized I revenge traded after losses, chased green candles, and cut winners too early. Tracking isn’t sexy, but it’s the only way to spot flaws in your behavior and actually fix them.

7. Not protecting my mental health.

Trading wrecked me emotionally that first year. I tied my self-worth to my P/L, so every red day felt like a personal failure. I’d overtrade trying to “make it back” or sit there depressed after one bad trade. That cycle burned me out.

The fix was learning to detach from the outcome of a single trade or even a single day. The only thing that matters is consistency over time. If you let your emotions run the show, you’ll destroy yourself. Protecting your mindset is just as important as protecting your account balance.


Take away

Your first year probably won’t make you rich. Mine didn’t. What it will do is teach you the lessons that separate gamblers from traders. Blowups, losses, and frustration are part of the process, but you don’t need to make all the same mistakes I did. Start small, track everything, respect risk, and don’t forget this is a long game. I plan on posting more here so feel free to follow my acc if you're interested.

1nk9ia5,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 10:16:30,How can i improve my strategy,"Core flow
	1.	Reference levels (HTF H/L): Uses previous 4H / Daily / Weekly / Monthly highs & lows (locked to the prior closed bar).
	2.	Sweep detection (on MTF): Detects when price sweeps above/below those HTF levels on a chosen MTF (mtfTF) with a small buffer and optional close condition.
	3.	MTF FVG confirmation: On the same MTF, confirms a bull/bear FVG (no repaint—uses confirmed bars only).
	•	When sweep + FVG align, it records the FVG range and the MTF swing (the pivot that “created” that FVG).
	4.	First Touch → “Strong” trigger (on LTF):
	•	Waits for First Touch of that MTF FVG on the LTF (close inside the zone).
	•	After FT, it arms a “strong” entry condition: requires a new LTF FVG in the same direction (optional minimum gap %).
	•	There’s a TTL (max bars to wait after FT) you can set; if it expires, the window closes.
	•	Safety: If the MTF swing that created the FVG breaks after FT, it stops searching for the LTF confirmation.
	5.	Filters:
	•	Killzones (UTC-4) time filter.
	•	AlphaTrend bias (optional): Only long when AT is rising, only short when falling.
	6.	Risk/Trade management:
	•	Position sizing by % of initial capital.
	•	SL can be based on LTF swing or the MTF swing that created the FVG (your choice), with optional pad %.
	•	Optional fixed TP by RR (e.g., 2R).
	7.	Visuals:
	•	Draws the MTF FVG zone (lines + optional fill).
	•	Draws a horizontal sweep line from the level’s previous HTF bar time to the bar that caused the sweep at the exact swept price (bull uses the low-side level, bear the high-side level).

Backtests can look great, but we all know they can be overfit. Forward tests give more confidence, but they take time and may not capture every condition.

In my own journey, I struggled with this question until I started using SpeedBot for my option strategies. The workflow of building a strategy without code, backtesting, forward testing, and then running it live with automated execution and detailed reports gave me a much clearer way to evaluate performance step by step. It did not make the decision easy, but it did make the process structured and less about guesswork.

I am curious how others here approach this.

When I sized too big, every tick against me felt like my stomach was dropping. I’d close trades early just to “feel safe,” or I’d add more size to “fix” a bad entry. It wasn’t the market beating me, it was my own emotions.



Once I started tracking everything, I noticed something insane: my win rate barely changed when I cut my size in half. But my stress level dropped by 80%. Suddenly, I was following my rules. Suddenly my setups actually had a chance to play out.



That’s when I learned: risk management isn’t about surviving one trade. It’s about giving yourself the mental space to survive the next 1,000 trades.



Profitable trading isn’t about swinging for home runs. It’s about staying alive long enough to let your edge work.

  
A lot of traders get too focused on the most perfect entry, but they should actually build a risk management system after they've found their edge and model.

	•	Some words are also tickers (e.g. “CAN” or “ALL”), which turns the results into clown data.

I took a break, then used some money I had saved up to try again. That’s when I found TJR’s bootcamp, which pulled me into futures trading. Through him, I learned about prop firms.

I’ve blown probably 40 accounts and lost thousands of dollars. My turning point was when I stopped trying to learn every little thing about trading — whether it was on TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube. I cut all of it out and just stuck to one model (still TJR’s trading model), just with a different form of entry and a slightly different way of viewing it.

Once I cut the noise out and focused on one model, I was able to turn profitable and pass accounts easily.

The only tips I have are: FIND A MENTOR AND STICK TO IT. And find a community or someone who can hold you accountable for your actions. Once you master your strategy — whatever it may be — it’s all about psychology.

1njbd5d,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 08:09:59,Not getting confidence in any strategy.,"I have been trading for last 4 yrs. Recently, I have realised that I have got everything in line psychology, risk management, time frame to trade on, journalling, etc. One bottleneck, since a long time has been no confidence in my strategy, to earn 50% win rate. Brief background, I am an intraday trader, trade with 15mins candles, in the Indian stock market. I have expectation to have a 50% win rate and a 1:2RR. I am also mentally strong enough to bare the DD and I accept the loss as it is nothing but the trade went on the other side of the probability and accept that won or loss in this is not in my control but, over a period of time, I will have a decent win rate. 

The problem: 
I have tried a lot of times to understand that price and patterns are formed by market participants psychology and tried to make sense of it but, I can't logically accept the fact that traders and investors are looking at the trendline and reacting at that level. I firmly believe that whatever actions they are taking is based on the new update about that company or generally which led them to make the decision. Traders takes the action with or after an investor has made his action to a update. I believe that in the past if people sold the stock at 100, doesn't mean this time also they will sell at 100. this makes no sense to me. I have worked at an investment firm and investors don't make decisions based on the levels. In short, I don't believe past traders and investors actions will have any influence on the current or future actions but a new update will. My edge will come from me reacting on that update first and then other people reacting will shoot the price up and I will make money. But, here also I am not sure if I will have a 50% prob or not and just not sure what to do. I do believe in swings and keep at stops at the swing lows.

1nj47mb,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 01:03:31,😌 Stoic Secrets for Trading Success,"Markets test patience, discipline, and resilience every single day. Stoicism, a philosophy built on clarity and self-mastery, offers traders tools to survive volatility and avoid self-destruction.

Here are ten principles worth living by:

🟡 Focus on what you can control

You can’t control the market, the news cycle, or other traders. You can control your research, your risk management, and your execution. Anchor yourself there.

🟡 Cultivate a growth mindset

Losses aren’t failure, they’re tuition. Keep a journal, extract lessons, and adapt. Each trade becomes a step forward.

🟡 Practice self-discipline

Stick to your plan when emotions flare. Review rules daily, set clear intentions, and don’t let fear or greed dictate entries.

🟡 Embrace discomfort

Volatility, new assets, losing trades - they all sharpen you. Lean into what feels uncomfortable, it expands your skillset.

🟡 Live with purpose and integrity

Trading for money alone leads to reckless choices. Define your deeper “why” and align your actions with it.

🟡 Build resilience

One bad week doesn’t end a career. Detach self-worth from outcomes, learn, reset, and stay in the game.

🟡 Practice gratitude

Gratitude keeps perspective. Wins, losses, even the chance to trade at all - acknowledge them. It strengthens mindset.

🟡 Self-reflection

Review your trades, but also your emotions. Awareness of your own patterns is often the biggest edge.

🟡 Cultivate strong relationships

Even in a solitary craft, community matters. Mentors, peers, and trading circles expand perspective and keep you grounded.

🟡 Focus on long-term goals

Day-to-day noise is a distraction. Sustainable trading comes from compounding disciplined decisions over years, not chasing every quick win.

Trading is more than charts and setups. It’s a battle with yourself. Stoic principles won’t make you rich overnight, but they’ll keep you standing long enough to let skill and discipline pay off.

1nik9y3,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 11:14:20,"5 years of trading, my best tips","I’ve been day trading full-time for about 5 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up accounts, had winning streaks, and gone through phases where I thought I finally “figured it out” only to get humbled the next week. If you’re just getting into this, I’ll save you a lot of pain by sharing the biggest lessons I wish someone drilled into me early on.

1. Risk management is everything.

This is the hill most beginners die on. It doesn’t matter how good your strategy looks, how many indicators you stack on your chart, or how many “conviction trades” you think you’ve found... if you don’t have strict risk rules, the market will clean you out. Always know your max risk per trade. For most people, that’s around 1–2% of your account balance. It sounds boring, but it’s the only thing that keeps you alive long enough to actually learn.

The temptation to “average down” or hold losers is massive when you’re new. You’ll convince yourself that a stock “has to bounce” or “can’t go any lower,” and then watch it tank another 10%. Every trader who’s lasted has their scars from ignoring stop losses. Treat capital like ammo; you only get so much of it, and wasting it on stubbornness will take you out of the game fast.

2. Don’t overtrade.

One of the biggest mistakes I see (and made myself) is thinking you need to be in a trade all the time. The reality is most of the market is just noise. The edge comes from waiting for the handful of clean setups each week that actually make sense. Some of my best months have come from taking fewer than 20 trades total.

It feels counterintuitive at first. You think, “If I’m not in a trade, I’m not making money.” But that’s backwards. By forcing trades, you’re just paying commissions, racking up losses, and burning mental energy. A huge skill in day trading is learning to sit on your hands until your setup appears. That patience is where consistency comes from.

3. Journaling changes the game.

I used to think journaling was pointless. Then I realized most of my losing trades weren’t about the strategy at all; they were about me. When you actually write down why you entered, why you exited, and what you were feeling at the time, patterns start to appear. You might notice you revenge trade after a loss, or that you take bad setups when you’re bored.

Your trading journal becomes your mirror. It forces you to face the truth instead of lying to yourself with hindsight. Over time, it’s less about “what did the chart do” and more about “why did I react this way.” That self-awareness is where growth happens, and without it, you’ll keep repeating the same mistakes.

4. Keep your setup simple.

When you’re new, you want to believe the answer is some secret indicator or complex strategy nobody else knows. So you start stacking indicators until your chart looks like Times Square. I went through that phase too. But after years of testing, I came back to the basics: clean price action, volume, and maybe one or two moving averages. That’s it.

The market isn’t hiding anything from you. Overcomplication just creates decision paralysis. The pros aren’t out here with 15 indicators... they’re reading levels, momentum, and supply/demand zones. Keep your charts clean, focus on setups you can repeat, and you’ll save yourself years of frustration.

5. Protect your mental health.

Trading will wreck you if you let it. If you’re risking rent money or grocery money, you’re trading scared, and scared traders make terrible decisions. You’ll cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and constantly feel like your back’s against the wall. That’s not trading, that’s gambling under pressure.

Detach yourself from the outcome of any single trade. This is easier said than done, but the only way to do it is by trading money you can afford to lose and keeping size small until you’re consistent. If a red day ruins your mood for 24 hours, you’re too emotionally tied to your positions. Protect your headspace first; the money follows when you’re calm.

6. Learn from screen time, not YouTube gurus.

There’s a ton of content online, but no video or course will replace actually watching the market tick by tick. You need screen time to understand how price moves, how news impacts volatility, and how momentum builds and fades. That “intuition” you see in experienced traders doesn’t come from books, it comes from thousands of hours watching patterns unfold live.

Don’t get me wrong, you can pick up useful basics from videos. But the real learning happens when you put skin in the game, track your trades, and experience the emotions firsthand. Nobody can teach you how you react to fear and greed, that’s something only screen time reveals.

7. Consistency > home runs.

The biggest misconception beginners have is thinking they need a massive trade to “make it.” They see screenshots of 10k days on Twitter and start chasing jackpots. The truth is, most accounts blow up because people swing for the fences. Survival in this game comes from small, consistent wins while keeping losses tiny.

A steady $100 a day, compounded, crushes the guy who tries to make $1,000 in one shot and wipes half his account. The math is simple, but the ego makes it hard to follow. Focus on consistency, build confidence, and scale later. Day trading is a marathon of small edges, not a lottery ticket.

Bottom line.

Day trading isn’t easy. Most people fail not because they can’t read charts, but because they underestimate how much discipline, patience, and emotional control it really takes. If you treat this like a craft instead of a get-rich-quick scheme, you’ll give yourself a real shot.

I really like this community so plan on doing more write-ups like these as a mini education series. If you guys want, my next one can be about 

A) The biggest mistakes I made in my first year of day trading (so you don’t have to)

B) What a ‘normal’ day actually looks like as a full-time day trader

C) Why 90% of traders quit in under 2 years (and how not to be one of them)

1nihpm1,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 09:36:43,Consistency Turns Losses Into Opportunities,"When I first started trading, I was losing more often than winning. My own family would laugh at me, saying I was just wasting my time staring at charts all day. It was tough, but I didn’t quit. I kept learning, adjusted my mistakes, and slowly built discipline.

Fast forward to today, some of those same family members who once laughed now ask me for financial help. That’s when I realized, losses were never failures, they were lessons. Every trader starts rough, but the key is staying consistent and growing through it.

That’s also why I look forward to things like the Onchain Trading Competition. Bitget recently raised the reward pool to 300 BGB (up from 200), and this round features $AVNT, $USELESS, and $TRADOOR. I’ve been trading $AVNT actively, especially with how its price has been moving lately, and the comp adds an extra layer of motivation.

I even received some $BGB rewards from the last Onchain Competition 52, so I’m jumping back in again. For me, it’s not just about the prizes, it’s about proving that the discipline I built during those tough early days is exactly what allows me to take advantage of opportunities like this now.

Losses. Lessons. Discipline. That’s what really turns the tables and right now, it’s also what makes this comp worth the grind.",3,4,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nihpm1/consistency_turns_losses_into_opportunities/,new,Discussion,0.81
1nih0vb,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 09:08:53,"Trading Memecoins Taught Me Discipline, Not Just Hype","Memecoins move fast, but for me, trading them has been less about chasing pumps and more about understanding how quickly narratives shift in the market.

When I first started looking at them, I thought it was all about timing the moonshot. The reality is, most of the time the big moves happen before you even hear about them. I learned that the hard way, jumping in late and watching positions reverse almost immediately. It was frustrating, but it also taught me a valuable lesson: don’t just follow hype, focus on risk management and execution.

Over time, I realized memecoins aren’t really about fundamentals but about sentiment, community energy, and speed. Once I accepted that, I stopped expecting them to behave like other assets and started treating them as high-volatility trades that require discipline.

Recently, I have been trading some of the newer tokens like $KOGE, $CARDS, and $TROLL, and I have been keeping myself engaged through structured challenges. One example is the Bitget Onchain Challenge Phase 18, which has a 100,000 BGB reward pool tied to trading activity. For me, it’s less about the rewards and more about having a system that keeps me consistent, accountable, and focused on the process rather than the quick wins.

That shift in mindset has made all the difference. Instead of seeing memecoins as a lottery ticket, I now see them as a testing ground for discipline, strategy, and emotional control.",5,7,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nih0vb/trading_memecoins_taught_me_discipline_not_just/,new,Strategy,0.78

1nhwks9,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 16:06:35,Why you probably should STOP NOW if you’re thinking of getting into trading,"I had everything going for me in life. But I decided what I had wasn’t paying me fast enough and I started pouring myself into trading, hoping to escape the matrix.

Fast forward 6 years, and I basically was back to even after the trump tariff scare. I knew I had to quit and I walked away.

Trading taught me basically no hard skills that were transferable to any other field.

It made me a worse person in so many ways.

It isolated me from society and people who love and care about me. It did nothing to help my social skills. It made it harder for me to stay in shape physically and eat healthily. It added insane levels of stress that I sometimes tried to eliminate in less than healthy ways.

I am grateful that God gave me another chance and I now have professional success outside the markets that came from applying myself to my field of study in school, with networking, mentorship and investment in my real business outside the markets.

In the unlikely event you do better than I did, you’re still contributing nothing to society. People will respect you less than a door to door home improvement salesman. And for good reason - society wouldn’t function if we were all trying to trade for a living. Ain’t no woman out there want to introduce her boyfriend or husband to her friends and have to tell them he trades for a living. If you so much as buy a pickup truck and start a junk hauling business, that’s better evidence of you making money than claiming you’re a trader.

Please for the love of all that’s good, don’t throw away some of the best years of your life like I did. If you’re convinced, I can’t stop you, but if you’re even marginally on the fence, please at least take some time before trying to get into this. Ask your friends and family what they honestly think, and listen to them.

1nhrbh0,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 12:54:49,Learning to Look Beyond Timing in Trading,"I’ve been chasing timing for some certain years now while always trying to get in just before the move, i was always checking if my entry could’ve been sharper. Sometimes I got it right, and it felt good, but other times it left me frustrated because the market doesn’t care about perfection. I think i have caught the spot, then watch the chart and realize there are a lot of things to reconsider. That constant chase can eat away at the joy of trading if you let it.

I felt that a lot with so many tokens $CUDIS, $USDUC etc. I wasn’t super early on them, and it bothered me at first. I thought I had lost it all, but it didn’t feel that way when I saw the volume building after I was already in. Later on, it clicked. curiosity made be  look deeper to the extent i realized people were rushing into the tokens from bitget because they are part of the required set in the phase 53 onchain trading competition. That changed the angle for me. It wasn’t about me being late now, it was about understanding why the demand suddenly stacked up and how competitions like this shape short term sentiment.

That realization made me take a step back. Instead of beating myself up about not being first, I started asking what comes after timing. Position sizing, discipline, patience, and a better deep research, those things matter more than catching the very bottom. Anyone can jump in, but it’s happened once you’re in that separates random luck from real structure. Timing can give you a head start, but focus keeps you in the race.

So now my mindset is shifting. I still care about entries, but I’m not letting them define my whole trade. I want to build habits around how I handle and research on market movements, because the market keeps proving it’s not only about who shows up first, it’s about who knows how to move when the crowd finally arrives.",3,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nhrbh0/learning_to_look_beyond_timing_in_trading/,new,Discussion,1.0

On one side the labor market is showing more cracks than expected, weaker payrolls, slower job growth, and signs that wage momentum is cooling. That would normally strengthen the case for cuts.

On the other hand, we’re still facing sticky inflation risks, Tariffs are adding pressure, oil isn’t exactly helping, and the Fed has been crystal clear that they don’t want to repeat the mistakes of cutting too early.

1nhh84q,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 05:31:38,Prop Firm Wants My MQL5 Source Code—Is This Normal?,"Hey everyone,

I've been in the software development field for over six years and have recently come across prop firms as a new way to apply my trading strategies.

I decided to start a free trial with a firm, and when I asked about their rules, I received a couple of emails.

First, their support team sent an email (see screenshot 1) saying they would enable my EA if I provided the `.EX5` and `.MQL5` files along with my account number. This immediately raised a huge red flag for me, as providing the `.MQL5` file means giving them the full source code for my strategy.

I then sent them a follow-up email explaining my setup, which is a Python bot communicating with MT5. They responded by saying they don't allow any external APIs or socket communication and that the EA must run solely within the MT5 platform. They also mentioned they've disabled all external API and socket webhook communication (see screenshot 2).

I'm trying to figure out if this is normal for the industry. My main questions for this community are:

1. **Is this a standard practice for prop firms?** Do most of them require you to submit your `.MQL5` (source code) file for review?
2. **Is it a red flag that they're asking for the** `.MQL5` **file?** It feels like I'd be giving away my entire strategy. What are the risks of doing this?
3. Do you know of any reputable prop firms that **don't** require you to hand over your source code files?

Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

	•	Could pressure $NFLX hard, finally forcing them to give up market share

	•	$WBD + $PSKY are also rumored to be circling other deals → the whole space is heating up

If $DIS throws real cash at this, $FUBO valuation could rerate overnight. Traders calling it one of the biggest potential shakeups in streaming.

1nh278g,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 16:38:04,Swing Trading in the Stock Market is Real!,"I wanted to share my experience with swing trading to show that it’s possible to build real wealth through it, even if it’s not easy. I’ve been at it for a few years now, and the results speak for themselves.


In 2023 and 2024, I averaged about 30% returns per year using a local broker. Their analytics were pretty basic—no fancy calendar views—so I can’t share screenshots from back then. 

But starting this year, I switched to Moomoo for better tools and tracking. As of this month (September 2025), I’m up around 130% YTD (refer 1st attachment). Pretty wild, right?


On top of that, I manage a family fund that’s also hit almost 30% gains, and we’ve already made some withdrawals without derailing the growth. (Refer 2nd and 3rd attachment)

A quick note: I always talk in percentages because that’s what keeps me focused and disciplined. Whenever I shift my mindset to dollar amounts, my trades start going sideways—it’s like the greed creeps in and clouds my judgment.


For anyone looking to build wealth through stock market trading, here’s my honest advice based on what I’ve learned:

1. It’s possible, but extremely difficult. Expect setbacks, and be ready to put in the work.

2. Learn as much as you can to build your own system—don’t overwhelm yourself with conflicting info. Focus on what resonates and test it.

3. You make the strategy; don’t let the strategy control you. Adapt it to your style, not the other way around.

4. Self-discovery is a big part of the game. Trading reveals your risk tolerance, emotions, and biases—use that to your advantage.

5. What works for others might not work for you. Experiment, track results, and refine relentlessly.


Just remember, this isn’t financial advice—do your own research.

1ngw28u,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 12:40:40,Why does it take many years to become profitable with trading?,"Hi traders. Im still quite new to trading (trading for only 6 months now). And before i get into this question, I am not claiming to be profitable or nearly there yet, I just wanna know what it takes.

Why does it take most people 3+ years to be profitable when trading is said to be better when it is simplified? In my eyes, the main things you need to be successful are: 

\- A strategy that has been extensively backtested that is proven to work

\- Good risk management

\- The psychological aspect of trading where you objectively follows the rules of your trading plan and not let your emotions impact how you execute and manage trades.

The way i see it: finding a working strategy with good risk management shouldnt take too long if you have enough time. A strategy can be backtested over 12 months within 2 days of being on fxreplay. so theoretically if you have time to you could backtest around 10 strategy variations a month. Forward testing can happen as time goes by.

I understand for some the psychology aspect may take a while to master, but lets say that someone has little emotional decision making from the start and has a vast understanding that trading involves losing as well, you just need a good RR, even though your win rate is less than 50%.

  
Taking into account all the above, I dont see why it cant take someone about a year to become profitable?

I’m still learning and quite new to backtesting, so I’d like to ask how you usually do it on TradingView.
	•	Do you use a split screen with two charts (for example one on Daily and the other on lower timeframes)?
→ And if you do it this way, can you go from Daily all the way down to the 1-minute chart without problems?
	•	Or do you prefer to backtest using just one chart and switch timeframes as you go?

I’ve tried starting from the Daily and then moving down to the 1-minute, which works fine. But when I go the other way around (from lower TF back to higher), TradingView shows me the future candles and that ruins the replay. For my backtesting I really need to move from lower to higher TF to check the overall context without spoiling it.

Do you have any tips or better methods for handling this?

The 5-6 percent may sound great, but I'm not satisfied with this win rate after getting stressed all the month , SO my question is to the PRofitable ONes is this what profitability looks like or is there are strategies I can't find out with  >45-50% winning rate with 1:3 , I have tested these strategies with different risk reward tooo but they can't even get to breakeven ..... WHat should I dooo , help me .... Will i learn things deeply taking my time and should not stress now..?

I have a win rate of 48,7% with an average win of 15,77% and average loss of 3,64% (6% expectancy) Every trade I take goes through a tight screening process, after of which I do my manual research on the fundamentals and then use some technical analysis on the entry. I've been religious about following the strategy and working like a robot inside the parameters I have given myself in terms of risk management and not deviating from the strategy.

I've felt extremely confident in every trade I've taken because I finally feel like I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. (this was not the case when I was experimenting with day trading).

The only problem is I only have 40 trades taken. I take about 3-5 trades a month and I hold for about 2-5 weeks. Can I feel confident or is there a high chance that this is just some lucky streak. I would like to allocate some more capital to this since I finally feel like I've understood what it takes to be profitable, but I'm not sure if I should still wait until I have close to 100 trades taken.",13,13,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ngslpl/i_think_im_finally_getting_it/,new,Discussion,0.88

First of all let me just post a few images to make it clear that i am not wasting ur time!

Its been a while since me & my dad had been looking out for a company that could help us invest somewhere , when i got advised by my cousin to start trading with the help of a company which provided trading bots, i was very suspicious like anyone would be😅
But i went ahead and observed what my cousin did for a month and IT WAS LEGIT AF, 
I discussed it with my dad, long story short we invested 10 lakh pkr into it (atleast 3000$ is minimum, but 5000$ is safe it prevents tension of liquidation) 
And we are trading in USDCAD, all it requires is a basic knowledge of how the trades work, and just a lot of patience, the bot is designed to wait till the total trade goes +ve to cutt off all the trades, it takes trades on its own sometimes sell sometimes buy and holds it, and Alhamdulillah it makes around 300$ smth a week, half of which goes to the company like 150$, and the rest is ours
I have helped a friend get into this business as well and we are doing pretty good,

While my charts may seem confusing at first glance, there are resources on my personal channel explaining my system and how to trade it.

For here though, I will keep it simple and highlight potential key areas and levels for the coming week.

Red 1M and Orange 1W chart:

Bulls still fully in control at the top of the structure breaking above the 1M overextension zone, the 1W overextension zone now rests at 6690 for the coming week.

Yellow 1D and Green 4H chart:

Finding support here in the entry zone of the Yellow 1D bull structure with lots of pin reversals in this area the last few weeks showing buyers stepping in.

The confluence around 6690 for the FOMC date I mentioned last week is very much in play.  We also have a confluence of support down at 6405 that could come into play to the downside.

As I mentioned previously, any time there is a confluence like this around an important news event I will pay particular attention too it.

I also mentioned last week, the ability to identify a future time and price point makes for a lucrative opportunity using Options.  

Being that we have both a long and short confluence and the impending news event, makes a perfect opportunity for an OTM straddle near our targets.  

I may do a separate forward test entirely around option strategies after the conclusion of this one if there is any interest.


Blue 1H and Purple 15m chart:

We are nearing overextension on the bull structure of both timeframes.  For this reason I am switching to a near term short bias into FOMC, and even after if we do get a blowoff into overextension and a new ATH ZI still expect a sizable sell off to follow.

Holding some shorts on the intraday account from the 6600 level which I should be out of before the announcement on Wednesday.

In the near term would look to re-enter long around the 6515 level stop outside of structure at 6465 targeting ATH 6615 R:R 2",1,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngm29g,new,Technical analysis,1.0

Red 1M and Orange 1W chart:

Bulls still fully in control at the top of the chart, pushing deeper into overextension on both timeframes toward that 4000 hyperextension level.

Yellow 1D and Green 4H chart:

Pushing deeper into overextension now on the 1D and deep in hyperextension on the 4H.

Our short bias kept us profitable all week with some nice sell offs from what is now appearing to be a local ceiling around the 3700 level.

If this level tests again I would guess we break toward a new ATH, but for a long I am still waiting on a deeper selloff to the 3600 area.  

Realistically I would like for us to test deeper to 3450 but I will have switched my bias back long way before then.

Blue 1H and Purple 15m chart:

We've fallen back into no mans land on the Blue 1H bull structure, we have some new Purple 15 bear structure developing again would not look to it for short entries more of a target/overextension structure.

Will be looking to re-enter long here from the 1H bull entry zone.

Yellow 1D and Green 4H chart:

I do have an upward bias but a clean break of the structure would definitely bring the 59 level in play by the end of the week as this area has been tested through several times now.

Blue 1H and Purple 15m chart:

We have some Blue 1H bear structure forming, but I wouldn't look to it for a short until a clean break of our Green 4H bull structure.  

Too early for any Purple 15m structure with all of the volatility toward the end of the week.

1nik9y3,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 11:14:20,"5 years of trading, my best tips","I’ve been day trading full-time for about 5 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up accounts, had winning streaks, and gone through phases where I thought I finally “figured it out” only to get humbled the next week. If you’re just getting into this, I’ll save you a lot of pain by sharing the biggest lessons I wish someone drilled into me early on.

1. Risk management is everything.

This is the hill most beginners die on. It doesn’t matter how good your strategy looks, how many indicators you stack on your chart, or how many “conviction trades” you think you’ve found... if you don’t have strict risk rules, the market will clean you out. Always know your max risk per trade. For most people, that’s around 1–2% of your account balance. It sounds boring, but it’s the only thing that keeps you alive long enough to actually learn.

The temptation to “average down” or hold losers is massive when you’re new. You’ll convince yourself that a stock “has to bounce” or “can’t go any lower,” and then watch it tank another 10%. Every trader who’s lasted has their scars from ignoring stop losses. Treat capital like ammo; you only get so much of it, and wasting it on stubbornness will take you out of the game fast.

2. Don’t overtrade.

One of the biggest mistakes I see (and made myself) is thinking you need to be in a trade all the time. The reality is most of the market is just noise. The edge comes from waiting for the handful of clean setups each week that actually make sense. Some of my best months have come from taking fewer than 20 trades total.

It feels counterintuitive at first. You think, “If I’m not in a trade, I’m not making money.” But that’s backwards. By forcing trades, you’re just paying commissions, racking up losses, and burning mental energy. A huge skill in day trading is learning to sit on your hands until your setup appears. That patience is where consistency comes from.

3. Journaling changes the game.

I used to think journaling was pointless. Then I realized most of my losing trades weren’t about the strategy at all; they were about me. When you actually write down why you entered, why you exited, and what you were feeling at the time, patterns start to appear. You might notice you revenge trade after a loss, or that you take bad setups when you’re bored.

Your trading journal becomes your mirror. It forces you to face the truth instead of lying to yourself with hindsight. Over time, it’s less about “what did the chart do” and more about “why did I react this way.” That self-awareness is where growth happens, and without it, you’ll keep repeating the same mistakes.

4. Keep your setup simple.

When you’re new, you want to believe the answer is some secret indicator or complex strategy nobody else knows. So you start stacking indicators until your chart looks like Times Square. I went through that phase too. But after years of testing, I came back to the basics: clean price action, volume, and maybe one or two moving averages. That’s it.

The market isn’t hiding anything from you. Overcomplication just creates decision paralysis. The pros aren’t out here with 15 indicators... they’re reading levels, momentum, and supply/demand zones. Keep your charts clean, focus on setups you can repeat, and you’ll save yourself years of frustration.

5. Protect your mental health.

Trading will wreck you if you let it. If you’re risking rent money or grocery money, you’re trading scared, and scared traders make terrible decisions. You’ll cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and constantly feel like your back’s against the wall. That’s not trading, that’s gambling under pressure.

Detach yourself from the outcome of any single trade. This is easier said than done, but the only way to do it is by trading money you can afford to lose and keeping size small until you’re consistent. If a red day ruins your mood for 24 hours, you’re too emotionally tied to your positions. Protect your headspace first; the money follows when you’re calm.

6. Learn from screen time, not YouTube gurus.

There’s a ton of content online, but no video or course will replace actually watching the market tick by tick. You need screen time to understand how price moves, how news impacts volatility, and how momentum builds and fades. That “intuition” you see in experienced traders doesn’t come from books, it comes from thousands of hours watching patterns unfold live.

Don’t get me wrong, you can pick up useful basics from videos. But the real learning happens when you put skin in the game, track your trades, and experience the emotions firsthand. Nobody can teach you how you react to fear and greed, that’s something only screen time reveals.

7. Consistency > home runs.

The biggest misconception beginners have is thinking they need a massive trade to “make it.” They see screenshots of 10k days on Twitter and start chasing jackpots. The truth is, most accounts blow up because people swing for the fences. Survival in this game comes from small, consistent wins while keeping losses tiny.

A steady $100 a day, compounded, crushes the guy who tries to make $1,000 in one shot and wipes half his account. The math is simple, but the ego makes it hard to follow. Focus on consistency, build confidence, and scale later. Day trading is a marathon of small edges, not a lottery ticket.

Bottom line.

Day trading isn’t easy. Most people fail not because they can’t read charts, but because they underestimate how much discipline, patience, and emotional control it really takes. If you treat this like a craft instead of a get-rich-quick scheme, you’ll give yourself a real shot.

I really like this community so plan on doing more write-ups like these as a mini education series. If you guys want, my next one can be about 

A) The biggest mistakes I made in my first year of day trading (so you don’t have to)

B) What a ‘normal’ day actually looks like as a full-time day trader

C) Why 90% of traders quit in under 2 years (and how not to be one of them)

1nos48l,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 16:15:49,3 years of trading: The brutal lessons I wish someone told me sooner,"I’ve been trading seriously for about 3 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up small accounts, overleveraged, revenge-traded, and gone through the cycle of overconfidence → humility → back to square one. I’m not a guru, I’m not here to sell you anything. I just want to share the lessons that actually stuck with me, because I wish I had internalized these from day one.

1. Risk management isn’t optional it’s survival

Everyone says “risk management matters” but you don’t really understand it until you blow up a few accounts. The truth is, you can have a 40–50% win rate and still be profitable if your winners are bigger than your losers. But if you don’t cap your risk per trade (1–2% of account size), you’re basically playing Russian roulette. One stubborn “this has to bounce” moment can erase months of progress.

2. The market doesn’t reward effort it rewards discipline

I used to believe that the harder I studied, the more setups I should be able to find. Wrong. Most days, there’s nothing worth trading. Some of my best weeks came from taking only 3–4 trades total. Sitting on your hands feels lazy at first, but the reality is: trading more doesn’t equal earning more. It usually equals bleeding more.

3. Overcomplication is a trap

In my first year, my charts looked like a Christmas tree: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci levels, you name it. I thought the “secret” was hidden in some magical indicator combination. After testing for months, I came back to basics: clean levels, volume, and price action. Most pros I’ve observed keep it shockingly simple because clutter breeds hesitation, and hesitation costs money.

4. Journaling turned me from “random clicking” into an actual trader

I resisted journaling for the longest time. Felt tedious. But when I finally did it, patterns jumped out: I overtraded after losses, I closed winners too early when I was scared, I took dumb setups when I was bored. None of that was visible on my P&L alone. Writing down the why behind each trade gave me brutal but necessary feedback.

5. Trading will expose your psychology faster than anything else

The market is the best mirror you’ll ever have. If you’re impatient in life, you’ll overtrade. If you’re stubborn, you’ll refuse to cut losers. If you’re greedy, you’ll size up too soon. I used to think trading was about charts now I know it’s mostly about emotional control. If you don’t fix your mindset, no strategy will save you.

6. You don’t need to “quit your job” to be a trader

This one took me a while. I used to idolize the idea of being a “full-time trader” with no other income. The truth ? Having a second income stream actually helps you trade better, because you’re not desperate for every single trade to pay your bills. Desperation makes you reckless. A job or side hustle gives you breathing room, which translates into better decisions.

7. Consistency > jackpots

My biggest trap was thinking I needed one massive trade to “make it.” The truth is, trading is about grinding out small, consistent gains while keeping losses tiny. A steady +$100 a day is infinitely more powerful (and sustainable) than swinging for +$1,000 and wiping out half your account.",757,111,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nos48l/3_years_of_trading_the_brutal_lessons_i_wish/,month,Advice,0.97
1nfobfw,2025-09-13,2025-09-13 00:32:17,I make a living with a 40-50% win rate,"I didn’t leave my 9-5 because I found a magic 80% win strategy. My journal shows 58.26% green days, a typical day wins bigger than it loses (avg daily win/loss 1.17), and I’m done in about 4h18m on average. Biggest up day: $5,387.50. Biggest down day: -$2,015.25.

*Processing img duzroav91vof1...*

Nothing glamorous, also note that still to this day, trading **is NOT** the only source of income I have, it is advised to have at least one more, for youre safety and sanity.

What I actually trade and how it performs:

ES: 40% win rate, $13,637.50 net, avg win $695.97 vs avg loss -$317.34 (\~2.2x payoff).

NQ: 52.11% win rate, $14,215 net, avg win $794.86 vs avg loss -$446.91 (\~1.8x payoff).

MES: 36.84% win rate, $917.50 net.

MNQ: 37.04% win rate, -$1,438.50 net (I cut it, noise for me).

RTY: 27.91% win rate, $1,960 net.

*Processing img j0q5ltv81vof1...*

The lesson: you don’t need a sky-high win rate if your average winner is meaningfully larger than your loser and you focus on the symbols that actually pay you.

My playbook is simple and strict. I trade a smart money concepts: wait for alignment (bias + structure), then pull the trigger only on A-setups. For index futures that means things like SMT between ES/NQ, reclaim through key levels, and clean breaks of strcuturee ofter a liquidity sweep. Early in a cycle I’ll size conservatively and let one or two quality trades build a buffer, then I protect that buffer like my paycheck. It’s boring but boring compounds.

If you’re trying to make the jump: track your real numbers, cut the instruments that drain you, and let the payoff ratio do the heavy lifting.

1n8ukqz,2025-09-04,2025-09-04 23:24:01,Lessons From a 7-Figure Trader (28R in August),"My mentor just wrapped up one of his best months this quarter, 28R net in August. He’s a 7-figure trader and what stood out to me wasn’t the P&L, but the principles he keeps hammering into me. I wanted to share them here because I know some of you are grinding through the same lessons.

https://preview.redd.it/7oxducf5l9nf1.jpg?width=990&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58d5c36d6af8abefb989ce4182e4aac18a035ef4

 

**1.Discipline beats “activity.”**

He didn’t take every setup under the sun. Only A+ plays. No random entries. The month was built on conviction trades he’s backtested a thousand times. Mostly focused on **$TSLA, $HOOD, $SNOW**

**2. Risk management creates freedom.**

A profit factor of 2.37 and a win/loss ratio near 3:1 didn’t happen by chance. He sized in only when risk was capped and stayed consistent with losers. His drawdowns were controlled, which kept him in the game. Only one small red week gives him confidence even more while he is already very green for the month.

**3. Know what works, know what doesn’t.**

Directional auctions and failed breakdowns worked beautifully. Range setups? Liquidity sweeps destroyed them. He doubled down on strengths and is already refining the weak spots.

**4. Leave money on the table? Good problem.**

His biggest critique of himself was not letting winners run. That says it all. Losing days were managed. Big days left untapped gains. It’s a reminder: you’re better off leaving money on the table than bleeding it back.

**5. Don’t force sync.**

If the market feels “off,” step away. Taking breaks is part of being consistent. Trading through chop only burns capital and confidence. (This is a part I struggled with heavily myself, trading feels like a drug sometimes, even though I say I won't trade, 5min later you find me in a trade.)

September game plan (the part I’m adopting too):

Review losing days deeply. Was it the setup, execution, or just market noise?

Only trade data-backed edges. Nothing else.

Focus on conviction: if the thesis isn’t clear, don’t touch it.

Accept missed trades. Missing is cheap, forcing is expensive.

I think the biggest lesson for me is that trading is not about catching every move, it’s about catching your move. The setups you know, the plays you trust, the risks you’re willing to take.

1nkhybe,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 15:33:31,Trading Is the Hardest Thing I’ve Ever Done,"

I grew up in a small town in Mexico. My parents worked jobs that barely kept food on the table, and from a young age, I knew if I wanted something more, I’d have to figure it out myself. At 19, I crossed the border with nothing but a backpack, a few clothes, and a dream of building a better life.

I washed dishes, stocked shelves overnight, and sent money home when I could. I shared a one-bedroom apartment with three other guys just to cover rent. Some weeks I worked 70–80 hours, only to end up with barely enough left to buy groceries. It was exhausting, but I kept telling myself, “This is temporary, justy keep moving.”

Then I discovered amazon FBA, failed. Dropshipping, failed and then finallly trading. I thought it would be my escape, finally a way to use my brain instead of my back. I opened a brokerage account, put in a few thousand dollars, and thought I could flip it fast. I lost it all in less than two months. The frustration was unreal. I felt like I was running in circles: breaking my body at work, then burning through savings at night chasing green candles.

But I didn’t quit. I slowed down and started studying. I found futures and realized this was a real profession, not a shortcut. I backtested for months. I journaled every mistake. I cut my size to the smallest possible and focused on surviving first. Slowly, things started to click. My first payout from a prop firm wasn’t big, just $1,000 but it felt like the world to me. It proved I wasn’t crazy for believing I could do this.

Here’s what trading taught me: it’s not a hustle, it’s a mirror. It shows you every weakness and impatience, ego, greed and forces you to deal with them. That’s why it’s harder than any job I’ve ever worked. Because it doesn’t just demand skill; it demands you to change who you are.

Today, I’m not rich, but I’m consistent. I can finally say I trade with confidence. I still send money home. I still live simply. But I built this life from nothing, and that’s something no one can take from me.

And if there’s one thing I know for sure:

It will give you grounded insights into how markets work, market efficiencies, trading psychology, reasoning, the declining effectiveness of public strategies (alpha decay), and much more.

This post covers just about everything. This isn't a generic resources dump this has been carefully picked for optimal absorption.

# Academic and Institutional Studies & Serious Books

**This document is for anyone curious about the reasoning behind our process and thinking, or for those seeking deep trading knowledge.**

***Pause and read when something piques your interest. Judge by citation.***

**1. Random Walk & Market Efficiency**

**Eugene Fama - THE BEHAVIOR OF STOCK-MARKET PRICES**

**Key Part:**

“By contrast the theory of random walks says that the future path of the price level of a security is no more predictable than the path of a series of cumulated random numbers. In statistical terms the theory says that successive price changes are independent, identically distributed random variables. Most simply this implies that the series of price changes has no memory, that is, the past cannot be used to predict the future in any meaningful way”

**Note:**  
We are not suggesting the market is 100% efficient/random. We referenced this to show how randomness in a market isn’t good for your bottom line. The more efficient/random a market is the harder it is to trade profitably

**Eugene Fama - Random Walks in Stock Market Prices.**

**Key Takeaway:**

if the random-walk theory is an accurate description of reality, then the various “technical” or “chartist” procedures for predicting stock prices are completely without value.

 

**Burton Malkiel - A Random Walk Down Wall Street**

**Key Lines:**

“A random walk is one in which future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past history. When the term is applied to the stock market, it means that short-run changes in stock prices are unpredictable”

“Mathematicians call a sequence of numbers produced by a random process (such as those on our simulated stock chart) a random walk. The next move on the chart is completely unpredictable on the basis of what has happened before.” – **Referencing Random Candlestick Charts**

[A Random Chart](https://preview.redd.it/vub60qytg4sf1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d82d67028281adb41fc414a6e4cc7c8c85bfa2d)

[Another random chart designed to look like S&P 500 Futures \(ES\)](https://preview.redd.it/bl1fhs0wg4sf1.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=714b9c45ad9d847d4ecf8559d79ea41bb4449868)

**The core lesson of the random‐walk theory is that you cannot predict future market price movements by studying historical data if the market is 100% random.**

 

**2. Alpha/Market Edge Decay & Why no profitable trader would sell or give away their strategy for free.\[1\]**

**Julien Penasse - Understanding Alpha Decay**

 

**Highlights that alpha (edge over market) tends to diminish. alpha decay is generally a nonstationary phenomenon/inconsistent. Julien leverages studied anomalies for credibility.**

**Key Parts:** “Because alpha decay is generally a non-stationary phenomenon, asset pricing tests that impose stationarity may lead to biased inference. I illustrate the importance of alpha decay using the most commonly-studied anomalies in the asset pricing literature”

“Alpha decay refers to the reduction in abnormal expected returns (relative to an asset pricing model) in response to an anomaly becoming widely known among market participants” **\[1\]**

 

**This is popular, modern and potent evidence that alpha decay and edge decay is real.**

**Does Academic Research Destroy Stock Return Predictability? - Journal of Finance, R. David McLean**

**Published in 2016**

**Key takeaway:**

“Portfolio returns are 26% lower out-of-sample and 58% lower post-publication. The out-of-sample decline is an upper bound estimate of data mining effects. We estimate a 32% (58% - 26%) lower return from publication-informed trading.”

 

**On the Effect of Alpha Decay and Transaction Costs on the Multi-period Optimal Trading Strategy** by Chutian Ma and Paul Smith (2025):

The approach shown on this paper captures the essence of alpha decay by allowing the strength of signals to wane as they age, reflecting reality where the effectiveness of trading signals decrease over time. Re-enforcing the idea of edge / alpha decay.

Present in the ABSTRACT: **“To simulate alpha decay, we consider a case where not only the present value of a signal, but also past values, have predictive power”**

**3. Intraday Seasonality & Session‐Based Rules**

**Admati & Pfleiderer - A Theory of Intraday Patterns**

**Key Parts:**

Paper documents intraday volume & volatility U‐shape across NYSE hours.

Ex Table 1 show how volume and volatility vary through NYSE hours.

**4. Mean Reversion vs. Trending Characterization**

**Intraday mean-reversion after open shocks: Grant, Wolf, and Yu (2005) document strong reversal effects in US equity index futures**

**Key Lines:**

This paper gives a long-term assessment of intraday price reversals in the US stock index futures market following large price changes at the market open. We find highly significant intraday price reversals over a 15-year period (November 1987-September 2002) as well as significant intraday reversals in our yearly and day-of-the-week investigations. Moreover, the strength of the intraday overreaction phenomenon seems more pronounced following large positive price changes at the market open.

 That being said, the question of whether a trader can consistently profit from this information remains open as the significance of intraday price reversals is sharply reduced when gross trading results are adjusted by a bid-ask proxy for transactions costs.

 

**Rama Cont - Empirical Properties of Asset Returns**

**Key Lines:**

Table 1 lists “Volatility Clustering” and “Gain/loss asymmetry” i.e Mean reversion characteristics for major indices.

 

**5. Backtesting**

**Bailey, López de Prado & Zhu - Pseudo‐Mathematics and Financial Charlatanism**

**Key Lines**

We prove that high simulated performance is easily achievable after backtesting a relatively small number of alternative strategy configurations, a practice we denote ‘backtest overfitting

The higher the number of configurations tried, the greater is the probability that the backtest is overfit... Under memory effects, backtest overfitting leads to negative expected returns out-of-sample, rather than zero performance.

**6. Order Flow, Microstructure and how markets work**

**Albert S. Kyle - Continuous Auctions and Insider Trading**

**Key Lines for us:**

**Albert S. Kyle** “Perhaps the most interesting properties concern the liquidity characteristics of the market in a continuous auction equilibrium. ""Market liquidity"" is a slippery and elusive concept, in part because it encompasses a number of transactional properties of markets. These include ""tightness"" (the cost of turning around a position over a short period of time), ""depth"" (the size of an order flow innovation required to change prices a given amount), and ""resiliency"" (the speed with which prices recover from a random, uninformative shock). Black \[2\] describes intuitively a liquid market in the following manner: ""The market for a stock is liquid if the following conditions hold: (1) There are always bid and asked prices for the investor who wants to buy or sell small amounts of stock immediately. (2) The difference between the bid and asked prices (the spread) is always small”

Kyle breaks down what Market liquidity is and What makes a market liquid showing that imbalances between buyers and sellers i.e. imbalance in liquidity is the reason why price moves. To us this is obvious but many traders don’t consider it.

 

**Trading and Exchange: Market microstructure for practitioners - Larry Harris**

Parts 1.5, 3.10, and 3.11 were well written and more on point; Part 3.12 is an amusing read too.

It’s a lot less intense when comparing to market microstructure theory, and he uses humorous terms which keep things engaging, making it a nice gateway.

**The most dense book I’ve ever explored.**

This book is intense; it goes into legitimately everything that you’d ever need to know about order flow mechanics, microstructure facts and more. It’s straight-up excessive and worth every penny.  Citing the book here saves this document from being 100+ pages.

Lauren A Leotti 1, Sheena S Iyengar, Kevin N Ochsner

The innate feeling of needing to be in control of outcome in human psychology (The root of most trading pain & desire for discretion in trading)

**Present in the ABSTRACT:**

""Belief in one's ability to exert control over the environment and to produce desired results is essential for an individual's wellbeing. It has repeatedly been argued that perception of control is not only desirable, but is also probably a psychological and biological necessity. In this article, we review the literature supporting this claim and present evidence of a biological basis for the need for control and for choice-that is, the means by which we exercise control over the environment. Converging evidence from animal research, clinical studies and neuroimaging suggests that the need for control is a biological imperative for survival, and a corticostriatal network is implicated as the neural substrate of this adaptive behavior.""

\- For context from Ron: Total Return Swaps (TRS) and Contract for Difference (CFDs) are similar in that both allow you to gain exposure to an asset’s price changes/performance without owning it outright. You benefit from price changes and, depending on the contract & type even receive or pay income like dividends or interest. Both involve paying financing costs if you hold positions overnight (swap fees)

# Definitions written by Ali (SentientAnalyzer)

**1.Constraints**

What limits you - time, capital, lifestyle. These set the boundaries for what you can actually trade. Your system must respect them.

**2. Market Type**

Behaviour of a market: mean reverting, trending, or random/alternating.

**3. Valid Trading Window**

The hours when you’re allowed to trade. Based on where volume and volatility are, not your convenience.

**4. Risk (R)**

The set amount of capital you’re willing to lose per trade. Fixed, consistent. Example: 1R = 3%.

**5. RRR**

Risk-to-reward ratio (e.g. 1:3 = risk $100 to make $300).

**6. Order-Flow Mechanics**

Price moves because buyers and sellers are imbalanced. That’s it. It explains rejections and moves - it’s not an edge, it’s just reality.

**7. 3-Wick Setup**

Three wicks rejecting a level - signals price has repeated selling activity and won’t break through. Must be rule-based, not subjective.

**8. Tick**

The smallest price increment on an instrument.

**9. Execution**

Cost Spreads, commissions, and slippage affecting net performance. Ignore it and your edge vanishes.

**10. Backtest**

Testing your rules on past data. Done honestly - no scrolling, no cherrypicking, no hindsight. Bar Replay below in

**11. Overfitting**

When your strategy works only on the past because you’ve shaped it to work on past historical data instead of applying and idea to historical data. Looks good in testing, fails live.

**12. Stress Test**

Deliberately run your system in bad conditions. These are notable periods of intraday chop, low volume on trend trading strategies and periods of relentless trends on mean reversion/reversal strategies. If it collapses, it’s weak.

Example: Someone could be running a mean reversion day trading system on YM and he could stress test August 8th to September 13th 2024 as an example, where, here Dow Jones exhibited strong trending behaviour which is against the system’s nature.

**13. Bar Replay Play**

charts forward candle by candle to mimic real-time. Helps you test if you’d actually take your setups live. E.g., TradingView Bar Replay

**14. Scaling In**

Adding size after entry. Must be planned and tested - not just done because “it looks good”.

**15. Hedge**

Open a position benefiting from movements in the opposite direction. Useful at times, but messy if you don’t have clear rules.

**16. Breakeven/Partials**

Closing part/all of the trade early. Often reduces long-term edge unless justified by data.

**17. Ghost Liquidity**

Orders that aren’t visible but sit around visible levels. Cause sharp reactions or none at all. It’s just a surge of liquidity that isn’t visible on the books.

**18. Random Walk**

Price sometimes moves like noise. Most patterns don’t work unless they’re backed by logic. A Random Walk is a market that is 100% random. In other words, it is effectively a completely efficient market where no edge is possible. Real markets are of course different.

**19. Bracketed Limit Orders**

Pre-set entry, stop, and take-profit. Forces discipline. Removes intuition and discretion.

**20. Institutional Narrative Fallacy**

The idea that “smart money” always leaves clues. Usually marketing fluff. If it’s not testable, it’s not valid.

**21. Data Snooping**

Repeatedly looking at a data series from different angles to confirm something that you haven’t defined ahead of time often leading to insignificant and/or biased discoveries. Essentially looking too hard for patterns and finding things that don’t actually repeat. Typically kills forward performance.

**22. Drawdown**

How far your strategy drops from peaks in tests. Crucial for knowing how big your positions should be in advance. For example, a trader could have a max losing streak of 8 but your peak to trough could be 12x your risk (some wins followed by strings of losses repeatedly create this) – Super important to track and know. That’s the maximum drawdown you should be taking into account especially if working with prop firms.

**23. Dynamic Targeting**

Set targets based on real market structure - swing highs, lows, clusters of wicks. not arbitrary price movements e.g., 100 points, 100 handles, 100 pips, 100 ticks. Market is too dynamic for a one size fits all.

**24. Expectancy**

The average gain or loss per trade. Strategies don’t need high win rates - it needs consistency in the data and logical backing: Expectancy = average win × win rate − (1 − win rate) × average loss.

**25. Logic-Driven Rule** A rule built on how the market behaves - not what a shape on a chart looks like or some untested theory. For example purposes only, using the 3 wicks example. Bar 1 closes with a wick high; this shows that there was selling pressure. If the next candle interacts with bar 1’s high but fails to close above, creating another wick, it shows continued selling pressure. If on bar 3 it happens again, it shows compounded selling pressure. If it reverses, it should do so quickly. If price continues beyond the wicks, price should continue trending. Using a small stop loss relative to the target can create an edge if costs are managed properly.

I am in the 8 figure range. Besides 2020 and a handful of crazy weeks, most weeks felt smooth. Would’ve never thought I’d reach these heights. Find your niche and stick to it. Surprisingly what helped me most in trading was when I learned to count cards in blackjack. It taught me so much discipline because of how boring it was but it was working and seeing cold hard cash in my hands made it more realistic. I sat at tables placing fixed bets and I was able to see all the swings and craziness that made me realize anything can happen. I once lost 27 hands in a row which I just couldn’t believe. Because of this I nailed prioritizing risk management and capital preservation. Consistency consistency consistency. I was once a gambling degenerate for 1-2 years and lost tons of money. I was never afraid to take the risk and LOVED the volatility. Was a bag holder for 8 months which lowered my average by a lot but bounced back well and became even better because I learned I can cut a big loss and make it back within a few months.",237,122,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nagh2e/selling_puts_and_calls_officially_retiring_next/,month,Stocks,0.82

But instead of quitting, I treated it as a career and realized trading was bigger than charts. It humbled me and forced me to rebuild discipline in every area of life: gym, diet, faith, mindset, sleep, habits. Without those, I couldn’t stay consistent on the charts.

Now, I’m not rich, and I don’t pretend to be a guru. But I’ve had a few payouts already, and more importantly, I’ve proven to myself that consistency outside trading directly impacts results inside trading.

I’m planning to start documenting this journey publicly. Not signals, not “get rich quick,” just the real process of building discipline, faith, and trading together.

1nmx0to,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 12:50:01,5 Years In: The Advice I Wish Someone Gave Me On Day One,"I’ve been trading full-time for  2 years, started trading 5 years ago. Along the way, I’ve blown accounts, passed and lost prop firm challenges, had incredible months, and then been humbled the very next week. I primarily trade futures and stocks, but these lessons apply no matter what market you’re in.



1) Fewer Trades, Better Trades

My worst periods came from feeling like I needed to be in the market constantly. The reality is that most price action is just noise, or at least noise to YOU. The edge shows up only a handful of times each week. My best months came from taking fewer than 20 trades and letting the rest pass.



2) Keep Your Playbook Simple

When I started, my charts looked like Times Square, indicators stacked everywhere. That only led to hesitation and confusion. What finally worked was cutting it all down to a short, boring playbook: clean levels, liquidity cues, structure, and a couple of repeatable entries. Same markets, same times, same setups. Very very boring, which is good in the markets.



3) Risk First, Always

Every account I destroyed had the same cause: I ignored risk and moved stops, oversized or tried to “let it work.” Now I define my maximum loss per trade and per day. I place my stop where the trade is invalid and respect it. Capital is ammunition, you only get so much. Don’t waste it trying to prove you’re right. Also one of the reasons I could not make it in options trading is because yyou just never know the exact amount you can make.



4) Journaling Is Where Growth Happens

I used to think bad days were random. Journaling proved otherwise. When I started logging my trades with context, entry, exit, and emotions, patterns became obvious. I was revenge trading after losses, taking boredom trades late in the morning, and cutting winners during news. Writing it down forced me to face the truth and improve. I started with manual journaling but then moved to software years later because when you just write down stuff in your notebook, its really hard for the stats or the lessons you need to see to be availble to you quickly.



5) Protect Your Headspace

Trading money you can’t afford to lose is a fast way to ruin both your account and your mental health. If your rent or grocery money is on the line, you will cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and chase bad setups. Trade small, separate trading capital from living expenses, and make sure red days don’t control your mood for 24 hours.



6) Screen Time Beats Guru Time

Videos and books can teach you the basics, but real progress comes from watching price move in real time, replaying sessions, and backtesting your setups. Intuition isn’t luck, it’s thousands of hours of screen time.



7) Base Hits Beat Home Runs

Chasing the one big trade is what ruined me early on. Consistency is what built my account. A steady $200-300 a day compounds into far more than swinging for $5K and blowing up when you’re wrong. The small, repeatable wins are what keep you in the game long enough to scale. I started with making $20-40 a day or a trade I should say, and slowly sizing up, then gaining more capital and copy tading these smaller trades accross plenty accounts.



Bottom Line

Trading isn’t about finding a secret strategy. It’s about building a clear playbook, respecting risk, journaling your execution, and protecting your mindset. Once you do those things consistently, confidence stops being a feeling and becomes a fact backed by your data.



I’d like to continue doing write-ups like this if it helps the community. For my next post, I can go deeper into:

1nqij5e,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 17:01:37,"What Losing $72,000 Taught Me About Trading","

I don’t post this to flex or to get sympathy. I’m posting this because every trader at some point hits a wall, and for me that wall cost $72,117. Looking back at those trades, I learned more from that drawdown than from any winning streak I’ve ever had. If you’re in this game, I hope what I share here saves you time, money, and a few blown accounts.

1. Risk management isn’t a suggestion
When I dug into those losses, the biggest mistake wasn’t the setups themselves. It was that I had no consistent risk plan. Sometimes I’d risk $200, sometimes $2,000, depending on how “confident” I felt. Confidence is not risk management. Without a fixed risk per trade, every loss compounds unpredictably. The number that stood out most to me wasn’t the -$72K. It was the 13 consecutive losses. With proper risk sizing, that stretch should have been frustrating, not account-ending.

2. Losing streaks reveal the truth about your process.
It’s easy to feel like a genius when trades are going your way. You start to believe the market “makes sense” and you’ve got it figured out. A real losing streak exposes whether you have an actual system or if you’re just winging it. During those 13 red trades in a row, I realized I didn’t have a defined playbook. I had “ideas” and “feelings”  but nothing I could consistently execute. If you can’t clearly write down your setup, your entry/exit criteria, and your risk rules, you don’t have a strategy. You have hope.

3. The psychological spiral is real.
After a string of red trades, my instinct was to “make it back.” That’s when I started oversizing, taking lower-quality setups, and ignoring my stops. Every losing trader knows this spiral, but very few actually put systems in place to stop it. What I should have done was step away after 3 losses, reset, and review. Instead, I traded through it and bled out. Discipline isn’t about avoiding emotions, it’s about building rules that protect you from yourself when those emotions hit.

4. Journaling turns pain into progress.
The $72K wasn’t wasted because I documented every single one of those trades. I tracked context, entries, exits, and what was going through my head. Patterns became obvious: I was most reckless after 10:30 AM, I entered early instead of waiting for confirmation, and I risked more after a loss. Without journaling, I would’ve walked away with nothing but regret. With it, I built the foundation of my current process.

Losing money doesn’t make you a bad trader. Refusing to learn from it does. If you’re new, don’t wait until you’re $72,000 down to respect risk, build a playbook, and journal your execution. If you’ve already taken big losses, don’t waste them  extract every lesson you can and let the data, not your emotions, shape your next chapter.",175,46,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nqij5e/what_losing_72000_taught_me_about_trading/,month,Due-diligence,0.94
1nm2lej,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 12:25:25,Here's a realistic breakdown of what it actually takes to become a consistent trader,"Ive noticed most people get into day trading because they see screenshots of $5k, $10k, $50k days and think it’s a quick path to freedom. I’ll be straight with you guys, that’s the marketing version of trading. Please don't buy into it. The reality is much less glamorous, and if you don’t know what it really takes, you’re going to burn out fast. After 5 years in this game, i wanted to do a little write up on my honest breakdown of what consistency actually looks like. This is Part 3 of my education series here, follow if you want more.

1. Time commitment is way more than you expect.

Trading isn’t just 9:30am to 4pm. Real consistency comes from hours outside market time: premarket prep, journaling, reviewing trades, building watchlists, studying setups, and putting in screen time. Early on, I easily spent 40 to 60 hours a week between live trading and studying. If you treat this like a hobby, you’ll get hobby-level results.

And it’s not just the hours, it’s the years. Consistency doesn’t come in 6 months, or even a year for most people. You’re rewiring how you think about money, risk, and decision-making under pressure. Expect it to take 2 or 3 years of real effort before you’re truly stable.

2. Risk management is non-negotiable.

I know everyone hears this, but most beginners still ignore it. Consistency doesn’t mean you never lose... it means your losses are small and controlled while your winners are slightly bigger. That balance, over hundreds of trades, is what keeps you profitable.

I don’t care if you’ve got the best setup in the world; if you’re risking half your account on one trade, you’re gambling. True consistency comes from risking small, living to fight another day, and never letting one trade or one day define you.

3. Discipline beats strategy.

Every new trader is obsessed with finding the “perfect” strategy. They’ll cycle through indicators, patterns, and systems, convinced the answer is out there somewhere. The truth? Most basic strategies work if you follow them with discipline. Most traders fail not because of their system, but because they don’t stick to it.

Consistency is boring. It’s showing up, following the same rules, and resisting the urge to deviate because of greed or fear. If you can’t execute a simple plan consistently, no “advanced” strategy will save you.

4. You need emotional resilience.

Day trading will mess with your head. You’re going to lose money. You’re going to question if you’re cut out for this. You’re going to watch your P/L swing in seconds and feel emotions you didn’t know you had. The people who survive aren’t the ones who avoid that... they’re the ones who learn to handle it.

Emotional resilience means not tying your identity to your results. It means accepting red days without revenge trading. It means staying calm when you’re up big and not blowing it all chasing more. Without that mental toughness, you’ll self-destruct.

5. You have to treat it like a business.

This isn’t a game. If you’re serious about consistency, you have to approach trading like running a business. That means budgeting your capital, keeping records, analyzing performance, and making adjustments based on data, not emotion. Your journal is your balance sheet. Your setups are your products. Your time and focus are your resources.

When you treat trading like a hobby, it costs you money. When you treat it like a business, it gives you structure and accountability. That shift in mindset is often the difference between gamblers and professionals.

**Bottom line**

Becoming a consistent trader isn’t flashy. It’s not about one big win, a secret indicator, or a magic system. It’s about boring, repetitive, disciplined work.. day after day, year after year. If you accept that reality, you’ll stop chasing shortcuts and actually give yourself a chance to make it.

1noh5ve,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 09:18:13,The harsh truths nobody tells you about trading,"Most people come into day trading with dreams of financial freedom, working from a laptop, and making thousands before lunch time. And i honestly don’t blame them.. that’s how it’s sold online. But the reality of day trading is a lot harsher than what you see here from /r/wallstreetbets screenshots. For those who are serious about this, i wanted to list some of the truths most people won’t tell you until you’ve already lost a ton of money. This is part of an ongoing education series on reddit, if you like write ups like these, follow my account for more.

1. Most people lose money (and keep losing).

It’s estimated that 80 to 90% of traders fail, and that stat is no joke. The market is a zero-sum game; your wins come from someone else’s losses, and when you’re new, you’re the one feeding the experienced players. No strategy, guru, or indicator will change the fact that you’re paying tuition to the market in the beginning.

The hard part isn’t just learning setups..  it’s surviving long enough to actually get good. And the majority never make it past that stage because they run out of money or burn out mentally before they develop any consistency.

2. It takes years, not months, to get consistent.

A lot of beginners think they’ll be profitable within 6 months if they just grind hard enough. The truth is it usually takes 2 to 3 years of daily effort before you can really call yourself consistent. That’s thousands of hours of screen time, journaling, reviewing trades, and slowly building emotional resilience.

If that sounds like too much, trading probably isn’t for you. This is more like learning a professional craft (surgery, law, engineering) than picking up a side hustle. If you treat it like a shortcut, you’ll blow up.

3. Trading is boring when done right.

The highlight reels on social media show explosive wins and big green days. What you don’t see is that consistent trading is painfully repetitive. You’re taking the same setups over and over, cutting losers quickly, and stacking small wins.

If you’re looking for excitement, you’ll force trades, gamble on hype stocks, and churn your account into dust. The truth is the boring traders are the ones still around after 5 years.

4. Your emotions are your biggest enemy.

Everyone thinks they’ll be calm and logical until they watch their P/L swing hundreds or thousands in seconds. Fear makes you sell winners too early, greed makes you hold losers too long, and ego makes you size up when you shouldn’t.

No book or strategy will fix this for you; you only learn by facing it. The sooner you realize trading is 80% psychology and 20% strategy, the sooner you’ll start working on the real skill set that matters.

5. You won’t get rich with a small account.

Turning $1k into $100k in a year makes for a great screenshot, but it’s not reality. A small account limits your options and magnifies your risk. Realistic growth is slow, and it compounds over time. If you’re starting with $1 to 2k, your first goal should be survival and skill-building, not quitting your job.

The harsh truth is trading for income requires a big enough account to absorb losses and still generate meaningful returns. You don’t have to start huge, but you do need realistic expectations about what’s possible.

**Bottom Line**

Day trading isn’t the glamorous, quick-money lifestyle most people think it is. It’s a grind, it’s boring when done right, and it takes years to develop the skills and mindset needed to survive. If you’re still reading this and it doesn’t scare you off, that’s a good sign... you might have the patience and discipline to actually stick it out. Follow me for my next post.

See, if I could restart, I’d focus on one style instead of bouncing between scalping, swing trading, and whatever strategy I saw online. Ive noticed that's what a lot of you guys do, and thays what I did when i was new to trading too. 

That constant switching wasted years. See, I’d build a simple, rule-based system around one setup, journal every trade, and treat it like a business from day one. Journaling felt pointless when I started, it really did... but in reality it was the only thing that forced me to see patterns in my wins and losses. On top of that, I’d make risk management non-negotiable. Back then I thought max loss rules and position sizing were things for “later,” but they’re what would have kept me from blowing up accounts and losing confidence early. Surviving year one should be the real goal, not doubling your account. Just surviving.

The other big shift would be mindset. I wasted too much time idolizing gurus and searching for a magic indicator, when in reality every trader I know who’s still around relies on discipline, execution, and patience. The edge isn’t a secret tool... it’s following your plan even when it’s boring. I also would’ve treated my capital like a startup investment, not gambling money. That means clear expectations, realistic goals, and understanding that profitability takes years, not weeks. If I had approached day one with that perspective, I’d be far ahead of where I am today.

1na0nug,2025-09-06,2025-09-06 10:16:18,Walking away from a hedge fund desk to trade my own algos was the hardest (and scariest) decision I ever made…,"I used to sit behind a multi-monitor setup at a family office, surrounded by PhDs and ex-bank quants. On paper, it was the dream job: stable pay, access to capital, and the illusion of prestige. But here’s the part no one tells you, most hedge funds don’t actually innovate. They recycle the same old factor models, fight for scraps of alpha, and drown in bureaucracy.

Meanwhile, the retail world has quietly evolved. With today’s tech, a small team (or even a single obsessed coder) can build strategies that rival or outperform what we ran in-house. The structural edge hedge funds used to have is gone, execution costs are near zero, APIs are wide open, and cloud compute is dirt cheap.

So I left. I poured everything into designing and stress-testing my own systems. Not flashy, not “get rich quick” nonsense — just robust, data-driven algos running across multiple markets.

What surprised me most wasn’t the returns (though those shocked me too)… it was the freedom. Not having to answer to an IC committee, not having to pitch every idea, not being capped by arbitrary risk budgets. Just pure research → code → live execution.

I’ll be honest: it’s terrifying sometimes. But when I look at my equity curves now (screenshots attached), I can’t help but think this was the right move.

Curious if anyone else here has taken the leap from “institutional” to “independent”? Do you feel like retail strategies are actually more agile now than what big funds are running?

Background : I lost my job in February. Early 60s so I figured, rather than go back to the labor market, I'd transition to trading full time. And when people asked what I was going to do, I said. 

I started during covid, like many, so had been through the learning curve. But this year was, obviously, more intense and I'm finally pulling ahead in the black. 

So this friend, who is normally a wonderful person, a few weeks ago dropped a text bomb that they want me to come over to their house and help them pick a few stocks. Later I them I told them I couldn't, for the same reason I wouldn't tell them how to spend their money in any other situation, and they dropped it. 

Now, they're asking again. I just said to look at data.

1ngw28u,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 12:40:40,Why does it take many years to become profitable with trading?,"Hi traders. Im still quite new to trading (trading for only 6 months now). And before i get into this question, I am not claiming to be profitable or nearly there yet, I just wanna know what it takes.

Why does it take most people 3+ years to be profitable when trading is said to be better when it is simplified? In my eyes, the main things you need to be successful are: 

\- A strategy that has been extensively backtested that is proven to work

\- Good risk management

\- The psychological aspect of trading where you objectively follows the rules of your trading plan and not let your emotions impact how you execute and manage trades.

The way i see it: finding a working strategy with good risk management shouldnt take too long if you have enough time. A strategy can be backtested over 12 months within 2 days of being on fxreplay. so theoretically if you have time to you could backtest around 10 strategy variations a month. Forward testing can happen as time goes by.

I understand for some the psychology aspect may take a while to master, but lets say that someone has little emotional decision making from the start and has a vast understanding that trading involves losing as well, you just need a good RR, even though your win rate is less than 50%.

  
Taking into account all the above, I dont see why it cant take someone about a year to become profitable?

• $2,760 for rent ($230 x 12 months)
• $4,560 for my salary ($380 x 12 months)

I’m already accustomed to living lean and making ~$238/month at my current job, so survival isn’t the issue. The first three months after leaving won’t even be focused on trading. They’ll be about decompressing, appreciating life, and recharging before going all-in.

That’s it. No overcomplication, no delusion, just a base, a buffer, and time.

I’d love to hear about your experiences with this.

I’ve been trading for a while now, but I keep noticing the same pattern: as long as I’m working my regular job, I can’t stay consistently profitable. Work and daily life take my focus, I lose discipline, and eventually my gains get eaten up again.

But when I’m on vacation, it’s the complete opposite – I’m focused, structured, and suddenly profitable. It makes me wonder if this is really sustainable as a side hustle.

So I’m curious:
	•	How was it for you when you first started trading?
	•	Have you managed to stay consistently profitable while keeping a job?
	•	Or did you eventually reach the point where you decided: “all in or nothing,” quit your job, and go full-time?
	•	Did you go through failures and restarts along the way?

Really interested to hear your stories and learnings. 🙌",82,119,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1n9x6qm/trading_while_working_a_fulltime_job_is_it_really/,month,Discussion,0.9
1ndz3iy,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 00:03:29,8 years in the stuff that finally made me consistent,"


I’m not a guru and I’m not rich. I’m a trader who started with options, moved to futures, blew more accounts than I want to admit, and only got truly consistent in the last couple of years. If you’re early in the journey, learn from my mistakes so you can skip some of the pain.

the mnemonic that kept me honest: stay calm

Eight principles that actually changed my results.

S - size small until you’re consistent My best decision wasn’t a new indicator. It was cutting size to the point where losses were annoying, not identity-shaking. Small risk made it possible to execute the plan after a loss instead of spiraling.

T - track everything Your memory lies. The journal doesn’t. Once I logged entries, exits, reason for entry, screenshots, emotional state, and R multiple, patterns jumped out. Premature exits. Revenge trades. Friday slippage. All invisible until it was on paper, I cold see everything crystal clear, even the dumbest things that were right infront of me all along, for exaple: I had a 10% winrate trading London session :/. Journaling in tradezella made this process easier because I could actually see the data that my emotions wanted to ignore.

A - accept losses fast A setup can be A+ and still fail. What matters is whether you respect the invalidation. If price tags your line and says you’re wrong, you’re done. Taking the cut early is cheaper than negotiating with the market.

Y - yield to context The same setup behaves differently in trend vs chop, open vs lunch, high-vol vs dead tape. I keep two playbooks now: trend and range. If context doesn’t match the playbook, I don’t force it.

C - commit to one model My breakthrough came from mastering one entry model and one management style. Backtested it hundreds of times. Forward tested it. Now I know exactly what I’m waiting for and what disqualifies it.

A - audit your ego Ego shows up as adding recklessly, holding losers because “it has to bounce,” or scaling too fast after a streak. When I made rules that specifically target ego, my equity curve smoothed out.

L - level to level execution Plan the levels, define risk, set targets, and let the trade work. If I move a stop or take profit outside the plan, I write down why. Most times the why is fear or greed. That awareness fixed more P&L than any new tool.

M - make routines your edge Pre-market checklist. Session guardrails. Post-market review. Rinse and repeat. When routines got boring, results got better. The structure I built in my journal turned trading into a repeatable process instead of a coin flip.

1nklchw,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 17:44:20,From Nothing to Profitable: My Grounded Approach to Trading Strategy Design,"Look, most active traders don’t fail because they’re lazy - they fail because they overfit, build strategies backwards &/or never collect enough data.

I’ve been there - chasing systems and setups that didn’t make logical sense or didn’t fit my schedule.

Eventually I stopped following bs noise and started building from nothing the way systems should be built.

I'm going to try to break this down step by step - not just the rules, but how I’d think if I were starting from next to zero trading experience. Regardless if you are Mechanical or Discretionary this guide is designed to help you find your edge.

Let’s say I’ve just decided to become a trader. I know nothing. I just have the will. Here’s what I’d do. For those who’ve seen **Version 1 (Now deleted) search \[4\] to see key changes. Thank you!**

**Citations are visible at the bottom for context if desired**

# #1 I'd feel and adjust to my constraints first

**You start with what is possible for you, personally. That immediately rules out half the noise.**

* Time of day you can realistically trade (not **idealized** \- **realistically**)
* Knowing in advance if you need to sleep or work through certain sessions & what that means for your trading execution
* Do you want to hold trades overnight or not & is it compatible with your system (yes or no, on a strategy-by-strategy basis)
* How much capital will you trade with (eventually)?

**Why? Because all rule-building happens within constraints.**  
If you work a day job and trade 5m charts, you’re probably not able to trade the New York session. If you only trade during London session, you don’t build rules around Asian session. It really depends on time zones and other factors. Higher timeframes like hourly allow for higher versatility.

Ignoring constraints is why a lot of retail traders go nowhere – they copy others without aligning their system with their actual life. If you're ""trading here and there""/""when I can trade, I do X,"" it's adding noise to your results. The more variance in consistency, the worse it is for your bottom line.

# Pick One Market & Timeframe

**You don’t experiment with everything. Pick one instrument and one timeframe.**

For example: Dow Jones, hourly chart

**Why? Because markets behave differently.** Trying to make a system that works on Nasdaq, Gold, EURUSD, and Dow Jones at once is usually unwise. You will overfit or your strategy will break.

**One market. One behaviour set/trade setup.** If you want to run multiple instruments or setups/systems, split the risk amongst them. Each one should be good enough to isolate the risk and perform on its own.

**You must understand how your chosen market behaves. \[3\] & \[5\]**  
**Mean reverting, Alternating/Near Random Walk or Trending**

**Examples**  
Mean reverting: Dow Jones/YM, EURUSD  
Alternating/Near Random Walk: S&P 500/ES  
Trending: Nasdaq/NQ

You can do research to know which is which but if you want in-depth you can ask AI to use Hurst Exponent & Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test over market data.

Or if you're into programming you can get python script to do it. ADF Visuals + Hurst Exponential Chart Example

# Start Building with Logic, Not Results

To clarify, when you're learning, it's okay to look at charts for a while to familiarise yourself with how they look and what the candlesticks show.

The key is to avoid falling into the trap of confirmation bias. **You should write down an idea first, then test it.** **Do not change your rules as you go along.** And most importantly!

**Never go searching through charts to find ideas to test.**

**Start at the drawing board not the candlesticks.**  
Forget indicators. Forget entries. First you need structure. Here's what to make rules about:

**1. Trade Time Window**  
Define which hours are “valid” for entering trades, based on when your chosen market has high volume.  
**Example:** 8am to 4pm NY time for US indices.

**Why?** Because you need volatility to reach targets & volume at your entries for price to trend in your favour regardless of your system style (reversals, mean reversion or trend trading).

**Ex. Rule:**  
“I only take trades between 3pm and 9pm UK time.”

You can mark this with a sessions indicator (e.g. ""Sessions on Chart"" on TradingView, 10:00 to 16:00 setting).

# Risk Management

**Decide what you’re risking per trade.** Fixed % (e.g., 3% of account).  
In a live environment this value can be based on risk tolerance. It must be a logical value that fits within your goals, limits and needs. Your risk needs to be planned ahead, and stuck to. Your risk can be static or dynamic.

**For prop firms, you must calculate your risk to fall in line with the maximum drawdown rules.**

The Amount risked has to be calculated with maximum drawdown & maximum daily drawdown in heavy consideration.

For example, someone may have a system with a loss equivalent to 10 losses in a row -10R maximum in testing his prop firm allows up to 10% maximum drawdown so he decides to trade 0.6% per trade allowing him to have space for that maximum peak to trough drawdown + 50% extra.

**Dynamic example:**  
More Aggressive traders may opt in for back tested rules to increase risk when holding on profitable running positions ex. Entering another position on another rejection (scaling in) or having pre-defined plans to increase risk during winning or losing periods in live environments depending on their risk tolerance & goals.

**Decide what your target-to-stop-loss ratio is before testing the system and stick with it (e.g., RRR: 2:1, 5:1, etc.).**

Don't adjust this to get better trading performance - **pick it based on logic, not data.**

Ex. Rule: “I aim for 4-5R on all reversal trades"" &/or ""3-4R on continuation trades.”

**If the system doesn't work, I throw it out.**

**Added Annotation for clarity: Find \[1\] At end of doc**

# Entry Style (Define Setup Type)

**Bar Replay backtest only.** Never scroll backward to ‘check’ the setup again.

**Pick something linear and logical.**  
Mean reversion? Reversals? Continuations? Breakouts?

Then ask: **What does that look like?**  
Do I want price to hit a level and reject (reversal)?  
Do I want price to push through and pull back (breakout/continuation)?  
**And why would it work?** What does my setup signify via **order flow mechanics**? **\[5\]**

**Order flow isn’t a system or strategy like educators teach.**  
**It’s the basics of how markets move on a tick-by-tick basis.**

**Basic Example explanation:** 

If there's a buyer at $10,000.25 who wants 100 units, but only 80 are available, price moves up one tick to $10,000.5 to fill the rest.

**Ex. 10000.5 50 available 10000.25 80 available**

He gets **80 filled at 10000.25 and 20 (the rest) at 10000.5**

(10000.25\*(80/100))+(10000.5\*(20/100)) = **10000.3 average**

price fill -> price increased to **10000.5**

# This is liquidity.

The only reason price moves is that there’s an imbalance between buy and sell volume. Nothing else

**That's why markets have a highly random nature. Example at Bonus 2**

Tick = minimum price movement on an instrument.

**Example purposes only: 3-wick reversal**

https://preview.redd.it/vbdtsa8hvzpf1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=810d0b202468627ca8a9a7640688943a260c6d5c

**3 Wick Entry Rule example purposes only:**  
“I place limit orders at the beginning wick of a 2-wick consecutive rejection if it forms and closes during my valid trading hours.”  
3 – Sell Limit Filled, Limit order pulled/expired if no fill on **bar 3**

https://reddit.com/link/1nklchw/video/4tg691xnvzpf1/player

**Short example using Order Flow Mechanics Knowledge \[5\]:**  
A wick high in a candle is rejected by the next candle and it closes. Sellers were present at that wick. Regardless of how the ""Order flow"" had taken place it is **irrefutable**.

If price revisits that price or higher and fails again, closing, I want to sell at that price - expecting a third rejection.

**Sell limit order fill, Bracketed with SL & TP (values known before the close)**

Vice versa for long setups.

**Most people who overcomplicate with “smart money” or “institutional”. Talk are waffling.**

# “If you are using charts to execute, you aren't smart money but you don't have to be dumb money either.”

**Dismiss educator narratives on why their methods supposedly work and use critical thinking applying Order flow mechanic basics to accept or dismiss trading entry ideas.**

Don't sleep walk into the ""institutional"" narrative fallacy’s educators sell you. Think about why price moves on a tick by tick basis and what the candlesticks you're basing your entry off actually indicate.

**Markets aren't ruled by patterns they're ruled by imbalances that's what fuels trends. Without an imbalance price won't move.**

If a setup doesn’t have logic like this backing up why it would succeed enough for it to be profitable besides randomness, you’re wasting your time.

# If your only answer to “why does it work?” is “my backtest says so,” you’re doomed

**I’ve asked a trader why he believes his system works besides his data and silence followed for minutes whilst he tried thinking of what to say. I shown him random OHLC candlesticks with his strategy applied and he thrown in the towel. Don’t be like this.**

https://reddit.com/link/1nklchw/video/t1tvferkvzpf1/player

**Examples of what not to base your system on:**

* Pivot points
* Fibonacci (**Based on faith and crowding**)
* MA bounces (**Random and seen on many data sets** ) Shown on Bonus 2 Fig.
* Complex multi-timeframe analysis (**Hard to quantify and bar replay backtest honestly without hindsight fogging vision**)
* Most **well known** indicators for entries

These methods are 1000% random with weak foundations or are purposefully hard to test accurately and honestly without overfitting. **Educators push it for plausible deniability when systems don’t perform. A model is hard to hold to account if there’s 1000 ways to trade it. The use of Multi time frame analysis in trading is fine as long as it’s not convoluted, has clear rules and is tested properly.**

# Target & Stop Loss Placement

**Targets must be placed consistently.**  
Targets are typically less important than entries and stops – but still important.

If using price structures (e.g. support/resistance), **define the logic first**, then the rules.

Ex. Someone could use swing highs/lows, support/resistance,

clustered wicks or rejection zones. **With fixed rules to define and mark them in advance.**

Price will naturally attract volume at these levels, **even if the instrument's order book volume doesn't reflect it in real time**. Ghost limit orders exist, pending stop orders & order fill algorithm triggers from **countless market participants for different reasons** it doesn't matter what happens when price interacts with these places it's just more often than not that they are **liquid areas**.

**Avoid fixed-distance targets - market volatility is dynamic.**

For example, a ""100 point fixed target"" or a ""20 point fixed stop"" is arbitrary and is not going to work if volatility shifts.

It is better to use dynamic yet consistent targeting methods. A trader must define fixed rules for regarding what is S/R and what is not.

So a dynamic targeting method ex. at defined highs or lows would be that for one trade it is 110 points, the second being 160 points, and the next is 140 points (all placed at predefined levels).

**Fixed targets overfit strategies easily.**

Your **execution costs** must be factored into your system.

Ex. 

If you use a 1:5 RR and a 100-pt target minimum, your minimum stop is 20 pts. 

If your max spread on your CFD is \~2pts, that’s 10% cost per trade - before everything else which matters.

Ex Rule: 

“Target is always ≥100 points for Dow. Stop is one-fifth of target.” - Why? Because it keeps costs at a modest level.

# Instrument-Specific Rules

**Some markets behave uniquely. You don’t need deep stats – just basic experience.**

* Nasdaq trends
* Dow mean reverts
* S&P 500 alternates. (Trending but Near random walk)
* Gold is erratic

Example: If you want mean reversion or early trend entries, Dow is a better choice than Nasdaq.

**Entry Model Influence Example:**  
**Example 1:** If you want mean reversion or early trend entries, Dow is a better choice than Nasdaq. (It’s more probable for Dow reverse intraday)  
**Example 2:** If you want to press trades or let positions run, Nasdaq is a better choice than Dow. (Trends are more pronounced on Nasdaq compared to Dow intraday)  
Either can have a trend or mean reversion model, but different strategies will tend to work better if aligned with the instrument’s nature.

**Strategy Risk Management Setup Influence Examples:**  
**Example 1:** If you have a strategy idea that includes rules to manually trail your stop loss in profit or uses large targets relative to stop size, Nasdaq would likely be a better choice compared to Dow. (Nasdaq trends more intraday which compliments this idea; Dow tends to mean revert/snap back, reducing the potential for home run trades.)  
**Example 2:** If you have a mean reversion strategy idea with a hard take profit and stop loss as risk management (most common), the Dow would likely be a better choice, as its intraday trends are less pronounced compared to the Nasdaq.

 

**Either market can have a trend and/or mean reversion model**, but different entry and risk management strategies will tend to work better if aligned with the instrument’s nature;

# These guidelines are of course not absolutes.

**Trending = Larger price extensions**, **Mean reversion = Higher likelihood of returning to the average price.**

**ADF & Hurst isn’t supposed to be used in real time it’s supposed to be used once to define an instrument and save time testing. Don’t forget that.**

# Start from Blank Charts

Instead of top-down start bottom up.

People look at charts for ideas when you need to **consult logic for inspiration**; **not recency biases from recent price action**. **Added Annotation for clarity: Find \[2\] At end of doc**

Back testing is there to put an idea to the test.

**Before building rules based on the chart, define a hypothesis.**

**Example:** 

**“What if I traded Dow Jones reversals using 3-wick setups with a 5R limit entry?”**

Then test this visually. On charts

**You’re not trying to make it “fit,” but to ask:**

*- Does this work during valid hours?* 

*- Does the visual match my logic?* 

*- Does the reaction make sense knowing Order flow’s nature?* 

*- Would my setup realistically hit target often enough to net a profit over time?*

**Only then write rules to test.**

# Write Rules as If You’re Giving Them to a Machine

**Your rules must be:**

* **Objective**
* **Actionable**
* **Not open to interpretation**
* **Modest costs ideally <20% Don’t let it exceed 30% of your expected R or your edge collapses (Exponential costs)** ex. If you risk $100 and your RR is 5:1 but after adding spread, comms and other costs like slippage it’s >3.5R / >70% of R realised minimum>$350 minimum on each 5R setup

**Bad Rule:**  
“If the market is ranging, I don’t trade.” **(No definition for range or how to identify it)**

**Good Rule:**  
“If a 3-wick setup forms between 3–9pm UK time, and the high/low of setup is beyond/below \[X filter\], place sell limit at top wick or buy limit at low wick.” **(Rule based intuition/discretion free)**

**Define everything clearly** \- the filter, logic, conditions, etc.

# Stress Test the System by Breaking It

**Once rules are written, test them brutally.** 

Ask:

\- Is this rule based on **logic** or **emotional comfort?** **Be emotionally detached**

  (ex. Breakeven or partial profits reduce strategy net profit - so why use them?)\*

Partials or Breakeven reduce strategy expectancy more often than not\*

\- Does it work over 3+ months of data? (Depending on timeframe)

1R = 1 unit of risk ex. 3%

Log the data, process it -1R+4R-1R-1R+4R

Date Example August 8**^(th)** to September 13**^(th)** **2024 on mean reversion systems for YM/Dow Jones is a good place to stress test due to the relentless intraday trends exhibited.**

**- What if trading costs rise 20%? (Reduce size of profits by \~20%)**

\- after the initial rejection candle close if there is an additional rejection should I scale in/increase the risk on the trade (Entry 2 typically has higher win rate vs Entry 1 when scaling in for my systems\*\*) testing will confirm whether it's worth doing\*\*. **To scale in or not to scale in**

Scaling in is only worth doing is the win rate if Entry 2 is superior to that of Entry 1 ex. 45% winrate Entry 2 vs 40% winrate (main entries) most systems don't benefit largely from it so **be careful.**

**Entry = Individual Trade Execution (filled with 1R risk per trade ex, 3%) 2 Entries = 3% \* 2 = 6% for example.**

**- Should I hedge or wait until my position is closed to enter setups on the opposite direction?**

**-Is it worth holding overnight?**

**-Do I have enough leverage/margin to trade this strategy on my broker or prop firm of choice (find out the leverage needed maximum per trade with stop distance % relative to % risk per trade desired)**

# You're not seeking perfection, but robustness. 

**If a small change breaks your system - it’s overfit noise.**

# Bonus: When in Doubt, Zoom Out

**Ask: Does this decision happen every trade?**  
If yes, write a rule. If not, STOP, think, and evaluate the logic.

**You should:**

* **Know your risk % – make a rule**
* **Know your stop – make a rule**
* **Aim to know target, stop, and entry price(s) before the candle closes  (Bracketed limit orders help a lot.)**

# Added Annotations [4]:

**\[1\] The specific ratios don't matter. You shouldn't be curve fitting/overfitting your system (trying to find the best ratio)**

Elaboration:

The logic in the example behind using 3-4R in continuation trades is that you should allow for larger movements against your entry because you're entering in the middle of a trend. For example, when trend following, if you're buying, you are executing at premium prices, not at discount prices. more space for error is required.

And 4-5 Ratio for example is encouraging tighter stop losses relative to target for Reversals because you're actively going against the trend.

The ratios given were example ratios you can change them based on your ideas.

**\[2\] When I mean consult logic, I meant order flow mechanics \[3\] which I mention in the document primarily but it's also about rejecting ideas like MA Bounces and Fibonacci which aren't logical reasons to engage with the markets.**

Hurst tells you if a data series/chart trends, reverts or leans towards a random walk. Helps decide trending market vs mean reverting market.

**1. ADF Test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller)**

What it ADF tells you in practice:

ADF checks whether a time series is mean-reverting i.e., do things tend to wander off indefinitely, or does it tend to return to some average value over time elapsed.

If the ADF test is “significant” (p-value < 0.05):

The series does revert to a mean.

When a time series ex a candlestick chart is mean reverting imagine price is like a stretched rubber band when it moves away from the average, it tends to snap back/reverse.

If it's not significant (p-value > 0.05):

The series is likely a random walk, drifting unpredictably without any sort of central anchor.

2. Hurst Exponent

What Hurst tells you in practice:

It quantifies how “trendy” or “mean-reverting” a time series is.

H ≈ 0.5 The chart/time series is random noise; random walk/Brownian motion.

H < 0.5 → The chart is mean-reverting tends to snap back.

H > 0.5 → The chart has momentum tends to have extensions/continuation in the same direction i.e trend.

**Key Changes in Version 2 \[4\]:**

Many small tweaks for clarity, added important clarifications especially on Step 7, included annotations for context, and I’ve provided definitions to support beginners.

The model hasn’t changed it’s just explained better. Changes were based on trader insights and needs. Thanks for the feedback. I Appreciate it – Ron.

# TL;DR & Summary:

**Structure before everything.**  
**Logic before data.**  
**Consistency before optimization.**  
Logic → Rules → Data → Optimisation **(Based on ideas, not data or it’s curve fitting)“Why” before “What.”**

**Every rule is based on:**

1. **What you can realistically do**
2. **What the market allows** (ex scalping CFDs is usually not a viable strategy due to higher or exaggerated costs on higher lot sizes) 
3. **What gives clear, repeatable decisions**

**You don’t optimize to improve win rate or net gain.**  
You optimize to enhance the logic behind the system – which often translates to improved performance (net gain)

Yes – the first 0–20 hours (first few testing sessions) will feel foggy. Then it clicks.  
You’ll never know if it works until you test it exactly as written.  
That’s when the market becomes your teacher.

If a system implodes/stops working it doesn't mean a different variation of it can't work again in the future.

1nbczo8,2025-09-07,2025-09-07 23:18:11,How do I even start trading from scratch?,"
I recently finished my Master’s in Data Science, but I’ve been feeling drawn toward trading. The problem is, I have absolutely no clue how to even begin.

Do I start with an online course, or should I just dive into paper trading and figure it out? I’m comfortable with data, stats, and analysis thanks to my background, but I’ve never actually traded before.

I could get a little financial support from my dad to start, but nothing major — so I don’t want to burn through money blindly. My main goal is to learn and get a feel for the markets first, and maybe build it into something serious over time.

For those of you who’ve gone down this path:
	•	How did you start?
	•	What resources would you recommend for someone new but analytical?
	•	Should I focus on one area first (stocks, options, forex, crypto), or just experiment?
	•	Anything you wish you knew when you were at the very beginning?

Any advice, book/course recommendations, or even “don’t do it” stories are welcome.

Thanks!

Many people lose money trying to pick tops or bottoms and fighting against strong momentum, but the market rarely rewards that approach.

When you align with the prevailing direction, you move with the flow of money and increase your probability of success.

Following the trend helps you minimize unnecessary risks, avoid emotional mistakes, and capture bigger moves with less stress. The trend is your friend, so stay patient, disciplined, and let the market work in your favor.

1njy68v,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 23:51:46,Risk management isn’t about protecting your account.,"Everyone says “use good risk management,” but most traders don’t understand what that really means. It’s not just about avoiding a blown account. It’s about making sure your head stays in the game.



When I sized too big, every tick against me felt like my stomach was dropping. I’d close trades early just to “feel safe,” or I’d add more size to “fix” a bad entry. It wasn’t the market beating me, it was my own emotions.



Once I started tracking everything, I noticed something insane: my win rate barely changed when I cut my size in half. But my stress level dropped by 80%. Suddenly, I was following my rules. Suddenly my setups actually had a chance to play out.



That’s when I learned: risk management isn’t about surviving one trade. It’s about giving yourself the mental space to survive the next 1,000 trades.



Profitable trading isn’t about swinging for home runs. It’s about staying alive long enough to let your edge work.

  
A lot of traders get too focused on the most perfect entry, but they should actually build a risk management system after they've found their edge and model.

1nk9w4g,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 10:31:23,Ready to be embarrassed.. here are my biggest mistakes I made in my first year of trading...,"Lol when I first started messing around with stocks and option trading, I thought I was smarter than the market. I genuinely wanted to ""turn $1000 into $10000"" and just keep going. So, I watched all the videos, read all the stupid books, and figured I’d pick it up fast. Instead, my first year was a series of expensive lessons. It was bad. I blew up accounts, overtraded, and ignored the basics that I now know are non-negotiable. If you’re just starting out, i reaply wanted to write out my biggest mistakes I made that you can hopefully avoid. This is part 2 of an ongoing education series for those who are interested in following. Hopefully this can help some of you guys.

1. Trading too big, too soon.

Sizing up too fast was my downfall more than once. I thought the quickest way to grow an account was to swing big. The problem is, your emotions swing just as big. When you’re over-leveraged, you stop following your plan and start praying. That’s when panic selling, bag-holding, and account blow-ups happen.

Looking back, I should’ve kept my position size embarrassingly small until I was profitable for months at a time. Trading tiny builds discipline without wrecking your confidence or your account. The truth is, year one isn’t about making money, it’s about surviving long enough to actually get good.

2. Chasing alerts and hype.

Bruh, I spent months glued to X or reddit “gurus.” Every time they called out a ticker, I’d jump in without thinking. I almost always bought too late, and when the move reversed, I’d eat the loss. It felt like I was trading, but really I was just gambling on other people’s ideas.

The problem is you don’t have conviction in trades you didn’t find yourself. You’ll panic out the second it goes red, or hold too long hoping the guru is right. Once I ditched alerts and focused on building my own watchlists, my trading improved overnight. If you can’t explain why you’re in a trade, you shouldn’t be in it.

3. Ignoring stop losses.

This was my most expensive mistake. I’d set a stop, but when price got close I’d convince myself to “give it room.” Before I knew it, the loss was 3x what I planned. It only takes a couple of these to wreck your account and your headspace.

The truth is, honoring stops isn’t about being right or wrong; it’s about protecting your capital so you can trade another day. Blowing past stops is a rookie move that costs you money and keeps you stuck in a cycle of regret. If you only fix one mistake from this list, make it this one.

4. Overtrading out of boredom.

The urge to click buttons just to feel like you’re “doing something” is real. I’d sit there staring at charts, waiting for action, and eventually take subpar trades just to scratch the itch. Most of those turned into small, frustrating losses that added up.

Learning to do nothing when nothing’s there was one of the hardest skills I had to learn. Some days the best trade really is no trade. The market rewards patience, not action. Treat your trading capital like bullets; you don’t fire unless the target is clear.

5. Thinking strategy was everything.

In my first year, I hopped from one strategy to the next like a kid in a candy store. I thought I just hadn’t found the “holy grail” yet. The problem wasn’t the strategies... it was me. I wasn’t giving anything enough time to actually master it, and I wasn’t disciplined enough to stick to the rules.

What I eventually realized is that most strategies work if you execute them consistently and manage risk. Two traders can run the same setup (one profits, the other blows up) because psychology, discipline, and risk management matter more than the setup itself.

6. Not tracking my trades.

I went months without journaling or reviewing my trades. At the time, I thought I’d just “remember” what worked. Lol I didn’t... I repeated the same mistakes over and over because I had no system for holding myself accountable.

Once I started journaling (writing down why I entered, why I exited, and how I felt) I saw my patterns clear as day. I realized I revenge traded after losses, chased green candles, and cut winners too early. Tracking isn’t sexy, but it’s the only way to spot flaws in your behavior and actually fix them.

7. Not protecting my mental health.

Trading wrecked me emotionally that first year. I tied my self-worth to my P/L, so every red day felt like a personal failure. I’d overtrade trying to “make it back” or sit there depressed after one bad trade. That cycle burned me out.

The fix was learning to detach from the outcome of a single trade or even a single day. The only thing that matters is consistency over time. If you let your emotions run the show, you’ll destroy yourself. Protecting your mindset is just as important as protecting your account balance.


Take away

Your first year probably won’t make you rich. Mine didn’t. What it will do is teach you the lessons that separate gamblers from traders. Blowups, losses, and frustration are part of the process, but you don’t need to make all the same mistakes I did. Start small, track everything, respect risk, and don’t forget this is a long game. I plan on posting more here so feel free to follow my acc if you're interested.

1nwu19z,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 05:04:43,Any full time profitable traders here? Is it worth it to keep going? I am thinking of quitting,"Hey,

I’ve been trading for about six years now. I started with a lot of learning and basic strategies, and then I got introduced to Guerrilla Trading (a former trading community from London). I learned their strategies, practiced on demo, and did a lot of backtesting.

I managed to pass the FTMO challenge, but ended up blowing the account. After that, I traded live with $1,000 and didn’t blow any live accounts—so I’d say I’ve developed discipline when it comes to managing emotions and sticking to a strategy.

Later, I developed a more aggressive short-term strategy based on the 15-minute chart. But after backtesting and live testing, I’m starting to doubt whether it’s actually profitable.

The Guerrilla Trading community turned out to be a scam and eventually shut down. That said, the strategy itself wasn’t terrible—I just haven’t been able to make it work profitably in the market conditions of the past 2–3 years. After losing a few thousand dollars on learning (losing is not the accurate word her, I learned a lot), testing, and FTMO attempts, I’m feeling pretty lost.

Right now, I’m nearing the end of university and starting to wonder: is this it for trading? Should I let go of the dream?

So I just want to ask—are there any full-time profitable traders here? Is it still worth pushing forward? I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts.If you’re a consistently profitable trader, please share your honest opinion.

The truth is if your system doesn’t have an edge, then all the discipline in the world won’t save you. Discipline only amplifies what’s already there. If you’ve got a negative expectancy, discipline just makes you bleed out slower and more reliably.

I see a lot of traders saying they just need to “lock in” or “be more consistent” and that’s why they’re losing. No. Most of the time the reason they’re losing is because the way they trade has no edge in the first place. You can be a consistent loser. In fact, most traders are.

1ns0d47,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 13:01:54,You lose because you don’t understand averaging down,"Somewhere some guru heard a hedge fund guy talk about averaging down. And then the guru took that gambling mentality and sold it as a strategy. Most of the time it works.

Listen carefully.

Most of the time it works.

That’s the trap. 

When it doesn’t. Game over.

You’ve been doing it wrong. Again. Stop it. Pay attention. And learn how to stop losing. 

If I average down, I’m usually spot trading. I don’t do this for options as that’s already set for optimal convexity. 

Your SL should be away from the violence. I mean way away. Like whatever you think is away, more away. 

Your SL is in the back with the binoculars watching the fight carefully. That’s where your max loss is. 

Again. Max loss. So if that’s 1% that would be there. A huge ass swing in the wrong direction and then it takes you out at one percent.

Now, when you enter, don’t enter in your full position. Wait. If it goes on, fine let it. You can scale in later. 

But now, if it pulls back. Get in again. Now what you’re doing is sort of averaging your midpoint of the trade. You’re getting a better entry and if price keeps going the wrong way, you’re risking less than your full 1%. 

Then when you get the confirmation going back in your direction, enter again, and when it breaks the high or low, enter one more. 

Congratulations, you now know how average down and to scale into any one of your stupid strategies to give you a better chance at obtaining an edge. 

Your guru is lying to you. Stop listening to them. They don’t know what they are talking about. You just don’t know enough to know how stupid they all sound.

When you first started trading, how long did it take before you stopped bleeding your account? How long until you were at least breaking even? And then, how much longer until you were consistently profitable?

I get that everyone’s timeline is different, some blow up multiple accounts before it clicks, others seem to stabilize faster. But I think hearing real experiences (the good and the bad) could be super useful for people like me who are trying to set realistic expectations.

Did something specific shift for you (like journaling, risk management, focusing on fewer setups), or was it just screen time and experience stacking up?

1nkkj55,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 17:12:05,20 years of trading: my biggest mistakes & lessons,"I’ve been trading for about 20 years now, and looking back, most of my setbacks weren’t about having the “wrong” strategy, honestly, they were just about my own behavior (as hard as that is to admit).

The two biggest mistakes I made early on:

1. **Selling winners too early.** I can’t count the times I sold stocks like Meta or Nvidia after a quick 2x, only to watch them 10x or 100x later. The short-term mindset killed me. If you really believe in a company and have done the work, sometimes the best move is to sit on your hands and let time do the heavy lifting.
2. **Not focusing on my edge.** Most of my losses came from chasing trends outside of my lane. Where I’ve consistently done well is riding blue chips and staying in areas where I actually understand the fundamentals. It’s boring sometimes, but boring makes money as much as people on social media preach the opposite.

If I could give my younger self advice:

* Journal every trade so you can see your *own* patterns (good and bad).
* Don’t force setups just to feel active — patience > action.
* Protect your mental capital. Trading scared is worse than not trading at all.

I had dabbled in trading part-time starting in 2015, but in 2021, something changed. I found the right path, and it became a total obsession. The next two years were about complete focus with thousands of hours glued to charts, internalizing my setups.  My trading is hugely influenced by Mark Minervini and his VCP pattern. That is still pretty much what I trade. 

I had been fortunate in my career (the Bay Area pays well) and had saved over a million dollars. When I decided to go full-time, I did it cautiously, allocating only 25% of my savings to trading capital.

My first full-time year, 2023, was a struggle for months. With my swing trading style, there are long periods where the market isn't giving me anything. Then, August came. I caught a monster trend and it felt like everything clicked into place. I ended the year up 100%.

The second year started strong, but then I did something profoundly stupid. I took on a tremendous amount of risk on a new instrument and it went sideways. It was my worst drawdown. That one mistake weighed heavy on me. For the most of the year, I was wrestling with self-doubt, failing to execute top setups. I ended the year up 8%, but I know that I'd thrown away at least a 30% year.

This year, I've done almost everything right. I've been disciplined and followed my process, and I'm up over 30%. But the mental struggle is constant. 

After just a few losses, I still wonder if I'll ever have a winning trade again.

This is a very hard profession. The way I trade, where I make the vast majority of my money in just a few weeks in an entire year, takes a huge mental toll. 

After a few string of losses, I still find it incredibly difficult to risk - 1-2% of my account - even on top setup. I hope I can get better at this.

Like, how much of success is actually your ability to analyze, manage risk, and execute - and how much is just plain timing and randomness?

On paper, trading is all about skill: reading charts, understanding fundamentals, controlling emotions, applying good risk management. But at the same time… let’s be honest, there’s always randomness involved. You can do everything “right” and still get wrecked by a random news headline, an algo sweep, or just bad timing.

Some people say skill is what makes you *survive long-term*. Luck might get you a big win here and there, but skill (discipline, consistency, proper sizing) is what prevents you from blowing up when luck inevitably turns. Others argue that even the best traders in the world still rely on luck to some degree - they just put themselves in spots where they can get lucky more often than not.

Even legends talk about it:

* **Warren Buffett** has admitted he was “lucky to be born in the right place and the right time” for his style of investing to thrive.  
* **George Soros** has said that being wrong and cutting losses quickly is more important than being right - which sounds a lot like acknowledging randomness.  
* **Ray Dalio** often emphasizes that markets are too complex for anyone to predict perfectly, so diversification is about managing what you *can’t* control (aka luck).  

And honestly, it reminds me a lot of **poker**. In the short run, luck dominates - a weaker hand can win on a river card. But in the long run, skill separates pros from amateurs, because the skilled players consistently make better decisions with the odds they’re given. Trading feels the same way: you can’t control the “cards” (market moves), but you can control how you play them.

From my side, I feel like skill shows up over the long run - but in the short run, it can absolutely feel like luck is in the driver’s seat.

1nd5m8c,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 01:16:29,The Truth about ICT,"
At its core, ICT and similar “price action” strategies can never be proven to work long term because they all boil down to essentially breakeven systems that rely on randomness and hot streaks to give the illusion of an edge. In every market and every time period, you’ll always find candle patterns or setups that occasionally line up and produce wins, but that’s just variance — a statistical inevitability when enough people trade enough patterns. This is why ICT traders can always point to a “perfect setup” that worked last week while ignoring the dozens that failed, and it’s why so many end up blaming “PA” or market conditions when their edge falls apart. 

The uncomfortable truth is that you can build a career in prop firms by exploiting asymmetric payouts — for example, if a challenge costs $100 and you have a 50/50 shot of hitting +$2,000 before -$2,000, you will lose your $100 three times out of four, but that one time you win, you get a $1,000 payout, meaning the expected value is positive even with a coin flip. That math has nothing to do with ICT or any so-called edge; it’s simply the payout structure making a random strategy profitable. 

Once you strip away the prop payout model and look at live trading, ICT doesn’t produce sustained profits, and that’s why after years of hype there are still no verifiable long-term broker statements to prove its validity.",23,70,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nd5m8c/the_truth_about_ict/,month,Discussion,0.74

If you think trading is just about charts and numbers, think again. It’s a brutal mirror to your emotions, discipline, and self-awareness. You can have the best strategy, but if you can’t handle the emotional rollercoaster—fear, greed, doubt—you’re toast.  

Perfectionists and grinders, listen up: trading doesn’t care about your work ethic or need for control. It rewards those who can let go, stay calm, and stick to their plan when the market’s screaming chaos. Master yourself first, or the market will do it for you.

1nqcf9f,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 13:07:18,10 Biggest Mistakes I Made My First Year (And How I Fixed Each One),"**An Autopsy of My First Year ( As requested by yall on my last post)**

My first year of trading was brutal. I thought I was going to get rich quick, but instead I stacked mistake after mistake. Looking back, that year and the 2nd was the most important part of my journey, because it forced me to learn the hard lessons that still guide me today and it helped me realize wehat syle and what markets fit me best!

Here are the 10 biggest mistakes I made and exactly how I fixed them:

1. Oversizing

I’d risk half my account on a single trade because I “knew” it was going to work. Of course, when it didn’t, I wiped out weeks of progress in seconds.

Fix: I committed to fixed risk per trade. Now I size everything in R multiples, win or lose, I know exactly what’s on the line. I styill have dynamic risk but its between 1-4% depending on the trade.

2. No stop losses

I used to believe I could “manage trades manually.” That always ended with me staring at a massive floating loss, hoping it would turn.

Fix: I set hard stops every trade. Even if it’s a painful stop out, it saves me from the catastrophic blowups. I sually tend to take reversals so I set my stop at the new high/low that was set.

3. Strategy hopping

Every week I’d be on YouTube chasing a new “holy grail” system. Supply and demand one week, moving averages the next, then order blocks, then RSI.

Fix: I picked one framework and committed to it for 6 months straight. Consistency of execution was more important than constantly chasing perfection. Backtested the hell out of it with a proper tool, nt just bar replay, then forward tested it.

4. Not journaling

I’d take 20 trades in a week and by Friday I couldn’t even remember half of them. There was no way to know if I was improving or just repeating mistakes.

Fix: I logged every trade, entry, stop, setup, and notes. Now I can look back and clearly see why a trade failed instead of guessing.

5. Trading when emotional

If I lost in the morning, I’d double size in the afternoon trying to make it back. If I was bored, I’d force trades just to “do something.”

Fix: I started tagging trades with emotions in my review. Over time, I noticed revenge trading patterns and cut them out. This was the hardest thing for me to beat. I would go on massive winning streaks but as soon as I had 2-3 lossed, I would go berzerk.

6. Chasing moves

I’d see a big candle rip and jump in late, only to get stopped out when price retraced. FOMO killed me more than bad setups or I would see my A+ setup playout for the day, then get pissed and chase some subpar trade.

Fix: I learned to mark levels ahead of time and wait for price to come to me. My best trades now feel “boring” because they’re planned hours in advance.

7. Ignoring time of day

I used to trade from open to close, thinking more screen time = more money. Instead, I just collected random losses.

Fix: By tracking trades by time, I saw most of my losses came between 8:30-10:30 PST. Now I avoid that window completely and focus on my profitable sessions.

8. No game plan

I’d wake up, open the chart, and hope something obvious would appear. Of course, that led to me forcing setups out of thin air.

Fix: I write a plan before every session with key levels, bullish/bearish scenarios, and triggers. If nothing lines up, I don’t trade and if I don't write a gameplan the day before or prte market, I also don't trade.

9. No weekly review

Every week bled into the next. I never connected the dots between what was working and what wasn’t. Half assing things DOES NOT work in dieting, training, trading or any aspect of life.

Fix: I do a weekend review where I group trades by setup, time, and outcome. That’s where the biggest breakthroughs come from, not daily PnL, but trends over time. I also spend time backtesting 1-2 week of data, every single week without missing a week for over 3 years now.

10. Expecting fast success

I thought I’d be consistent in 6 months. When it didn’t happen, I forced trades to “make up for lost time.” That mindset cost me more than any losing streak.

Fix: I accepted this is a 3-5 year or even longer game. Once I stopped rushing, I focused on the process instead of chasing quick wins. Do not put a time frame on this because that just adds more stress to you.

Trading will humble you. The key is letting those mistakes shape you instead of break you.

Not the ""let's try this set up on 5 trades"" style. Actual backtesting for a period of 1 year or more. The first strategy I tested was a video with 1M+ views from a channel called TradingLab. Not going to promote the video here because it honestly doesn't deserve it. It claims that it works in all markets, all time frames, high win rate, etc...

Anyway, here are the results on a 365 day backtest.

Max win rate of 38%. Don't be fooled by the solid ROI on the crypto assets. These assets appreciated \~100% over the last year, and this strategy was Long-only, so it actually underperforms simple ""buy and hold"" returns.

This probably doesn't come as a shock to most here, but I wanted to share it for transparency anyway. Maybe some strategy videos are legit, but this one definitely isn't. I'll post the analysis video in a comment below if you want to learn more about the strategy or copy the pine script for yourself.

Not the gurus you see, but real ones. They are out there but they are a different breed of person and they don’t have the capital constraints or feelings of money you possess.

If you are dealing with the psychological stresses of trading it’s because you are trading something you shouldn’t be doing.

I post this to show you all out there that are struggling and that think you cannot do it what real trading looks like. A lot people say a lot of things, but no one really shows something real. This is real. This is my trading in my ThinkOrSwim account, honestly I am not sure if this is all year or what the exact time frame because when I change the dates not much changes. BUT, this is my performance. I want to you to notice a few things. 

1. I cut losses quickly. 

2. I have several good gainers from my basic strategy

3. I get lucky and get a big winner every once in a while! 

This has been fairly consistent for me over the past several years, I was profitable in 2017 and I haven't looked back! I caught, TSLA, NVDA and now IONQ those have been my big winners. But as shown in the screenshot I can make good money in many other names. If your account can look anywhere near this in terms of your losers being small and your winners being big then you will be successful at trading. 

I think its paramount to 100% believe that you are taking the right approach, my strategy is a mix of things, its IBD breakouts with options with my own mix of things I have noticed and learned over the years. I believe in market themes and CHARTS. 

I ALSO TIME THE MARKETS for all you saying you cannot time the markets. No YOU can't time the markets, but people do it every day. I trade several other accounts as well and have 10's 4 accounts with just leveraged ETFs and market timing.

If you want to keep an edge, it’s less about guessing pumps and more about sharpening your understanding of how markets actually work.  
  
Trading has never been about luck, It comes down to knowledge, discipline, and strategy, Anyone can take a gamble, but the people who consistently improve are the ones who treat trading like a skill, They know when to stay patient, when to step in, and when to step out, That discipline is what separates someone who survives multiple cycles from someone who burns out.  
  
From my own experience, the most successful traders aren’t geniuses, they’re regular people who took time to learn, practice, and stick to their rules, I’ve been casually trading crypto for years, usually sticking to simple DCA strategies and avoiding anything too gamy.

It’s the hours spent in front of a screen while the rest of the world goes on without you. It’s friends not understanding why you’d rather journal your trades than go out. It’s family asking if this is “just a phase” while you quietly build a future they can’t imagine.



That silence is heavy but it’s also where the magic happens.



In the quiet, you find focus.

In the routine, you find strength.

In the loneliness, you find yourself.



Trading isn’t about noise, it’s about peace. The freedom you’re chasing won’t come from being understoo,it comes from doing the work when no one is watching.



So if you feel distant, disconnected, even misunderstood, know this: you’re not lost. You’re just walking a road most people will never dare to step on. And if you keep going, the freedom, the success, the peace… it will all be worth it.

1npr28s,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 19:12:36,My Top 5 rules that improved my stock trading performance,"These are my top 5 rules that improved my stock trading performance:

1. Minimize losses

You’ve probably heard that you should cut your losses, but the most important rule is to lose as little as possible. Keep your losses as small as you can.

Similar to a business, if you can keep your losses close to 0, it becomes “easy” to go from red to green.

2. Use a trailing stop

By using a trailing stop loss, you automate some of your risk and money management. The trailing stop also helps you achieve rule number 1, minimize losses!

3. Follow the trend

Trade with the trend, it is your friend. You’ve probably heard that as well, but it is true. Do not trade against the market, in the same way you shouldn’t swim against the flow of a river. Go with the flow, follow the trend. Find a good spot to enter and ride the wave.

4. Don’t try to time the market

If you could time the market, you’d be ultra rich. Instead of trying to time the market, follow your system, your rules and execute an entry or exit based on what your rules say.

5. Trade high probability setups

Wait for the high probability trade setups and only take those positions. Don’t gamble on noise, random setups. By taking high probability setups, it is much easier to turn a profit over time, while following the above rules of course.",13,9,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1npr28s/my_top_5_rules_that_improved_my_stock_trading/,month,Strategy,0.93
1nl59h3,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 10:35:15,Proving Daytrading Any Cryptocurrency is Possible!,"It took a really long time to find a strategy that works without making any personal analysis - just the indicators doing the work for you. I created customized indicators that mixes volume, statistics (i.e., kernel density estimation, etc), and conventional technical analysis equipment (i.e., fibonacci retracement, customized volume profile).

**Abstract**

I conducted a series of manual trades operating between August and September (\~2 months). I decided with 200 trades to create a robust sample size for reliability.

Listed on BINANCE, 26 cryptocurrencies were selected as part of the 200 trades via simple random sampling, with some stratification variability.

* SHELLUSDT.P, STRKUSDT.P, NOTUSDT.P, MYROUSDT.P, BRETTUSDT.P, MOODENGUSDT.P, DEGENUSDT.P, SPELLUSDT.P, BIGTIMEUSDT.P, PIPPINUSDT.P, ACHUSDT.P, OPUSDT.P, KAVAUSDT.P, GALAUSDT.P, DOGSUSDT.P, TRUMPUSDT.P, WUSDT.P, VETUSDT.P, TURBOUSDT.P, AAVEUSDT.P, ROSEUSDT.P, PENGUUSDT.P, REZUSDT.P, DOGEUSDT.P, XRPUSDT.P, and ENAUSDT.P

I started with $100.00 as my initial capital.

* RRR = 1:1
* Leverage: 5x
* Commission fees accounted for

Null hypothesis: The true win-rate is equal to random chance; = 0.50.

Alternative hypothesis: The true win-rate is greater than random chance; > 0.50.

**Results**

* Win-rate: 65.5% in 200 trades (Risk-to-reward ratio = 1:1)
* Net profit: +1552% (i.e., $100.00 -> $1552.41)

**Conclusion**

Test for statistical significance: one-sample proportion z-test

Level of significance: 5%

p-value ≈ 5.82 × 10⁻⁶

Interpretation: We reject the null hypothesis. The strategy's observed win-rate is statistically significantly higher than 50% at conventional significance levels (p = 0.00000582, 95% CI (0.587, 0.717)).

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok so now the abstract is done (just know that my results are not random). Below presents several charts that highlight interesting visuals.

Figure 5: Stratified per-symbol win-rate (bootstrapped)

[This one is interesting. It is important to note that ENAUSDT.P is only a sample size of 1, which happened to be a loss.](https://preview.redd.it/m9sp8bk8u4qf1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=db6aa7e197cf6f69c388068fd53941c266669373)

**Limitations**

This strategy was done by manual backtesting. Although objectivity was attempted to be maintained at all costs, they may still be possibility of potential losses that were missed during the backtesting period. However, this is unlikely due to the statistically significant result as shown by the p-value.

**My notes**

I kinda wanted to do this for a while and share to the community that daytrading any cryptocurrency and succeeding (without doing any personal analysis) is possible. It just takes a LOT of time. I am also incredibly surprised the effectiveness of fibonacci and volume profile, but according to my testing, it's not very significant. However, they do boost win rate a little bit.

Bit about me: I completed my Master's in Data Science, and a stock prediction project during that time got me hooked on trading.

Once I learned to just focus on my plan, things got a lot calmer. It became boring but that's what made the difference.

* Respect position sizing. If you’re risking too much per trade, you won’t survive the variance.
* Cut losers fast. Hoping for a reversal is how small losses turn into big ones.
* Daily loss limits exist for a reason. They save you from emotional spirals more than you realize.
* Revenge trading is a poison. Chasing back what you lost is usually how you lose even more.
* Zoom out. Focus on weeks/months of results, not whether *today* was green or red.

1nkt7bl,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 23:45:39,How backtesting changed everything for me.,"I want to share something I wish I understood way earlier in my trading journey: backtesting isn’t about finding the holy grail. It’s about gaining the confidence that your edge actually works and learning to trust it even when the market throws noise at you.

https://preview.redd.it/njy0vhrcm1qf1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee5b3f09ffeaa51aa20dc6782a6f5fdf7d595a7a

Over the last couple of months, I went all-in on backtesting my strategy. Here are my raw stats:



76 trades logged



Net P&L: $45,622.81



Trade win rate: 69.44%



Session win rate: 100% (8/8 sessions green)



Profit factor: 5.31



Trade expectancy: $634



Max drawdown: -$2,912



Average win vs loss: $1,120 vs -$481

https://preview.redd.it/8c15cetdm1qf1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=b710594127dac65dd936103e55e6bf50fb6e4c8d

The equity curve says it all, steady growth, small drawdowns (except one which is normal)  and compounding confidence.



What I Learned from Backtesting



The truth about “high win rate” strategies

Most strategies with 80-90% win rates look good short-term, but collapse once volatility shifts. I learned it’s not about being right every time, it’s about being consistent and protecting downside. My 40-70% win rate worked because my average win was more than double my average loss.



Drawdowns are inevitable

Even in a $45K stretch, I still faced a -$2,900 drawdown. Most traders quit at this point, thinking their strategy is broken. Backtesting taught me that drawdowns aren’t failure, they’re the cost of doing business.



20-30% annual returns are the sweet spot

The dream of doubling your account every year is usually what kills traders. But with backtesting, I saw firsthand that 20-30% annual returns, paired with prop firm capital, is enough to change your life. It’s not flashy, but it’s sustainable.



Confidence comes from data

When you’ve seen your setup play out across months of data, you stop second-guessing yourself in live trading. You stop jumping between strategies. You stop thinking every red day means you’re “broken.” 

I understand that live trading is definitly not the same as backtesting but any supplement of confidence can make a massive difference wehen you hit the markets and can help you preserve your money.



https://preview.redd.it/kap96iqfm1qf1.png?width=1702&format=png&auto=webp&s=7692d735092de28ce0c4199b5b8ce0896ee4c44c

Why Backtesting Changed My Mindset



Before, I’d take a couple of live trades, lose, and assume my edge was gone. I’d switch indicators, try a new YouTube setup, or even buy a course, lord knows I got scammed on so many courses, and some usefuul but just did not resonate with me.



Now, I know that my strategy has a proven expectancy. I know what my win rate is, I know what my drawdowns look like, and I know what kind of return I can expect if I stick with it. That kind of conviction is what separates traders who last from traders who blow up.



Backtesting also made me realize how much time I was wasting in Excel. Logging every trade manually, trying to track profits/losses, drawdowns, win rates… it became a headache. 



Final Thoughts



If you’re serious about trading, backtest your strategy. Not one weekend, not just 20 trades, do it for months. Track everything. Look at expectancy, drawdowns, and long-term performance.

If you want a plan, do it for a full 3months, every single day, go through bullish and bearish marlet cycles, see what ticker or if futures/forex works best for you.



There’s no holy grail strategy. But there is a holy grail process:



Build a simple edge.



Backtest it.



Refine it.



Gain confidence in it.



Then execute it in real-time with discipline.



I’ll leave you with this: your confidence as a trader will never come from watching someone else’s chart, it comes from seeing your own edge play out over and over again.



Now I’m curious:

For those of you who’ve backtested your own setups, what was the biggest realization you had?

I know some genius traders will try and tell me how the lack of consistency is with my style but I have mastered my style and for the most part of this year there were completely no setups, the market was very dry. Trading for me will forever remain a side hustle to get some windfall cash once in a while but it's a completely unreliable business model. You are not going to be paying your monthly recurring bills with it. The other thing is unless you are using a well trained bot to replace you, you always have to be there, if you are sick or have moods you make no money due to a high risk of human error. I think other business models are better because with those you can implement systems and AI easily that help it run around the clock. Take for example an online business where you create a website that does the selling for you. You can outsource product creation and you automate prospecting through running ads, all you have to do is manage the system and by this you are just watching out and controlling anomalies that may make the revenue go off track other than that you are free and the money is coming in as you do other stuff. Once you put in the upfront effort you can sit back and relax.  The business runs the majority of the time without you.Trading is not like that once you learn it you still need to be actively participating in it. The worst part about trading is once you have spent time honing these skills for years thinking it's going to be your way out of poverty you realize the skills you have been polishing are not transferrable to another industry, they are extremely niche. So if you are unable to become profitable you are fucked and have wasted a considerable amount of time and money learning something that is very restricted in industry application.This is why it generates alot of scammers, people start with good intentions hoping they will be rich, they realize its difficult to learn, they have spent years and money trying to master it but are still not profitable and that is when they realize this business aint it and they need to make up for all the time and money lost, so they decide to become the shovel sellers, selling shovels to the people going after the gold rush.",10,135,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nuzhw3/my_opinion_about_tradingchange_my_mind/,month,Discussion,0.64

I wanted to combine my interest in finance, art, and app dev, so I came up with a different type of stock market simulator, where you learn about investing by collecting creatures!

You can enter real stock tickers and decide whether to long/short, and each stock will represent either a bull (long) or bear (short).

Speaking from personal experience, I believe financial literacy and an early understanding of markets can be incredibly valuable for students as they prepare for the future. My prototype still needs a lot of refining, so I would appreciate any feedback!

Here’s the app's core mechanic: you make real stock price predictions. If you think a stock will go up (i.e. “long” a stock), you hatch a bull; if you think it’ll go down (i.e., “short” a stock), you hatch a bear. If your prediction is wrong, your creature loses health, but you can use potions to heal it. Each potion teaches a basic investing concept, like how earnings reports or interest rates affect prices, while improving your creature’s stats. You can also level up for evolution. It’s kind of like Duolingo meets Tamagotchi, but for the stock market.

1ndgz9h,2025-09-10,2025-09-10 11:15:27,Gold's Rally is Hitting Statistically Rare Levels. I Ran the Backtest on What Happens Next.,"With Gold (GCF) having such a strong run, I decided to check my quantitative models to see how this price action compares to historical data. It turns out, today is a pretty significant day. It's not just one, but a cluster of several different indicators that are all hitting rare, extreme levels simultaneously.

I've been backtesting these signals over decades of data, and I wanted to share what has happened in the past when these specific conditions were met. The results show a fascinating (and conflicting) story for the short vs. long term.

The Short-Term Case: A Historical Pullback

One of the most powerful signals that flashed today is price reaching the 99th percentile above its 20-day moving average. In simple terms, this means Gold is currently stretched extremely far above its recent average price—an event that has only happened 36 times in the past.

When this happens, it's historically been a signal for a short-term pullback. Here’s the data:

•	⁠Avg. 1-Week Return: -1.98% •	⁠Win Rate (Profitability): Only 26% of the time 
•	⁠Statistical Significance (p-value): 0.0014. This is highly significant, suggesting the negative result is not random chance.

The data for the 1-day, 3-day, and 2-week periods also shows negative average returns, all with high statistical significance. This suggests that, historically, a breather or consolidation is very common after such a sharp move up.

The Long-Term Case: A Bullish Outlook

This is where it gets interesting. While the short-term indicators point to a pullback, the models looking at longer-term trends are flashing bullish.

For example, two other signals that triggered today are price hitting the 93rd percentile above its 100-day moving average and the Daily RSI hitting the 98th percentile. These signals have a much more positive track record over the following months.

Let's look at the 100-Day SMA (93rd Percentile) signal. It has occurred 47 times previously:

•	⁠Avg. 3-Month Return: +4.61% •	⁠Avg. 6-Month Return: +9.12% •	⁠Avg. 1-Year Return: +12.77% •	⁠Win Rates: The win rate climbs to 65% at 3 months, 79% at 6 months, and 82% at 1 year. 
•	⁠Statistical Significance: The p-values for these longer timeframes are extremely low (all ≤ 0.0003), indicating very high confidence in the historical pattern.

The Daily RSI (98th Percentile) signal tells a similar story, with an average 6-month return of +5.42% and a 1-year return of +9.69%, both with high statistical significance.

Conclusion

My quantitative models, which analyze decades of historical data, suggest a conflicting but actionable story for Gold right now:

1.	⁠⁠⁠Short-Term (Next 1-2 weeks): The data points to a high probability of a pullback or consolidation. The price is at statistically extreme levels above its short-term moving average, which has historically resolved with a brief dip.
2.	⁠⁠⁠Long-Term (3-12 months): The data suggests that this pullback could be a buying opportunity. Indicators based on longer-term trends show a strong historical tendency for Gold to be significantly higher 6 to 12 months after these types of signals trigger.

Obviously, past performance is not a guarantee of future results, but it's fascinating to see what the data says. It seems we're at a critical inflection point.

I've read awful things about the transition. That brokers cheat a lot, that CFDs are created to let brokers scam you, that futures are better because the market is real rather than replicated.

The business of trading is simple.
Find trends, ride it till it ends.
Doesn’t matter what setup you use to enter, pick one, stick to that shit.
Cut losses the moment your idea is invalidated. 
Protect mental capital at all costs. Why would you sit around for days in the red. Just cut that shit and go on to live another day, stress free. You can always enter again.
Scale into winners, that’s how you make the big bucks. Gradual exposure to a winning trade, not by doubling down on a looser cuz you think it’s gonna bounce.

This business is always going to have an element of discretion and feel. Do what you can to add structure but learning to feel the market is not a science. It’s energy, it’s flow, it’s market sentiment. Add whatever technicals you want but you can’t pinpoint an abstract thing. BUT, you will fail without some kind of structure. So accept that paradox of the market. 

You will never know what is going to happen next. Do whatever analysis you want. Crunch all the numbers. Read all the news. But when you put on risk, expect that you will loose.

This shit takes time. It’s a skill. Clicking the button isn’t the skill, it’s everything behind the click. Any avg joe can make money once, but to make it consistently, through many market storms, is what makes someone a trader. When times are good, everyone makes money.

This is not a hit piece; it's to promote critical thinking and expose you to points and evidence you've likely never seen before. In less than 10 minutes of reading time, I aim to cover it all.  
Definitions **\[4\]** and sources **\[5\]** are available at the bottom paired with a summary.  
**This post will be purely about psychology \[1\], narrative flaws \[2\] and data analysis principles \[3\]**

# WAIT!

**This post is a critique, not an attack. Actionable insights are provided**

This doesn't come from a place of ignorance. I don't debate what I don't know. This post is in good faith.

Many people choose to dismiss ICT as a ""fraud"", but let’s look into it together.

 **""Smart Money Concepts"" \[1\]**

# The institutional story & why retail traders find it appealing

ICT, to most retail traders, is convincing; by design, it helps them feel reassured and in control; it subconsciously satisfies your psychological needs if you believe in the theory, which is desirable but not beneficial for most.

**This study shows that most humans are even willing to give up financial gain to feel in control.**

The value of control

Moritz Reis, Roland Pfister, Katharina A. Schwarz

I'm sure you can relate if you are a discretionary ICT trader or an ex-ICT trader; the **Ad-hoc reasoning** makes the trader feel like they know what’s happening in the market(s) they’re trading and why things have taken place, present and past. The **hindsight bias** is also brutal due to the excesssive number of entry methods provided.

**The need for control is innate in us; it's how we're wired as humans.**

The data snooping across multiple timeframes displayed by most discretionary ICT traders makes it conveniently harder to expose again, by design.

**ICT/SMC is convoluted and discretionary likely on purpose, making it difficult for people to refute. It often presents like a shared belief system, rather than a straight forward replicable framework.**

**The burden of proof** constantly gets shifted, and circular reasoning pops up. ICT is designed to feel underpinned by logic and complex, but it’s mostly a mixture of heuristics and untestable narratives.

# SMC theory goes against market fundamentals [2]

[MMXM](https://preview.redd.it/kn35ycivtwqf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=463f698e663f27bc13df5b312324e565dc85598c)

**ICT example of supposed ""Market Maker Behaviour""**

https://preview.redd.it/iu4w6gvwtwqf1.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cd2c95d0b0adc548350558e622feee45fad6482

**Realistic Market Maker Behaviour**

**Market makers rarely engineer large movements over several ticks because of inventory risk.**

**I have provided institutional-grade literature which explains this in-depth towards the end.**

Understand that i'm not saying “stop hunting” never happens; it’s just rare and misrepresented by trading gurus to an extreme point. An MM moving price by a point to “sweep” liquidity is not the same as an MM moving price by 10+ points to induce/sweep liquidity; it's far too risky for them to do that, with rare exceptions.  
Even a 10-point move on index futures is large for a market maker.

**Here is an example (Futures):**

Let's make the current price 20010.00 and the price in focus 20000.00. -10 handles.  
If a predictive HFT MM Algo anticipates they'll be 3000 contracts 10 handles / $10 away from the current price and the algo anticipates the market impact per handle to be 200, leaving a +1000 contract discrepancy if the price is met, they wouldn't commit the 2000 contracts to spike the price most of the time even though it's logical because the inventory risk accumulation or chance of adverse selection would be too high even if they spread it out.

**They could be stuck with -2000 contracts on the wrong side of the market and lose a lot of money; all it takes is for a different algorithm to match their flow to nullify their market impact completely.**

**Here's the nuance, though:** if the price was already trading at that point that's $10 away from the current price and their predictive model still supports the decision they could provide liquidity at 20000.00 but also influence the price to trigger the orders but only if close and highly probable. For example, if the price is at 20000.50, they could sell a couple of hundred to flush the final buyers to trigger the anticipated order flow.

**The point is it's extremely unlikely for Market makers to influence larger movements/spikes to tap into anticipated liquidity unless the level is extremely close to where price discovery is taking place already. So it's the other market participants trading towards that level; that's the true causation, not the MMs.**

Some ICT traders will win; an overwhelming majority will lose. Even if all PD Arrays were ""applied correctly"" & if everyone traded ICT the exact same way, they'd be market crowds that'd be faded and cause alpha decay if there was any edge to begin with.

Note: Alpha decay is when a strategy loses its edge from being well known and executed.

I'm sure small market crowds from ICT trading behaviour already exist and are occasionally arbitraged by algos due to margin/trade size used & retail popularity. Predictable crowd flow gets faded. It’s not a conspiracy; it’s an industry fact.

# I've seen ICT work for others, so it must work, right? [3]

**This is a survivorship bias classic.**

[Traders still have a chance to make money with losing strategies](https://preview.redd.it/0kh6l9d3uwqf1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=62aed3c72c6d66c05d2fa11ec21e5fa9910ae840)

**As you can see here traders can make money with unprofitable strategies not Break-even. unprofitable.**

Anecdotal examples ≠ viability. Anecdotes don't hold weight.

If blackjack is rigged against the player, how come some gamblers made millions in Vegas without card counting? Ex. Dana White

Because it's a numbers game, and it all averages out.

Most ICT traders are losing money just like most gamblers in Vegas. But the wins are what's displayed, not the guy who lost his house in 100 hands.

It's the same thing with trading poorly modelled ideas, like most discretionary applications of ICT.

A few outliers will always exist; anecdotes do not replace systematic evidence.

There are academic-grade papers showing even coin flips can have periods of profitability coincidentally.

[Much more variance in outcomes is shown with zero edge](https://preview.redd.it/o21y1mo8uwqf1.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=0513aa7bba6bbadff4ad2cd8673cde7d719a69e6)

Most ICT traders don't collect first-party data on rule-based strategies (executed mechanically or with discretion); this is their downfall.

Few are the exception.

# Analogy (going deeper) [3]

SMC is like a “science” that never gets a fair test. The post isn’t to provoke and upset it’s to educate it’s not opinion it’s based on facts and visual evidence.

**ICT deals with time series data (OHLC), so data science rules do apply, but ICT’s application of “his concepts” violates standard data analysis principles. Whilst still having the illusion of rigour**

Price discovers quotes; it doesn’t “deliver them”. You’re wasting your time with theory. Half of what ICT says about inefficiency is correct; unfortunately, the rest of it is noise.

E/EV is the average net return per trade ex 1:2 with a 50% winrate is 0.5R avg profit per trade. E.g. (-1+2-1+2)/4 = 0.5R avg gain

[ICT DISTILLATION TOWER \(Analogy\)](https://preview.redd.it/baekswfduwqf1.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=b711296a78dac92b4850cbbf61aa740a148e2a17)

Think of ICT like fractional distillation, but you have a range of temperatures where you can extract a substance instead of the specific temperature required. Only a loose guide. That’s similar to data snooping and the other data science flaws when applied.

The point is you might still get the substance you need from the distillation process but a lot of excess time and energy is wasted because you don’t apply the correct amount of heat, etc.

That’s how I feel about ICT concepts. Decent, unoriginal techniques, but there's a lot of noise during the application.

If you want to know how prices really work look at books and papers talking about **liquidity provision, price discovery** and **market auctions** for the truth.

# Definitions [4]:

Alpha Decay  
When a trading strategy loses its edge because too many people use it or the market adapts. Any advantage gets diluted or arbitraged away over time, especially when strategies are shared publicly.

Julien Penasse - Understanding alpha decay

Ad hoc reasoning is when someone makes up an explanation on the spot to justify or defend their belief or theory; typically, after the fact in an ICT context, it’s usually tied to hindsight bias.

Anecdotal Evidence

Personal stories or isolated examples. Common in retail (""I saw someone make $1M prop firm withdrawals using SMC!""), but not reliable proof of a strategy’s viability.

First-party Data

Data collected directly from a trader’s own trades. Backtests or forward tests; not taken from others' results or community anecdotes. As I’ve suggested, high-quality, first-party data is essential for knowing if a system actually has an edge. A Key marker for strategy substance.

Coin Flip Analogy  
Used in this to reveal that even completely random methods can appear profitable in the short term due to chance. Useful for exposing how randomness/noise can be mistaken for skill in financial markets.

Data Snooping (in trading)

Inconsistently looking at the same data (chart) multiple times over multiple timeframes and scenarios to justify a trade. Discretionary traders often do this to fish for “confluence” to validate their trading idea.

Burden of Proof

The responsibility to provide evidence for a claim. In trading especially, it should always fall on the person promoting a strategy, not the skeptic asking for proof it’s effective.

Hindsight Bias  
When a trader believes, after a trade’s outcome is known, that they would’ve known the result. Common in discretionary trading and journaling, where charts are reviewed after moves happen, making everything look obvious in retrospect, especially with ICT.

Survivorship Bias  
Focusing primarily on the positive events/wins while ignoring the majority of instances, which are negative. In trading, it's when people point to profitable traders using a method (typically baseless) without acknowledging how many used the same method and lost money.

Circular Reasoning  
The logical fallacy where the conclusion is included in the premise. In trading, a good example is saying a method works because it works, without solid evidence. Often shows up in unverified trading strategies. (no quality first-party data)

# Summary/TLDR Can ICT/SMC be salvaged and used?

Many of the ideas are weak, but VERY few take advantage of actual short-term market inefficiencies, so if you insist on using it, you must do high-quality first-party backtesting first, per setup, per instrument, which takes a lot of work. An overwhelming majority of ICT traders skip this; that's their downfall.

If you insist on using “ICT’s ideas”, which we don’t, just like anything, make sure you rigorously test it on every instrument you run individually without tweaks or curve fitting. Or you don’t know how effective it really is or if it has any edge at all. **Unfortunately, ICT shares the same structural weaknesses as many retail systems: heavy discretion in most applications, limited first-party testing and heightened potential exposure to alpha decay.**

[Real Backtesting Data Example](https://preview.redd.it/o57evfniuwqf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c2786e85d235e13de99e65115060c50c04c7f83)

If you're going to use ICT make purely mechanical trading strategies based on logic rather than narrative skip things like MMXM and focus on more basic setups like breakers, mitigation, fvg and so on and build from there. If you are going to do multiple timeframe analysis use the same timeframes in the same order, per setup for consistent execution priority and to prevent look-ahead bias.

Just wanted to share my weekend routine for swing trading and see if anyone else does something similar—or is interested in my process!

Each weekend, I go through the US stock market looking for 1-3 stocks to swing trade in the coming week. My main tool is the EMA (Exponential Moving Average), and I use a filter I built to help narrow down the list from thousands of stocks.

My criteria are pretty simple:

* The stock should have a clear trend (not just moving sideways).
* It should be pulling back toward the EMA21 or EMA55, which is where I like to enter.
* I avoid anything that looks overbought.

This process helps me focus on stocks that are trending but not too stretched.

I love how, once you learn the basics, it’s all about predicting where the price action is heading based on probability — which I find really cool. The more I get into it, the more I want to leave my crane internship and my mentor behind to focus full-time on trading. 

My construction job varies week to week—sometimes I work 80 hours, other times only 40, but usually it’s between 40 and 80 hours. I’ve been at this job for almost six months now. Honestly, I don’t even love the construction work; I kind of hate it. It’s exhausting, and I just feel like I could be doing something more fulfilling, like trading at home because it’s fun.

I also have about $7,000 saved up, which I think could give me some room to learn and grow as a trader without risking everything right away. I’m considering going back to serving and studying full-time, like I did before I got into construction, since my schedule makes it tough to trade in the mornings when I work. I don’t have debt, but my dad struggles with alcohol dependence and depression, which is really tough emotionally. Sometimes I worry he might pass away suddenly, and that scares me. On the other hand, I feel like I should’ve done more to help him, and that’s been weighing on me.

My crane mentor really supports me and keeps saying I’ll be a great crane operator. I think it’s mostly because he appreciates my go-getter attitude and work ethic, but honestly, can all that hard work not go into trading instead? I’m only 21, but I can’t shake the feeling that I could’ve done more with my life. I don’t even really know why I got into construction in the first place—maybe I thought it was the safe or expected thing, but my real passion is trading.

I want to build a life trading because that’s what excites me, not construction or crane work.

If the rate cuts occur, starting 9.17.25, it could rocket the markets. I started with 2.6k USD, now I'm down about 50% in total. But I didn't follow any paid groups, I made the typical mistakes, FOMO, getting in late on the pumps and the dumps, being right about the trade but had too small of a stop loss. Getting rugged, not using risk management or stop losses. Putting too much faith in influencers or traders because they had a good winning streak. What I would say is always use stop losses, if you're unsure of a potential pump and don't want to risk trading futures, just stick to spot. You'll be way more profitable to be honest unless you've built up the experience. Also, trading with $1000 than $100 will most likely have more of an effect on you if something happens. So adjust your strategies as you build up, pay attention to your emotions and keep the greed balanced. I've learned using Bollinger Bands on a 30, and RSI 13 on a 1 hour chart seems to be more accurate in deciding which way the market will go. Cut out the noise, most crypto people are just influencers bull posting news or trends. So far the ones that seem to give out decent or more solid trades, whether bullish or bearish on X are KookCapitalLLC, astekz, Nstr\_tj, EasyEatsBodega, wizardofsoho. My strategy now is to not take any gambles on memes, just stick to the tokens/tikkers I've mentioned in the beginning, use low leverage for bigger stop loss margins when trading futures and not adding funds to the account, more like a test to myself to learn, build it up. Another token I do hold is XRP, there's rumors the Rothschilds are behind it, Ripple's implementation in banks and the billions bought by people recently. Also, Blackrock holds MOG and SPX. The big entities are buying billions in assets such as Ethereum so they can stake and just live off the passive income. Soon they'll own it all and sell it to the normies at a high price, furthering the enslavement. The crypto global adoption is only 3% I think, if the market booms, I think it be worth to be early and dabble a bit in this space.

4H → price kept breaking highs + trickling up. So unless I have signs that supply takes control I will be only focusing on buys.

15M → started the day neutral, but once demand regained control, I looked for a liquidity sweep + LTF confirmations.

Entry → with demand in control, I only needed a sweep + confirmation. After the 15M IRL sweep, waited for last point of supply to fail then market executed the long position.

1nqqzzc,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 23:32:49,Backtest results from a neural network,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a personal project I've been working on. This isn't a post to sell anything or promise crazy returns, but rather a showcase of a robust machine learning framework I've developed. The goal was to see if I could build a process that generates a real, verifiable edge, even under difficult market conditions.

For this test, I chose ETHUSD specifically because its price action was choppy and difficult for a significant portion of the backtest period. Here are the high-level results:

    ==================================================
     Results for: v1.9 Daily Model on ETHUSD
     Strategy: 'dynamic_threshold' (T+1 Pricing)
     Date Range: 2024-06-20 to 2025-01-01
    ==================================================
    Starting Capital: $1,000.00
    Ending Capital:   $2,065.49
    Total Return:     106.55%
    --------------------------------------------------
    Total Trades:     41
    Win Rate:         65.85%
    Profit Factor:    6.68
    Max Drawdown:     -8.17%
    ==================================================
    

Now, I know the first reaction to any backtest is skepticism, as it should be. Here are the three most important things about the methodology behind these numbers:

**1. This isn't just a one-off strategy; it's a generalizable framework.** The model's features are based on a proprietary method I developed called the TCXA framework, which models the underlying ""grammar"" of market structure. The same feature engineering and training pipeline that produced this ETH model gets similar results on every asset I've trained it on - BTC, ADA, DOGE. The system is a ""model factory,"" not a single, curve-fit strategy.  

**2. It's rigorously tested on out-of-sample data.** This is not a case of training and testing on adjacent data. The model used for this backtest was trained on data from **2016 through the end of 2023**. The test period you see above begins in **June 2024**, leaving a **6-month gap** of unseen data between training and testing. This is a crucial step to ensure the model has learned real patterns, not just memorized recent price action.  In other tests, I've trained form 2014-2018, tested for 2024 and still got results.  Not as good, but comparable.

**3. The backtest is realistic and free of lookahead bias.** This is the most important point. I've spent more time on the data integrity and MLOps pipeline than on the model itself.

* **No Lookahead:** I have verified that the features generated on historical data are **bit-for-bit identical** to the features the system generates in a live environment.  
* **Conservative T+1 Execution:** The backtest uses a pessimistic ""T+1"" fill model. This means the decision to trade is made at the close of one candle (T), but the trade is simulated as executing on the *next* candle (T+1). To account for slippage and market friction, all buys are filled at the **high** of that next candle, and all sells are filled at the **low**. This ensures the model's edge is strong enough to survive real-world execution conditions.

Here are the visuals for the test period:

**(Equity Curve)**

Using this system, I'm able to train models that predict at all sorts of different timeframes.  This is one of my longer term models - it predicts the return for the next 24 hours every hour.  I am in the process of developing one of these models to post automated trade signals for BTC/USD in real time through my X account, this model is meant to operate at a frequency that a person following it on X could realistically keep up with.  When it's ready I'll write a new post showing recent backtesting details for the specific model it's running.  Until then I'm happy to answer questions.

I took a break, then used some money I had saved up to try again. That’s when I found TJR’s bootcamp, which pulled me into futures trading. Through him, I learned about prop firms.

I’ve blown probably 40 accounts and lost thousands of dollars. My turning point was when I stopped trying to learn every little thing about trading — whether it was on TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube. I cut all of it out and just stuck to one model (still TJR’s trading model), just with a different form of entry and a slightly different way of viewing it.

Once I cut the noise out and focused on one model, I was able to turn profitable and pass accounts easily.

The only tips I have are: FIND A MENTOR AND STICK TO IT. And find a community or someone who can hold you accountable for your actions. Once you master your strategy — whatever it may be — it’s all about psychology.

Recently, I have realised that I have got everything in line psychology, risk management, time frame to trade on, journalling, etc. One bottleneck, since a long time has been no confidence in my strategy, to earn 50% win rate. Brief background, I am an intraday trader, trade with 15mins candles, in the Indian stock market. I have expectation to have a 50% win rate and a 1:2RR. I am also mentally strong enough to bare the DD and I accept the loss as it is nothing but the trade went on the other side of the probability and accept that won or loss in this is not in my control but, over a period of time, I will have a decent win rate. 

The problem: 
I have tried a lot of times to understand that price and patterns are formed by market participants psychology and tried to make sense of it but, I can't logically accept the fact that traders and investors are looking at the trendline and reacting at that level. I firmly believe that whatever actions they are taking is based on the new update about that company or generally which led them to make the decision. Traders takes the action with or after an investor has made his action to a update. I believe that in the past if people sold the stock at 100, doesn't mean this time also they will sell at 100. this makes no sense to me. I have worked at an investment firm and investors don't make decisions based on the levels. In short, I don't believe past traders and investors actions will have any influence on the current or future actions but a new update will. My edge will come from me reacting on that update first and then other people reacting will shoot the price up and I will make money. But, here also I am not sure if I will have a 50% prob or not and just not sure what to do. I do believe in swings and keep at stops at the swing lows.

It trades mainly EUR/USD and GBP/USD on the 1m/5m charts, during the London/NY overlap when spreads are tight.

On good days, the bot has pulled in up to $120 profit, though the daily average is lower. It usually takes 15–20 trades a day, with a win rate around 60%. Biggest drawdown I’ve seen so far in one day was about 3%.

1nee1za,2025-09-11,2025-09-11 12:54:27,Trading competition,"
Hey everyone,

I took part in a trading competition last week and wanted to share my results. My strategy revolves heavily around market sentiment and order flow/volume, which makes trading around high-impact news releases essential for my edge.

This approach allowed me to turn a $100k starting balance into $129,144 – a +29.14% gain in just 5 trading days.

However, I was disqualified. Here’s the full story:

I was long on Gold (XAU/USD) based on my pre-news analysis of sentiment and the evolving volume profile, strongly predicting a move up. My read on the market was correct – it did shoot up exactly as anticipated.

But during the initial moments of the news chaos, the price experienced a violent, short-lived liquidity spike down before rocketing up. This spike caused massive slippage, triggering my stop-loss at a far worse level than I had set.

This single event breached the competition's strict maximum daily drawdown rule, leading to an automatic DQ. It's a classic case of execution risk invalidating a correct market read.

Despite the DQ, I believe the performance speaks for the strategy itself, especially Friday where I made +$10,864 on a single trade by capitalizing on these very factors.

I've attached my stats below. I'm happy to talk about how I gauge sentiment, read volume, or how to manage risk around high-impact events. Ask me anything!",6,3,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nee1za,month,Discussion,1.0

1ny7n6l,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 18:34:11,The Hooligan Playbook Chapter 3.5,"The Ledger is not an X-Y graph. It is not a cartoon grid. It is a table. One column holds the
Edge Index. One column holds Conviction. The row where they meet gives the Operator a
command.

The Edge Index is the score. Conviction is the side. When the Index is positive, Conviction
leans buy side. When the Index is negative, Conviction leans sell side. When the Index hugs
zero, you are in the shadows.

The Edge Index can be built from price action, but it is not chained to it. The Operator has
freedom to pull in whatever signals they can measure with consistency.

Structure, momentum, and liquidity sweeps might be the foundation. Volatility regimes,
sector rotations, and relative strength between markets can add weight.

If you have access to flow data, open interest, or positioning, those can be factored as well.
The Index is not about using one indicator. It is about reducing chaos to a single number that
is scored the same way every time.

Conviction comes from direction. Sometimes it mirrors the Index. Sometimes it is tested
against a higher timeframe. A trader might have a session-level Index of +3, but if the weekly tape is rejecting new highs, Conviction is marked down. The Ledger captures that friction.

The Operator sees the tension, and the table tells them to size down or wait.

Think of the Ledger as a war table. Across the top are Conviction states: strong buy, weak
buy, neutral, weak sell, strong sell. 

Down the side are Index bands: +4 to +5, +2 to +3, –2 to -3, –4 to –5. Where they cross, the table holds a command. Trade full size. Trade partial. Hedge. Do nothing.

Examples make it real.

Spot Trading: The Index reads +4. Conviction is bullish. The Ledger allows long spot with up
to one percent of risk capital. The Operator buys on pullback into broken resistance. If the
Index fades to +2, risk is cut in half. If it collapses to zero, the table says flatten.

Options: The Index reads +3. Conviction is bullish. The Ledger authorizes call debit spreads with moderate size. If the Index pushes to +4, the Operator can roll the short leg higher or scale in. If the Index fades to +1, the Ledger commands exit.

Mixed Read: The Index reads +2, but Conviction is bearish due to higher-timeframe
rejection. The Ledger commands a half-sized short. In spot, that might be a small starter
position. In options, a bear call spread with tight risk. If the higher timeframe falls back in line with the Index, Conviction shifts and the table allows more size.

The Ledger is built to kill emotion. It does not ask how you feel about Powell, or what Twitter
is screaming. It does not ask whether you are scared or greedy. It only cares about your
numbers and your direction. If they align, you act. If they conflict, you size down or wait. If
they vanish, you disappear.

The Ledger is not about being right. It is about being consistent. If you obey it, you survive. If
you betray it, you bleed.

Here’s what a Ledger might look like on paper. This is not the Ledger you will build. This is
only an example to show how the table works.

+4 to +5 Bullish: Press long, full size
+2 to +3 Bullish: Trade long, half size
0 to +1 Neutral: Probe small or wait
–2 to –3 Bearish: Trade short, half size
–4 to –5 Bearish: Press short, full size

Worked Example (Spot)
The Index prints +3. Conviction is bullish. The Ledger says: half-sized long. The Operator
buys spot ETH on a pullback, risks 0.5% of capital, and plans to scale if Index lifts to +4. If
the Index fades to +1, the Ledger says cut. No emotion. Only the table

Why This Is Only an Example.

If every Operator ran the same Ledger, the machine would sniff it out and hunt it. The market feeds on predictable order flow. Your survival depends on your Ledger being yours. The structure above shows how a table gives commands, but the inputs, the weighting, and the calibration must be your own. That’s the firewall. That’s what keeps you hidden in the
shadows.",1,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ny7n6l/the_hooligan_playbook_chapter_35/,new,Discussion,1.0

Here's my weekend routine:

**Saturday: Review the week**

* Go through every trade I took - wins AND losses
* What did I miss? What economic events actually moved my pairs?
* Journal the emotions around each trade (this is harder than it sounds)

**Sunday: Look ahead**

* Check the economic calendar for the week - which releases actually matter for my pairs?
* Read up on what's happening macro economically in the currencies I trade (central bank speeches, geopolitical developments, GDP reports coming up)
* Review my open positions with fresh eyes - do they still make sense given what's coming this week?
* Make forecasts on my main pairs based on fundamentals, not just technicals

**The key shift:** I used to only look at charts and indicators. Now I spend more time understanding WHY currencies might move, not just predicting THAT they'll move.

It's not as fun as watching price action. But understanding the economic drivers behind currency movements has cut my losing weeks significantly.

I’m a trader (mostly discretionary, some algo) exploring if there is demand for a stat based terminal focused purely on **patterns, events, and price action** (less on fundamentals).

All analysis would be statistically grounded with minimal AI usage (certainly not for the math/backtesting part)

You’d be able to enter natural-language queries like:

1. What happened the last time QQQ went down 3 days in a row?
2. What happened when AAPL closed up 3% three days straight?
3. META is down 7 days in a row, QQQ is up — analyze what happened next (1 week, 1 month).
4. Show me how NVDA performs after earnings gaps of ≥ 3%.
5. List the tickers that rebound most after 5 red days in a row.
6. What’s the average SPY return the week after CPI beats expectations?
7. For the last month has OPEN rallied more in the morning session, overnight session, or PM session?

After entering a query you would get a full backtest, 5+ years with average trade, sharpe, profit factor, charts, etc.

**Looking for honest feedback:**

1. Is this something you’d actually pay for?
2. What kinds of queries or stats would be most valuable to you? (1-7, or others)

I recently invested in a new GPU, an RTX 5070 Ti,  with the goal of using it to train AI models.

I’m a full-stack software developer with over 12 years of experience, so I’m comfortable with Python and machine learning fundamentals.

I decided to work with a Transformer-based model and I’m using tools like Weights & Biases (W&B) and Optuna for tracking and optimization. However, I’ve hit a bottleneck with the features I’m using to train the model.

I’ve experimented with multiple feature sets and even explored feature engineering with ChatGPT, but I’m currently stuck at a 56-57% success rate, which isn’t good enough for what I’m aiming for.

I’ve tried 5-minute, 15-minute, and 30-minute timeframes, but none have made a noticeable difference. I’ve also tested common indicators such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands, among others.

I’d really appreciate any advice or insights on the following:

Is a Transformer model a good choice for this type of problem?

What would be an optimal target definition (for example, 2× ATR profit)?

Which features or indicators tend to be the most valuable?

Which timeframe is most effective for training in this context?

Any tips and tricks?


I’m open to collaboration and happy to share the project if you can provide valuable insights that help improve performance. Any constructive advice or feedback is highly appreciated.

Most traders lose because they do not have rules. They trade on impulse, they chase the last candle, they flip bias three times before lunch. The market feeds on that chaos. The brokers encourage it because every click pays them. The gurus cheer it on because every loss keeps you buying their signals. Without the Ledger you are food.

attack. When the Index is tangled, the Ledger says stand down. You do not waste bullets,
you do not get trapped in the churn. You live to fight another day.

Compounding only works if you are still in the game. That is the part nobody wants to hear.
Everybody talks about doubling accounts and chasing ten baggers, but you cannot compound if you are dead. The Ledger is what keeps you alive long enough for math to take

The Ledger also matters because it kills emotion. Traders blow up when they confuse
conviction with hope. They stay in losers, they press against strength, they fight the tape.
The Ledger cuts that out. It says what to do and you either do it or you don’t. If you betray it, you know why you lost. If you follow it, you build discipline with every trade.

them active, the numbers prove they lose, and the blood machine drains them dry. The

Each one has the same information. Each one runs the Ledger in their own way.

Operator One wakes up and runs the Edge Index. The score is strong, momentum is aligned, volatility is steady. Conviction points bullish. The Ledger gives the command: press long.

Operator One sizes in, not recklessly but with purpose. When price pulls back, they scale.
When the move extends, they hold. The day ends green, not because of luck but because
the Ledger told them to act with size when the stars lined up.

Operator Two runs the same Index. The score is tangled, momentum sideways, volatility
unstable. Conviction is flat. The Ledger gives a different command: do nothing. Operator
Two obeys. They do not trade. They watch retail flail in and out of bad positions. They end
the day flat. No profit, but no wounds. They are alive, and survival is profit in itself.

Operator Three looks at the same numbers. The Index says one thing, their Conviction says
another. They feel bearish even though the Index shows bullish strength. They ignore the
Ledger. They short. The market rips the other way. They double down, hoping it turns. By the
close, they are bled out. They did not lose to the market. They lost to themselves. They lost
because they betrayed the Ledger.

This is the split. Operators who respect the Ledger follow its commands. They are not always rewarded, but they are never destroyed. 

Operators who betray it get harvested. They either die fast, blowing up when they press against strength, or they die slow, bled out by a

consequence. You take your Edge Index and you take your Conviction, and you cross them.
The outcome is not a feeling. It is an instruction.

The Edge Index is the score. It tells you how strong the market is trending, how momentum
is building, how volatility is shifting. The Conviction is the direction. It is the side of the trade you are prepared to press. Alone, each one is incomplete. Together, inside the Ledger, they turn into a playbook.

Imagine it as a grid. On one side runs your Index, from weak to strong. On the other runs
your Conviction, from bearish to bullish. Where they intersect, the Ledger gives you a
command. A strong Index with high bullish Conviction means you press long. A fading Index with bearish Conviction means you position short. A tangled Index with no clear read means you do not trade.

This is where most retail falls apart. They score the market one way, then trade in the
opposite direction because of news or a headline. They feel bearish while their own chart screams bullish. They override themselves and hand their money to the machine. The Ledger prevents that betrayal. It locks you into the truth of your own system.

The Ledger also defines size. When the Index is at full strength and Conviction is aligned,
the Ledger authorizes you to press harder. When strength fades, it cuts your risk. No
emotion, no guess. Your allocation comes from the book, not from fear or greed.

There is no mystery here. It is just structure. But that structure is what keeps you from turning into another casualty. Without it you are gambling in the dark. With it you are running plays that are bigger than any one trade.

The Ledger is not a journal you write in once a week. It is alive. It is your daily script. You
wake up, you score the Index, you note your Conviction, and the Ledger tells you where you
stand. In the fight. On the bench. Or waiting in the shadows for the next opening.

This is how you stop trading vibes and start trading rules. The Ledger is not optional. It is

not your broker’s balance sheet. The Ledger is the framework where survival gets written in
blood and profit.

Every Operator who lasts has one, whether they admit it or not. The suits hide theirs inside
risk departments and quant code. In the underground, you strip it down to what matters. The Ledger takes your Edge Index, the cold numbers of trend, momentum, and volatility. Then it fuses that with your Conviction, your bias, your direction of attack. 

The result is a record that dictates action.

The Ledger is not about predicting the future. You do not need the future. You need rules.
Rules that tell you when to strike. Rules that tell you when to scale. Rules that tell you when
to hedge and when to sit on your hands. You feed your Index and your Conviction into the
Ledger and it spits out the play. No guesswork. No guru hype. No gambler’s hunch.

them. They jump from one hot take to another and wonder why they bleed out. The Ledger

1nxq8lw,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 06:16:33,The Hooligan Playbook Chapter 2.4,"Conviction and Bias

The Edge Index gives you a number. Conviction gives that number teeth.

Conviction is not a hunch. Conviction is a weighted stance, born out of structure. Bullish
conviction, bearish conviction, or neutral. The Edge Index tells you if the market has
conditions worth trading. Conviction tells you which side of the street you want to be on.
Most traders confuse conviction with ego. They feel bullish, so they load up calls. They feel
bearish, so they smash puts. That is not conviction. That is gambling in costume. 

Conviction without framework is suicide. Framework without conviction is paralysis. You need both.

Conviction controls bias. Bias controls sizing. If your Index is strong and your conviction
aligns, you press. If your Index is weak but conviction is clear, you probe small. If conviction is foggy, you pull size down to nothing.

Think of it as a hierarchy. The Edge Index measures conditions. Conviction defines the bias. Bias drives action and sizing.
A strong Edge Index plus strong conviction equals large exposure. A weak Index plus strong conviction equals a test shot. A weak Index plus no conviction means you sit on your hands.

This is how you move from surviving to compounding. The Gambler bets big with no
framework. The Drifter hesitates with no bias. The Operator measures the Index, defines the
conviction, and then executes according to the bias.

Conviction is not about being right on every trade. Conviction is about being aligned with the structure. If the Index shows bullish strength and the conviction is bullish, then every dollar you risk is aligned with probability. If the Index is neutral, forcing conviction is suicide.

The blood machine feasts on traders who cannot define their bias. They flip long, then short, then flat, chasing every move. Every flip costs spread, slippage, and mental energy. The
Operator does not chase. The Operator defines bias. Then the Operator acts.

Conviction is the engine. Bias is the direction. The Index is the map. Together they turn
survival into strategy.

Conviction is not theory. It shows up in the account balance.

Take two Operators, both trading with an Edge Index score of +3. Conditions are strong.
Both see the same breakout. Both have the same tools. The only difference is how they act
on conviction. Operator A trusts the Index and aligns his conviction with it. He sizes into the trade with 1 percent of capital. His bias is clear, bullish. When the move extends, he scales once more.

The trade returns 3R. His 1 percent risk turns into a 3 percent gain. One trade pushes his
month into profit.

Operator B hesitates. The Index says strong, but his conviction is cloudy. He has been
burned before. He sizes tiny, risking 0.25 percent. He exits too early, scalping crumbs. 

The same move that gave Operator A 3 percent leaves Operator B with 0.3 percent. Safe, but
insignificant.

Now flip the coin. The next setup fails. Operator A takes a full 1 percent loss. Operator B loses only 0.25 percent. Both are still in the game. But the difference is in compounding. 

One conviction-driven win erases several losses. Hesitant wins never stack.
Conviction is not about always being right. Conviction is about pressing when the structure says press, and protecting when the structure says protect. It is how you escape mediocrity.

Barber and Odean’s research proved that overconfidence destroys traders. But lack of
conviction is just as deadly in a quieter way. Without conviction, every win is a fraction of
what it could be. Without conviction, the account flatlines.

The Gambler explodes because his conviction is blind. The Drifter starves because his
conviction is absent. The Operator compounds because his conviction is aligned with the
Index.

The blood machine does not care which path you choose. It bleeds the Gambler fast. It
bleeds the Drifter slow. Conviction is the only way out.

1nxpdmt,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 05:22:13,Why most beginners fail in the stock market and how I trained myself to avoid it,"I still remember the night I bought my first single share of Apple. It felt like holding a golden ticket. At the same time, I was terrified because I had no idea what I was actually doing. That’s when I promised myself I wouldn’t just gamble. I’d learn the basics the right way. And I’d read the right books to equip myself in the stock market.

The first thing I realized is that a stock isn’t just a lottery ticket, it’s actual ownership of a company. That shift in perspective hit me when I read Burton Malkiel’s A Random Walk Down Wall Street. He explains that when you buy one share of Coca-Cola, you literally own a slice of the business. It’s not abstract anymore. From there, I learned the two ways you earn: price growth and dividends. I know it sounds simple, but when I looked at my first dividend check (tiny as it was), I felt the connection between patience, ownership, and reward.   

But the biggest lesson wasn’t technical, it was psychological. Behavioral finance research from Barber and Odean showed how most traders actually lose money because they can’t control their impulses. I saw myself in their findings. I wanted to “do something” every hour. That’s when I picked up Mark Douglas’s Trading in the Zone, which drilled into me that trading is allprobabilities, not certainties. That one idea saved me from so many reckless trades.

My first week of notes looked like chaos. Terms like bull market, bear market, P/E ratio, stop-loss, they all felt overwhelming. But I noticed a strange pattern. Every night, when I read even just 20 minutes on stock trading, the fog started to clear. Reading is like weightlifting for your brain, it doesn’t feel like much at the moment, but over months you get sharper. I swear my decision making at work improved too.

Some resources truly carried me. Ross Cameron’s YouTube channel made trading feel less intimidated. His story of starting with $583 and pushing it into millions made me believe consistency beats luck. Then there was the podcast Masters in Business by Barry Ritholtz, where guests like Terrance Odean explained why we sabotage our own trades. These weren’t motivational fluff, they were direct mirrors to my own mistakes.

A friend then introduced me to a new AI-powered app called BeFreed, built by a Columbia University team. It felt like the learning companion I always wished existed. I barely have time to finish thick finance books during the week, but this app takes books, research, expert talks, and even podcasts and turns them into personalized audio lessons. You can pick if you want a 10-minute summary or a 40-minute deep dive. I even chose a “professor” host voice as my stock mentor, which weirdly makes me look forward to listening. What I love the most is how it adapts, the more I listen, the more it learns my style and builds me a personal study roadmap. I’ve already finished more material in two weeks than I did in months of “someday reading.” It’s helping me build a daily reading habit I thought I’d lost.

Other gems I leaned on: Jack Schwager’s Market Wizards (this book will make you question everything you think you know about trading. Insanely good read), and Nick McCullum’s YouTube course on Python for quantitative trading (I finally understood what algorithmic trading means). Each one stretched my brain in a different way, but all reinforced the same truth: daily learning compounds just like money.

I started this journey because I wanted to make smart investments. What I didn’t expect was how much the act of daily reading itself would reshape me. The more I read, the calmer my mind feels, the less I chase noise, and the more I trust the slow compounding of both knowledge and wealth. Knowledge is leverage. It’s the one thing that pays you interest for life.

Most traders mistake a signal for an edge. They see a pattern. They see a moving average
crossover. They convince themselves that is the edge. It is not. A single signal is not an
edge. You only have edge when you measure it inside a framework.

The Edge Index does that job. It tells you when the market is giving you conditions to press
and when the market is telling you to protect. It keeps you out of low quality battles. It keeps
you from guessing.

Institutions run systems like this all day. They track momentum. They track trend alignment.
They track breadth. They track order flow. They roll the inputs into a score so emotion does
not get a vote. Strong score means increase exposure. Weak score means reduce exposure.
Simple. Repeatable. Real.

Your job is not to copy someone else’s math. Your job is to build your own Edge Index. The
framework scales with the operator. Some keep it lean. Some add layers. Some build a full
spectrum model that watches everything. The principle never changes. Turn chaos into a
number. Then obey the number.

Example One: 3 inputs for a simple operator: Trend alignment, Momentum, Market breadth.
Max score plus 3. Min score minus 3. Fast and clean.

Example Two: 5 inputs for an intermediate operator: Trend alignment, Momentum, Market
breadth, Correlation check, Liquidity check. Max score plus 5. Min score minus 5. More
nuance, better for swing trades.

Example Three: 10 inputs for an advanced operator: Trend alignment across multiple time
frames, Momentum blend, Market breadth, Correlation check, Liquidity check, Earnings
trend, Interest rates, Sector relative strength, News flow alignment, Volatility regime. Max
score plus 10. Min score minus 10. Full spectrum. More work. Less noise.

These are examples. Your Edge Index does not have to be 3 or 5 or 10 inputs. It can be
whatever fits your style and your process. What matters is consistency and objectivity.

Here is the rule. Use at least 3 independent metrics to support what you believe the trend is doing. One metric can trick you. Two metrics can argue with each other. Three or more force
confirmation. They keep you honest.

When you find something you believe in — get obsessed.
If you’re trading, live and breathe it. Study the charts like your life depends on it. Journal every single trade. Analyze every move.

And listen up — stop hopping between strategies.
That’s where most beginners fail. They chase shortcuts, copy others, and wonder why they’re stuck. That’s not how you win.
Build your own strategy. Use the fundamentals, use basic SMC concepts, and refine it until it’s yours. That’s how you stand out.

Most people treat trading like a side hustle. That’s why they stay average.
If you actually want to quit your 9-5 and live free — you’ve gotta treat this like a profession. Like a mission. Like your only way out.

Trading is just a skill — and once you master it, you’re set for life.
But mastery doesn’t come from talent. It comes from obsession, discipline, and hours alone when nobody’s watching.

So stop talking. Stop making excuses.
Work harder. Study longer. Get obsessed.
That’s how you change your life.

I’m out — hope this hits the younger generation.

In the early days, my “strategy” was mostly watching influencers on YouTube or skimming quick tips on Twitter, thinking I could piece it together. I’d burn hours staring at charts, jumping between indicators, following news cycles, and second-guessing every move. The wins felt random, and the losses were discouraging. I was in a constant loop of doubt. None of what I was doing felt sustainable, and after a few all-nighters and poorly-timed trades, I hit serious burnout. It wasn’t just about losing money; it was the confusion and anxiety of not truly understanding what I was doing or why.  
  
What pushed me to keep going wasn’t the hope of some “big win,” but the need for a real process, a way to learn in the open, admit when I was lost, and actually connect with others who’d been through the same. I started to notice that there’s a huge difference between chasing signals and genuinely building a toolbox you trust. Too much of trading content out there feels like highlights without the hard parts, and that lack of transparency can make the confusion and burnout worse.

I’m wondering how many here have felt that same burnout, the analysis paralysis, or just not knowing who or what to rely on as you start.

1nxmcfl,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 02:12:23,I Journaled Every Single Trade for 1 Year… Here’s What I Found,"After a full year of journaling every single trade, here’s what the data showed me:



https://preview.redd.it/9lvk9lp4e1tf1.png?width=1755&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a35a21423b7a80176d8d5f079a30bb674679c61

Win rate: 39%



Average R: 2.42R



Net P/L: $30,847



Largest win: $3,050



Largest loss: -$1,137



The equity curve wasn’t perfect, but the growth was steady and “linear-ish.” It wasn’t luck, it was data + discipline.



Here are 5 things journaling taught me:



1. You don’t need a high win rate, risk/reward does the heavy lifting.

For most of the year my win rate sat below 40%. If I judged my trading on win % alone, I would’ve quit months ago. But journaling proved the math: with a 2.42R average, my winners more than covered my losers. It only takes a handful of clean setups executed with size to make a month profitable, even if most trades are small scratches or losers. Now also introducing a new ORB setup too which is around 45% winrate and 2R fixed so it should be interesting



2. Losing streaks are predictable and survivable if you know your edge.

When you track every trade, you can see exactly how long your average red streak lasts. For me, the data showed clusters of 4-6 losing trades in a row were normal. Once I understood that, I stopped spiraling emotionally after 3 losses and could calmly stick to the plan. Journaling turns drawdowns from something emotional into something measurable.



3. Certain times of year/sessions perform better, market cycles matter.

Over hundreds of trades, it became clear that not all market environments are equal. Summer chop dragged down my expectancy, while fall/winter trends lifted it back up. Even within the day, certain hours consistently underperformed. Knowing this helps me conserve energy and avoid forcing trades in low-probability cycles.



4. Tracking expectancy gives confidence when P/L fluctuates.

My expectancy averaged $77.9 per trade. That number became a compass. On days or even weeks where I was red, I could zoom out and know that if I just executed another 100 trades with discipline, the expectancy would play out. Without journaling, it’s too easy to let short-term noise make you abandon a strategy that’s statistically sound. Changed through bearish and bullish cycles also can be supoer scray.



5. The numbers don’t lie. Emotions do.

Before journaling, I always “felt” like I was better or worse than I actually was. Reviewing the data crushed those illusions. Trades I thought were my best setups actually had negative expectancy. Patterns I ignored ended up being my most profitable. The journal doesn’t care about feelings, it’s a mirror of your edge in cold, hard numbers.



https://preview.redd.it/v2cato5be1tf1.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=93856892f2e8709af54259384d6783eb55d1b72b

Journaling exposes your blind spots. I know which trades to size into, which to cut, and how long I can expect drawdowns to last. That’s how you survive this game long enough to let compounding do its work.



So my question to you is, do you know your results this clearly? Do you know what to expect in your market cycles?

excitement, or your fear. Feelings are what the blood machine feeds on. That is how the
Street pulls money out of retail pockets every single day.

The only thing that cuts through that noise is a framework.

A framework is not a hot tip. It is not a guru’s signal service. It is not a gut feeling. A
framework is structure. A framework is armor. It is how you survive long enough to let your
edge play out.

Think about a casino. The house edge can be 2 percent or 3 percent. That looks tiny. But
over thousands of spins and hands, that small edge becomes a guaranteed profit. Players
walk in with feelings. Excitement. Greed. Tilt. The house sits back with math. You already
know who wins.

Trading is no different. Real money runs on frameworks. Funds measure conviction. Funds
measure risk. Funds execute according to systems. Any single trade can lose. Across
hundreds of trades, a real edge with a real framework keeps them alive and profitable.
Retail loses because retail has no framework. The Gambler thinks aggression will save him.
The Drifter thinks following the crowd will save him. Both are food for the machine.

The Operator is different. The Operator runs the Framework. He measures edge with the
index. He sizes according to conviction. He balances his trades with the matrix. He does not care about the outcome of one trade because survival is not built on one trade. 

Survival is built on hundreds.

1nxl8v8,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 01:07:44,The Hooligan Playbook Chapter 1.3,"The numbers are merciless. They cut through the noise and strip away every illusion. They prove what the circus hides and what the trap denies: retail loses, over and over again. In the United States, Barber and Odean (2000) analyzed 66,465 brokerage accounts over a six-year span. They found that the average individual investor underperformed the market by 6.5 percent per year.

The most active traders, the ones convinced they were in control, performed the worst. The more they traded, the more they bled. Across the ocean, Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean (2009) studied day traders in Taiwan. This was no small sample, it included every trade placed by every investor in the market. The results were brutal. The average day trader lost 3.8 percent annually, and only one percent of traders consistently beat the market after costs. The other 99 percent were food for the machine.

In Brazil, the securities regulator CVM tracked 20,000 day traders from 2013 to 2015. After one year, 97 percent had lost money. After two years, nearly 100 percent were gone. The conclusion was unavoidable: day trading for the majority was not a path to survival, it was a conveyor belt into bankruptcy.

The Bank for International Settlements (2019) found the same pattern in forex markets. Over 80 percent of retail accounts lost money within a year. In Europe, regulators now require brokers to publish the percentage of clients who lose. The average disclosure reads the same: 70 to 80 percent lose money.

These numbers span markets, countries, and decades. They are not anomalies. They are the rule. The circus keeps the lights on by selling dreams. The trap keeps traders busy by feeding them leverage and dopamine. But the numbers do not care about illusions. They show what survival really looks like.

And the truth is this: without a framework, you die. Without a system, you bleed. Without discipline, you feed the blood machine. The numbers are the reminder that the market is not fair, not forgiving, and not fooled by hope. They are the scoreboard.

That if you trade longer, harder, with more screens and more alerts, you will beat the Street. The trap flatters your ego, telling you that you are special, that you can
outwork algorithms and institutions armed with billions.

But the trap is not built on work. It is built on design. Platforms are engineered like casinos.
Every scroll, every push notification, every glowing green candle is meant to trigger
dopamine. MIT researchers studying online brokerage accounts found that traders placed
more orders after receiving positive feedback from past gains, even if those gains were
random. This is not skill. This is conditioning. The trap keeps you clicking, because clicks are
blood flow.

Leverage is the trap’s favorite weapon. Retail is handed twenty-to-one, fifty-to-one, or in
options, nearly infinite leverage. The lure of outsized gains blinds traders to the certainty of
outsized losses. The Bank for International Settlements (2019) showed that more than 80
percent of retail forex traders lost money within a year, largely due to leverage misuse. The
trap gives you chips, but the table is tilted.
The trap convinces you that education is enough. Gurus tell you if you just memorize
patterns, you will win. Yet academic research proves otherwise. Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean
(2009) showed that even experienced day traders in Taiwan underperformed after costs.
Knowledge without framework is not an edge. It is just another illusion in the tent.

The trap feeds on overtrading. In a study of 66,000 U.S. households with brokerage
accounts, Barber and Odean (2000) found that the most active traders underperformed the
market by more than 6 percent annually. The trap wants you busy. The busier you are, the
more it eats.

The truth is brutal. The Street does not want you profitable. It wants you active. The trap wins when you trade because you feel like you must, not because your framework says the
conditions are right.

Survival requires breaking the trap. That means fewer trades, not more. Patience, not action.
Waiting until the framework says the conditions align. The Operator knows the trap is
everywhere , in dopamine, in leverage, in overconfidence, and the Operator steps
around it.

you cannot survive it.",4,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nxhd0m/the_hooligan_playbook_chapter_12/,new,Discussion,0.7

is a ringmaster, every platform a carnival tent. They promise secrets, they sell shortcuts, they
package hope as if it were strategy. The crowd gathers, the retail traders pile in, and the
show begins. But retail is not in the seats. Retail is on the stage. They are the clowns, the
animals, the ones being bled to keep the performance running.

The circus thrives on illusion. It convinces traders that excitement equals opportunity. That
the louder the commentary, the sharper the edge. CNBC yells. YouTube streams pump.
Twitter floods with hot takes and chart screenshots. Noise drowns out silence, and silence is
where the edge would actually live. Retail is addicted to the spectacle. Without the show, the
audience would realize there is no magic, only math.

The gurus play their parts well. They flash cars, rented houses, and screenshots of
cherry-picked wins. A 2022 survey by MagnifyMoney found that 58 percent of young
investors said they got trading advice from social media, not from institutions or financial
professionals. The circus works because the crowd trusts the ringmasters. And the
ringmasters keep them dancing long enough to bleed them out.

It is not just social media. Brokers dress up trading platforms with fireworks. When
Robinhood was dragged into congressional hearings after the GameStop saga, they
admitted that confetti and digital celebrations were built into the app to encourage more
trades. This was not education. It was performance. The circus needed volume. The circus
needed blood.

The suits know the show. They do not need to sit in the crowd. They run the tents. They sell
the tickets. Retail pays for entry every time they place a trade without a framework. They
walk into the circus thinking they are buying a skill. In reality, they are buying a ticket to be
devoured.

The circus never ends. When one guru burns out, another pops up. When one tent
collapses, another is pitched. And as long as traders mistake entertainment for edge, the
circus thrives.

For active traders, this setup could change how strategies are executed. It’s less about managing scattered accounts and more about reacting in real time to market conditions. That flexibility matters when volatility opens small windows of opportunity.

The bigger question is whether traders will embrace an all-in-one model like Bitget’s, or continue preferring specialized platforms for each market.

See, if I could restart, I’d focus on one style instead of bouncing between scalping, swing trading, and whatever strategy I saw online. Ive noticed that's what a lot of you guys do, and thays what I did when i was new to trading too. 

That constant switching wasted years. See, I’d build a simple, rule-based system around one setup, journal every trade, and treat it like a business from day one. Journaling felt pointless when I started, it really did... but in reality it was the only thing that forced me to see patterns in my wins and losses. On top of that, I’d make risk management non-negotiable. Back then I thought max loss rules and position sizing were things for “later,” but they’re what would have kept me from blowing up accounts and losing confidence early. Surviving year one should be the real goal, not doubling your account. Just surviving.

The other big shift would be mindset. I wasted too much time idolizing gurus and searching for a magic indicator, when in reality every trader I know who’s still around relies on discipline, execution, and patience. The edge isn’t a secret tool... it’s following your plan even when it’s boring. I also would’ve treated my capital like a startup investment, not gambling money. That means clear expectations, realistic goals, and understanding that profitability takes years, not weeks. If I had approached day one with that perspective, I’d be far ahead of where I am today.

* Revelio: +60,000
* ADP: -32,000
* Chicago Fed Unemployment: 4.3%

1nwxjru,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 08:18:51,Beginner's luck,"Many of of us noticed in others and some experienced themselves the beginner's luck. Some dilettantes have the prolonged beginners luck.

What's behind it? Just the luck? 

Imho behind this luck is an instinctive (do not confuse it with intuitive) trading.  
  
Instinctive player may know nothing of the trading theory, but he has an innate sense of where the market goes, how to run with the crowd, and not against it.  This kind of player can take huge risk ( without realizing it), and stick successfully to the positions which would long before be abandoned by any seasoned trader.  
  
But here is the problem: the day comes and the accumulated experience and wisdom of the instinctive trader overtake his instincts. Fear enters the equation, especially after some big losses. He suddenly realizes that he knows nothing, that he walks on the tightrope, that he needs knowledge, education and experience. He starts reading books, taking courses, attends forums, blogs, etc etc.. and really becomes more knowledgeable than he was before.  


The problem is with the reorientation on knowledge and experience he lost his instincts ...forever...  
  
Another problem is that the knowledge he attained is theoretical.  
  
He never actually had a working trading method before (even though he thinks he had). Now he has the trading method, but his method is a hodge-podge of ideas mixed with some feelings and is not base on found by him the objective laws of the market. One can not trade the ideas and feelings successfully, regardless of how good they are.  
  
And as the result instead of running with the crowd he now runs against it, while doing almost everything what books and courses dictate.  
  
Now he faces a monumental task - becoming a truly methodical trader.",0,7,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nwxjru/beginners_luck/,new,Discussion,0.5
1nwx1i2,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 07:55:09,Losing 5 prop firm accounts doesn’t matter if one payout covers them all,"I used to approach prop firms with a “long-term survival” mentality:

* Never fail a challenge
* Never lose an account
* Play it ultra-safe, as if I’d be trading the same funded account for years

It sounds logical, but in practice it just slowed me down and made passing challenges harder than it needed to be.

Here’s what changed everything for me: I started looking at prop firms through the **payout vs. account cost ratio**.

Think about it this way:

* If I lose 5 challenges, that’s painful, sure… but one solid payout usually covers all 5 losses.
* Once you pass, the real focus isn’t “never lose the account,” it’s **maximize the payout window**. Most firms make you wait 14 days for your first payout. That’s 14 days of trading where the goal is to secure and maximize that payout.

So now my mindset is:

* **Pass quickly** (2–4 weeks per phase is the sweet spot) with an acceptable win rate.
* **Payout focus once funded**: trade actively in that 14-day window and secure as much as possible.
* If I blow the account after securing a payout, the math still works out in my favor.

This shift helped me stop stressing about “never failing” and instead treat prop firms like what they really are: a numbers game where efficiency and payouts matter more than never losing.

That's my 2 cents when it comes to prop trading.",0,11,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nwx1i2/losing_5_prop_firm_accounts_doesnt_matter_if_one/,new,Prop firms,0.5

1nwu19z,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 05:04:43,Any full time profitable traders here? Is it worth it to keep going? I am thinking of quitting,"Hey,

I’ve been trading for about six years now. I started with a lot of learning and basic strategies, and then I got introduced to Guerrilla Trading (a former trading community from London). I learned their strategies, practiced on demo, and did a lot of backtesting.

I managed to pass the FTMO challenge, but ended up blowing the account. After that, I traded live with $1,000 and didn’t blow any live accounts—so I’d say I’ve developed discipline when it comes to managing emotions and sticking to a strategy.

Later, I developed a more aggressive short-term strategy based on the 15-minute chart. But after backtesting and live testing, I’m starting to doubt whether it’s actually profitable.

The Guerrilla Trading community turned out to be a scam and eventually shut down. That said, the strategy itself wasn’t terrible—I just haven’t been able to make it work profitably in the market conditions of the past 2–3 years. After losing a few thousand dollars on learning (losing is not the accurate word her, I learned a lot), testing, and FTMO attempts, I’m feeling pretty lost.

Right now, I’m nearing the end of university and starting to wonder: is this it for trading? Should I let go of the dream?

So I just want to ask—are there any full-time profitable traders here? Is it still worth pushing forward? I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts.If you’re a consistently profitable trader, please share your honest opinion.

There is now a very large short position against the dollar, and the dollar has reached the bottom of the long-term upward moving channel. 

The dollar will then likely rise, which can cause many of the current trade setups exploiting the downward trend of the dollar to unwind, leading to an accelerated upward movement of the dollar. This will then amplify foreign money flows into US bonds, which will further support the upward movement of the dollar.

You can only win in trading when you're thinking of probabilities of profits and losses, based on your strategy. New traders do not think of losses until they encounter one. This triggers them to reaction, which leads to revenge trading and blowing of accounts. The difference between them and experienced traders is that experienced traders know how to take losses and move on. New traders only want positive results or nothing. FYI, the market doesn't know your previous trade was a loss. So if you can take your time before getting in to the next trade, trust me you will make better decisions. Let your future wins cover the losses you've made today.

1nvhlg6,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 15:15:29,Bought at $280. RDDT down again ，Anyone Else Feeling This Pain?”？,"*Hey everyone,*

About RDDT’s price drop today, I’ve been following the news and here are some possible reasons I’ve gathered (of course I can’t be 100% sure):

\*1.\*Slowing user growth / DAU warnings. Recent reports indicate that Reddit’s daily active user growth is falling short of expectations, raising investor concerns about future traffic and user stickiness.

\*2.\*ChatGPT and AI-driven search are reducing traffic and citations from Reddit. This could mean Reddit is getting “bypassed” by AI products, weakening its platform traffic value. At the same time, Google’s AI search upgrades could be a risk for a platform like Reddit that relies heavily on search-driven traffic.

\*3.\*High valuation / overblown expectations. Reddit’s valuation was already rich, and when sentiment shifts, high-growth names often get hit first.

\*4.\*nsider selling. There have been reports of executives and founders selling shares, which can shake investor confidence. Plus, there’s skepticism about whether Reddit can really deliver on its traffic-to-revenue promises.

\*5.\*Sector pullback. Sometimes it’s not a company-specific issue but a broader risk-off move in tech/growth stocks that drags names like RDDT down.

\*6.\*Heavy volume / liquidity factors. According to Quiver Quant, today’s drop came with unusually high trading volume.

These are just the reasons I’ve been piecing together. The sad part? I bought RDDT at $280. I’m posting this to find others who might be in the same boat and hear your thoughts or strategies.

P.S. Some people say my English is bad or that I’m a bot  come on, I’m just a German guy.

Until yesterday. My rules are: a maximum of 2 trades per day, with the second one allowed only if the first is a win; a fixed 1:2 risk–reward ratio; and no staring at the charts. I created these rules because in the past I struggled with overtrading and revenge trading.

Yesterday, I broke them. My first trade (a long) was a loss—the setup wasn’t clean at all. I stayed glued to the chart (probably because I didn’t trust the setup) and got stopped out after 30 minutes. Just five minutes later, a clean setup appeared. Based on my rules, I should have already closed my computer, but instead I kept watching.

When I took the second trade right after that loss, I became emotional and moved my stop-loss (against my rules), even though I moved it into profit. Because I tightened it too much, I got stopped out—only to watch my original take-profit level eventually get hit. That made me angry, and from there I slipped back into tilt and revenge trading mode.

Simulating slippage on every execution

Including liquidity constraints (partial fills, delays)

Always accounting for broker fees/commissions


The idea would be to run the strategy on live market data (demo/forward test), but applying these additional handicaps to verify if the system remains profitable even when everything is stacked against it.

1nv4a49,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 06:12:13,What’s the hardest part of sticking to a trading strategy?,"I’ve been reflecting on the challenge of actually sticking to a trading strategy, especially in the era of endless information, charts, and “expert” opinions floating around. No matter how solid your plan is on paper, something about real-time markets or that one red candle just seems to throw everything into chaos.

Honestly, I find the hardest part isn’t designing a decent strategy, but sticking to it when emotions start kicking in. Sometimes it feels like my brain is wired to sabotage long-term plans for short-term relief. A trade moves against me, and suddenly, all the confidence in backtesting and logic flies out the window.

I’m curious, what’s the hardest part of sticking to your strategy for you? Is it discipline, fear of missing out, or second-guessing your setup? Have you discovered any techniques or mindsets that actually help you stay on track?

Here are a few things we’ve learned from funded traders who survive (and grow) vs. those who crash out early:

* Respect position sizing. If you’re risking too much per trade, you won’t survive the variance.
* Cut losers fast. Hoping for a reversal is how small losses turn into big ones.
* Daily loss limits exist for a reason. They save you from emotional spirals more than you realize.
* Revenge trading is a poison. Chasing back what you lost is usually how you lose even more.
* Zoom out. Focus on weeks/months of results, not whether *today* was green or red.

From our perspective, traders who stick around long enough to scale are the ones who treat losses as business expenses, not personal attacks.",11,2,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nv47i1/keep_these_in_mind_if_you_dont_want_to_lose_too/,new,Advice,0.92

1nuzhw3,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 01:05:15,My Opinion about Trading..change my mind,"Trading is the worst business model I have ever seen it lacks stability and consistency. I know some genius traders will try and tell me how the lack of consistency is with my style but I have mastered my style and for the most part of this year there were completely no setups, the market was very dry. Trading for me will forever remain a side hustle to get some windfall cash once in a while but it's a completely unreliable business model. You are not going to be paying your monthly recurring bills with it. The other thing is unless you are using a well trained bot to replace you, you always have to be there, if you are sick or have moods you make no money due to a high risk of human error. I think other business models are better because with those you can implement systems and AI easily that help it run around the clock. Take for example an online business where you create a website that does the selling for you. You can outsource product creation and you automate prospecting through running ads, all you have to do is manage the system and by this you are just watching out and controlling anomalies that may make the revenue go off track other than that you are free and the money is coming in as you do other stuff. Once you put in the upfront effort you can sit back and relax.  The business runs the majority of the time without you.Trading is not like that once you learn it you still need to be actively participating in it. The worst part about trading is once you have spent time honing these skills for years thinking it's going to be your way out of poverty you realize the skills you have been polishing are not transferrable to another industry, they are extremely niche. So if you are unable to become profitable you are fucked and have wasted a considerable amount of time and money learning something that is very restricted in industry application.This is why it generates alot of scammers, people start with good intentions hoping they will be rich, they realize its difficult to learn, they have spent years and money trying to master it but are still not profitable and that is when they realize this business aint it and they need to make up for all the time and money lost, so they decide to become the shovel sellers, selling shovels to the people going after the gold rush.",8,135,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nuzhw3/my_opinion_about_tradingchange_my_mind/,new,Discussion,0.61

Does the same go for Forex, Futures, and Crypto?

The market has been unbelievably resilient and it just makes me think how much longer we can sustain prices we’re at right now before a huge correction. Regardless, I’m trading my setups no matter what direction the market moves, and I’ve more confident than ever. 

Took the trade above today as well, which was a beautiful hidden bullish divergence on QQQ. This was closer to EOD, but looked too good not to take. 

As you can see we’re making higher lows in price, and the TSI below is making lower lows. This is a textbook hidden bullish divergence, AKA continuation of trend.

   1. If you fully use the 10x leverage extension, your maximum possible order value is 1,000,000 USDC.,
   2. If you fully use the 10x leverage extension, your maximum possible order value is 100,000 USDC.,
   3. This means your Account currently holds 100,000 USDC.,
   4. You will always borrow 100,000 USDC when buying BTC.
2. *\[*23:22*\]*Your last executed trade was under 10x leverage. Your current Maintenance Margin currently is USD 10,000, the current Margin Balance in your Unified Trading Account is USD 10,500. What does this mean and what should you do next?
   1. Your Maintenance Margin Rate is close to 100%. Take action to avoid liquidation by repaying borrowed crypto-assets or depositing more collateral into your Unified Trading Account.,
   2. Your Maintenance Margin Rate is below 10%. At 10x leverage, your Margin Balance is multiplied by 10, so your liquidation risk is low.,
   3. Your Maintenance Margin Rate is close to 100%. Consider reducing your leverage to lower the overall risk in your Unified Trading Account.,
   4. You're not at risk of liquidation as long as your Maintenance Margin doesn’t drop to zero.,
3. Assuming USDC has a Collateral Value Ratio of 100% and BTC has a Collateral Value Ratio of 95%. How does the Collateral Value Ratio may impact your liquidation risk?LastNewLifeBULL *—* 23:26 
   1. The Collateral Value Ratio doesn't affect your liquidation risk. It only determines the value of crypto-assets when repaying loans.,
   2. If you hold $1,000 worth of USDC, your liquidation risk is lower than if you hold the same value in BTC.,
   3. A higher Collateral Value Ratio leads to a higher liquidation risk when borrowing crypto-assets from Bybit EU.,
   4. All BTC held in your Unified Trading Account are always subject to the same Collateral Value Ratio.,
4. *\[*23:28*\]*How does 10x leverage impact your exposure to fees?
   1. You will be exposed to higher borrowing fees but your liquidation risk does not increase, as you will only pay your borrowing fees at repayment of the crypto-asset loan.,
   2. A higher leverage level will have no impact on the amount of fees paid.,
   3. Your holding duration does not negatively impact your fee exposure as borrowing fees will only be calculated at the repayment of the crypto-asset loan.,
   4. A higher leverage level generally results in a higher amount of borrowed crypto-assets. This results in higher borrowing fees and negatively impacts your liquidation risks.,
5. *\[*23:29*\]*How does increased market volatility of ETH price impact you under Cross Margin Mode, if you hold ETH in your Unified Trading Account?
   1. You will not be impacted if you only trade a BTC/USDC pair with 10x leverage.,
   2. If you only borrow USDC, ETH price volatility won't affect your liquidation risk.,
   3. A sudden drop in ETH price could reduce your Collateral and trigger liquidation.,
   4. Repaying all your ETH loans will eliminate your liquidation risk

Question 1: Imho answer 1 and 3 are correct.  
Question 2: 1 and 3 might be correct. In reality I would try to avoid liquidation cascads here, but I felt (and chat gpt agreed) they wanna hear 1 here.  
Question 3: Answer 2 has to be correct?  
Question 4: I assume I went with 4, but the FAQ might suggest 1.  
Question 5: It has to be 3?

1nuqgo1,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 17:53:49,Bringing Hedge Fund/Mid Frequency Trading to the Masses,"I have been a quant trader in high frequency trading (e.g. IMC, Optiver, Citadel, HRT, Jane) for 10+ years. I have made enough to retire comfortably but I've been ruminating quitting my job to change the finance industry. Most of the mid-frequency trading strategies (stocks, options, cryptos) have high sharpe and are not too difficult to replicate. I have talked to my friends at hedge funds, long-short equity funds and they feel similarly. However, retail investors have historically not have had access to these strategies.

The platform would serve as a bridge for talented traders and quants—whether experienced professionals or successful independent day traders—who want to run their own strategies outside of traditional institutions. Each trader would have a profile featuring their background, optional backtests, and high-level strategy information. Customers could review these profiles, allocate capital to the traders they trust, and have trades automatically executed in their IBKR accounts on a proportional basis. Traders would only see aggregated assets under management, not individual portfolios. Traders would get management fees and/or profit share but this would be much lower than traditional institutions. However, this model has its limitations including execution quality and limitations around implementing certain complex options strategies

I know currently there are copy trade platforms (e.g. eToro, Echo Trade, Autopilot etc) but they all seem a bit scammy/meme. In **Phase II**, the goal would be to evolve into a licensed custodian, enabling execution through advanced venues such as dark pools, lit markets, RFQs, and auctions. This would significantly improve execution quality for customers. Additionally, this would enable fractionalization of equities and options, allowing traders to implement more sophisticated strategies typically reserved for institutional funds. Over time, as the user base grows, we would also invest in infrastructure—such as microwave networks and colocation facilities—to compete more effectively with high-frequency trading firms. To protect investors, traders would operate under defined risk and drawdown limits, ensuring disciplined portfolio management and preventing excessive risk-taking.

Make a profitable system grounded in logic with predefined rules regarding the entry logic for every entry, risk management and trade management ahead of time; with that, you won't need to think about anything when pressing the button. Design your strategy so specifically that you have at least a good idea where your target, stop and entry are before your entry signal completes.

**It's so much easier to be disciplined if you know the exact thing you're looking for on every trading session, people underestimate this. Ditch grandiose frameworks and trade something pre-defined, repeatable and real.**

[Example Purposes Only](https://reddit.com/link/1nufjlk/video/hxevid198hsf1/player)

Example: When you don't have to think about where your target is because you know the specific rules and sequence for every possible target things become ultra-relaxed.

Before my formation is complete I know where my entry price, stop, and target are on most iterations. **That's real freedom. Zero decision fatigue.**

The only decision I leave myself with is putting that trade on.

1nu0q64,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 21:55:43,The Silent Struggle of Trading,"What most people never see about trading is the silence.



It’s the hours spent in front of a screen while the rest of the world goes on without you. It’s friends not understanding why you’d rather journal your trades than go out. It’s family asking if this is “just a phase” while you quietly build a future they can’t imagine.



That silence is heavy but it’s also where the magic happens.



In the quiet, you find focus.

In the routine, you find strength.

In the loneliness, you find yourself.



Trading isn’t about noise, it’s about peace. The freedom you’re chasing won’t come from being understoo,it comes from doing the work when no one is watching.



So if you feel distant, disconnected, even misunderstood, know this: you’re not lost. You’re just walking a road most people will never dare to step on. And if you keep going, the freedom, the success, the peace… it will all be worth it.

* The layout's super straightforward. I tried other sites before but they felt kind of overwhelming, this one just lets me focus on practising.
* I like being able to look back and see how I did over time-it makes it easier to spot when I'm falling into bad habits (like jumping into trades too fast).

Paper trading feels inefficient, mostly because most people don't use it long enough to truly test and validate their strategies. And if they would, then it would take years! And even if you did everything perfectly, then you woudn't get the emotional strength required for trading.

So at least i've hoped to solve the first part of the equation: getting data. I've also tried to gamify it by introducing ranked seasons, where every month is a new season.

# Academic and Institutional Studies & Serious Books

**This document is for anyone curious about the reasoning behind our process and thinking, or for those seeking deep trading knowledge.**

***Pause and read when something piques your interest. Judge by citation.***

**1. Random Walk & Market Efficiency**

**Eugene Fama - THE BEHAVIOR OF STOCK-MARKET PRICES**

**Key Part:**

“By contrast the theory of random walks says that the future path of the price level of a security is no more predictable than the path of a series of cumulated random numbers. In statistical terms the theory says that successive price changes are independent, identically distributed random variables. Most simply this implies that the series of price changes has no memory, that is, the past cannot be used to predict the future in any meaningful way”

**Note:**  
We are not suggesting the market is 100% efficient/random. We referenced this to show how randomness in a market isn’t good for your bottom line. The more efficient/random a market is the harder it is to trade profitably

**Eugene Fama - Random Walks in Stock Market Prices.**

**Key Takeaway:**

if the random-walk theory is an accurate description of reality, then the various “technical” or “chartist” procedures for predicting stock prices are completely without value.

 

**Burton Malkiel - A Random Walk Down Wall Street**

**Key Lines:**

“A random walk is one in which future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past history. When the term is applied to the stock market, it means that short-run changes in stock prices are unpredictable”

“Mathematicians call a sequence of numbers produced by a random process (such as those on our simulated stock chart) a random walk. The next move on the chart is completely unpredictable on the basis of what has happened before.” – **Referencing Random Candlestick Charts**

[A Random Chart](https://preview.redd.it/vub60qytg4sf1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d82d67028281adb41fc414a6e4cc7c8c85bfa2d)

[Another random chart designed to look like S&P 500 Futures \(ES\)](https://preview.redd.it/bl1fhs0wg4sf1.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=714b9c45ad9d847d4ecf8559d79ea41bb4449868)

**The core lesson of the random‐walk theory is that you cannot predict future market price movements by studying historical data if the market is 100% random.**

 

**2. Alpha/Market Edge Decay & Why no profitable trader would sell or give away their strategy for free.\[1\]**

**Julien Penasse - Understanding Alpha Decay**

 

**Highlights that alpha (edge over market) tends to diminish. alpha decay is generally a nonstationary phenomenon/inconsistent. Julien leverages studied anomalies for credibility.**

**Key Parts:** “Because alpha decay is generally a non-stationary phenomenon, asset pricing tests that impose stationarity may lead to biased inference. I illustrate the importance of alpha decay using the most commonly-studied anomalies in the asset pricing literature”

“Alpha decay refers to the reduction in abnormal expected returns (relative to an asset pricing model) in response to an anomaly becoming widely known among market participants” **\[1\]**

 

**This is popular, modern and potent evidence that alpha decay and edge decay is real.**

**Does Academic Research Destroy Stock Return Predictability? - Journal of Finance, R. David McLean**

**Published in 2016**

**Key takeaway:**

“Portfolio returns are 26% lower out-of-sample and 58% lower post-publication. The out-of-sample decline is an upper bound estimate of data mining effects. We estimate a 32% (58% - 26%) lower return from publication-informed trading.”

 

**On the Effect of Alpha Decay and Transaction Costs on the Multi-period Optimal Trading Strategy** by Chutian Ma and Paul Smith (2025):

The approach shown on this paper captures the essence of alpha decay by allowing the strength of signals to wane as they age, reflecting reality where the effectiveness of trading signals decrease over time. Re-enforcing the idea of edge / alpha decay.

Present in the ABSTRACT: **“To simulate alpha decay, we consider a case where not only the present value of a signal, but also past values, have predictive power”**

**3. Intraday Seasonality & Session‐Based Rules**

**Admati & Pfleiderer - A Theory of Intraday Patterns**

**Key Parts:**

Paper documents intraday volume & volatility U‐shape across NYSE hours.

Ex Table 1 show how volume and volatility vary through NYSE hours.

**4. Mean Reversion vs. Trending Characterization**

**Intraday mean-reversion after open shocks: Grant, Wolf, and Yu (2005) document strong reversal effects in US equity index futures**

**Key Lines:**

This paper gives a long-term assessment of intraday price reversals in the US stock index futures market following large price changes at the market open. We find highly significant intraday price reversals over a 15-year period (November 1987-September 2002) as well as significant intraday reversals in our yearly and day-of-the-week investigations. Moreover, the strength of the intraday overreaction phenomenon seems more pronounced following large positive price changes at the market open.

 That being said, the question of whether a trader can consistently profit from this information remains open as the significance of intraday price reversals is sharply reduced when gross trading results are adjusted by a bid-ask proxy for transactions costs.

 

**Rama Cont - Empirical Properties of Asset Returns**

**Key Lines:**

Table 1 lists “Volatility Clustering” and “Gain/loss asymmetry” i.e Mean reversion characteristics for major indices.

 

**5. Backtesting**

**Bailey, López de Prado & Zhu - Pseudo‐Mathematics and Financial Charlatanism**

**Key Lines**

We prove that high simulated performance is easily achievable after backtesting a relatively small number of alternative strategy configurations, a practice we denote ‘backtest overfitting

The higher the number of configurations tried, the greater is the probability that the backtest is overfit... Under memory effects, backtest overfitting leads to negative expected returns out-of-sample, rather than zero performance.

**6. Order Flow, Microstructure and how markets work**

**Albert S. Kyle - Continuous Auctions and Insider Trading**

**Key Lines for us:**

**Albert S. Kyle** “Perhaps the most interesting properties concern the liquidity characteristics of the market in a continuous auction equilibrium. ""Market liquidity"" is a slippery and elusive concept, in part because it encompasses a number of transactional properties of markets. These include ""tightness"" (the cost of turning around a position over a short period of time), ""depth"" (the size of an order flow innovation required to change prices a given amount), and ""resiliency"" (the speed with which prices recover from a random, uninformative shock). Black \[2\] describes intuitively a liquid market in the following manner: ""The market for a stock is liquid if the following conditions hold: (1) There are always bid and asked prices for the investor who wants to buy or sell small amounts of stock immediately. (2) The difference between the bid and asked prices (the spread) is always small”

Kyle breaks down what Market liquidity is and What makes a market liquid showing that imbalances between buyers and sellers i.e. imbalance in liquidity is the reason why price moves. To us this is obvious but many traders don’t consider it.

 

**Trading and Exchange: Market microstructure for practitioners - Larry Harris**

Parts 1.5, 3.10, and 3.11 were well written and more on point; Part 3.12 is an amusing read too.

It’s a lot less intense when comparing to market microstructure theory, and he uses humorous terms which keep things engaging, making it a nice gateway.

 

**Maureen O’Hara - Market Microstructure Theory**

**Key Chapters:**

Chapter 1-5 covers how liquidity and order flow mechanics underpin price formation.

**Maureen O’Hara - High Frequency Market Microstructure**

**This paper reveals how modern markets are different and contains heavy discussion of HFT involvement in modern markets.**

**Born to choose: the origins and value of the need for control**

Lauren A Leotti 1, Sheena S Iyengar, Kevin N Ochsner

The innate feeling of needing to be in control of outcome in human psychology (The root of most trading pain & desire for discretion in trading)

**Present in the ABSTRACT:**

""Belief in one's ability to exert control over the environment and to produce desired results is essential for an individual's wellbeing. It has repeatedly been argued that perception of control is not only desirable, but is also probably a psychological and biological necessity. In this article, we review the literature supporting this claim and present evidence of a biological basis for the need for control and for choice-that is, the means by which we exercise control over the environment. Converging evidence from animal research, clinical studies and neuroimaging suggests that the need for control is a biological imperative for survival, and a corticostriatal network is implicated as the neural substrate of this adaptive behavior.""

**The Role of Financial Instruments in Reducing Exchange Rate Risk Vlora Berisha, Rrustem Asllanaj**

\- For context from Ron: Total Return Swaps (TRS) and Contract for Difference (CFDs) are similar in that both allow you to gain exposure to an asset’s price changes/performance without owning it outright. You benefit from price changes and, depending on the contract & type even receive or pay income like dividends or interest. Both involve paying financing costs if you hold positions overnight (swap fees)

# Definitions written by Ali (SentientAnalyzer)

**1.Constraints**

What limits you - time, capital, lifestyle. These set the boundaries for what you can actually trade. Your system must respect them.

**2. Market Type**

Behaviour of a market: mean reverting, trending, or random/alternating.

**3. Valid Trading Window**

The hours when you’re allowed to trade. Based on where volume and volatility are, not your convenience.

**4. Risk (R)**

The set amount of capital you’re willing to lose per trade. Fixed, consistent. Example: 1R = 3%.

**5. RRR**

Risk-to-reward ratio (e.g. 1:3 = risk $100 to make $300).

**6. Order-Flow Mechanics**

Price moves because buyers and sellers are imbalanced. That’s it. It explains rejections and moves - it’s not an edge, it’s just reality.

**7. 3-Wick Setup**

Three wicks rejecting a level - signals price has repeated selling activity and won’t break through. Must be rule-based, not subjective.

**8. Tick**

The smallest price increment on an instrument.

**9. Execution**

Cost Spreads, commissions, and slippage affecting net performance. Ignore it and your edge vanishes.

**10. Backtest**

Testing your rules on past data. Done honestly - no scrolling, no cherrypicking, no hindsight. Bar Replay below in

**11. Overfitting**

When your strategy works only on the past because you’ve shaped it to work on past historical data instead of applying and idea to historical data. Looks good in testing, fails live.

**12. Stress Test**

Deliberately run your system in bad conditions. These are notable periods of intraday chop, low volume on trend trading strategies and periods of relentless trends on mean reversion/reversal strategies. If it collapses, it’s weak.

Example: Someone could be running a mean reversion day trading system on YM and he could stress test August 8th to September 13th 2024 as an example, where, here Dow Jones exhibited strong trending behaviour which is against the system’s nature.

**13. Bar Replay Play**

charts forward candle by candle to mimic real-time. Helps you test if you’d actually take your setups live. E.g., TradingView Bar Replay

**14. Scaling In**

Adding size after entry. Must be planned and tested - not just done because “it looks good”.

**15. Hedge**

Open a position benefiting from movements in the opposite direction. Useful at times, but messy if you don’t have clear rules.

**16. Breakeven/Partials**

Closing part/all of the trade early. Often reduces long-term edge unless justified by data.

**17. Ghost Liquidity**

Orders that aren’t visible but sit around visible levels. Cause sharp reactions or none at all. It’s just a surge of liquidity that isn’t visible on the books.

**18. Random Walk**

Price sometimes moves like noise. Most patterns don’t work unless they’re backed by logic. A Random Walk is a market that is 100% random. In other words, it is effectively a completely efficient market where no edge is possible. Real markets are of course different.

**19. Bracketed Limit Orders**

Pre-set entry, stop, and take-profit. Forces discipline. Removes intuition and discretion.

**20. Institutional Narrative Fallacy**

The idea that “smart money” always leaves clues. Usually marketing fluff. If it’s not testable, it’s not valid.

**21. Data Snooping**

Repeatedly looking at a data series from different angles to confirm something that you haven’t defined ahead of time often leading to insignificant and/or biased discoveries. Essentially looking too hard for patterns and finding things that don’t actually repeat. Typically kills forward performance.

**22. Drawdown**

How far your strategy drops from peaks in tests. Crucial for knowing how big your positions should be in advance. For example, a trader could have a max losing streak of 8 but your peak to trough could be 12x your risk (some wins followed by strings of losses repeatedly create this) – Super important to track and know. That’s the maximum drawdown you should be taking into account especially if working with prop firms.

**23. Dynamic Targeting**

Set targets based on real market structure - swing highs, lows, clusters of wicks. not arbitrary price movements e.g., 100 points, 100 handles, 100 pips, 100 ticks. Market is too dynamic for a one size fits all.

**24. Expectancy**

The average gain or loss per trade. Strategies don’t need high win rates - it needs consistency in the data and logical backing: Expectancy = average win × win rate − (1 − win rate) × average loss.

**25. Logic-Driven Rule** A rule built on how the market behaves - not what a shape on a chart looks like or some untested theory. For example purposes only, using the 3 wicks example. Bar 1 closes with a wick high; this shows that there was selling pressure. If the next candle interacts with bar 1’s high but fails to close above, creating another wick, it shows continued selling pressure. If on bar 3 it happens again, it shows compounded selling pressure. If it reverses, it should do so quickly. If price continues beyond the wicks, price should continue trending. Using a small stop loss relative to the target can create an edge if costs are managed properly.

**Daily Chart (D1)**

We continue to maintain the bullish projection of the triangle, with a target toward the **3860 USD** level.

The bullish intent remains valid, although it is beginning to show signs of weakening.

We detect a **bearish divergence** between the price and our **SmartMass** indicator, which indicates that the upward momentum is weakening and could anticipate a correction or consolidation before resuming its upward drive.

The key support to watch is around the **3700–3720 USD** zone, coinciding with previous price reaction levels and technical projections.

**4H Chart (H4)**

The price has reached a very high momentum, moving significantly away from the main trend.

The upward movement is approaching a **parabolic move**, which is usually associated with impulsive climax phases.

The **SmartMass** indicator confirms this reading, showing signs of excessive momentum and suggesting that a **two-leg correction** is likely to test the main trend line.

Currently, the price has formed a **final flag pattern (FF ch)** of a channel type, which could anticipate the start of a significant correction within the overall trend.

**Technical projection:** the first corrective leg could take the price toward the approximate level of **3707 USD**, corresponding to the end of the second leg (**LEG2**).

If you’ve tried either (or both), I’d love to hear your experience and advice!

1nsve7m,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 14:16:19,"Do you prefer trading short setups into weakness, or momentum setups into strength?","I’ve been testing and running futures strategies that basically boil down to two camps:
	1.	Short setups into weakness – fading failed pushes when the market shows cracks.
	2.	Momentum setups into strength – stacking into directional moves once the market confirms trend and velocity.

Both work if managed right, but the psychology is totally different:
	•	Short setups feel great when you nail the turn, but they punish you hard if you’re early.
	•	Momentum setups feel “safer” following strength, but they can chop you up if trend stalls.

Do you lean toward shorting weakness or pressing momentum, and why?

1nspxmr,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 10:36:53,Market Conditions and Sector Strategy," The 1990s Market Environment 

In the 1990s, the U.S. stock market experienced a period of rapid and extraordinary growth, largely fueled by the dot-com boom. Technology stocks surged as investors poured money into internet-based companies, many of which had little to no earnings. During this period, annual returns averaged an astonishing 16.1%, nearly double the historical average. This unrestrained optimism eventually created the dot-com bubble, which burst in the early 2000s, leading to a sharp decline in valuations and painful lessons for many investors. 

Today’s Market Conditions In contrast, today’s market is more balanced, though not without challenges. The S\&P; 500 is showing modest growth, reflecting investor optimism, but several headwinds exist. Persistent inflation and the introduction of new tariffs add uncertainty, reminding traders to approach the market strategically. Analysts see some similarities to the 1990s in the form of high enthusiasm for technology-driven growth. However, the modern market benefits from a more informed investor base and stronger regulatory oversight. Today’s optimism is backed by tangible advancements in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and electric vehicles—sectors with clear long-term potential, unlike many of the speculative dot-com startups of the past. 

The Role of Sector Rotation Sector rotation continues to be a critical strategy for traders and investors. During expansion phases of the economy, cyclical sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary, and industrials often outperform. On the other hand, when markets weaken or uncertainty rises, defensive sectors like healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities tend to provide stability. Understanding these cycles allows traders to anticipate shifts and position their portfolios accordingly, capturing opportunities while managing risk. 

Swing Trading and Sector Awareness For swing traders, combining sector rotation principles with short-to-medium-term positions can be especially effective. Swing traders can use sector ETFs to gain broad exposure, while also selecting individual stocks that align with the prevailing sector trend. Reviewing sector performance weekly and making timely adjustments helps traders remain in sync with the market’s rhythm. This blend of strategy adds both flexibility and diversification to a swing trading approach. 

Conclusion 

While today’s market offers growth opportunities, it also carries risks that demand careful attention. Unlike the unchecked exuberance of the 1990s, the current environment is a mix of optimism and caution. By staying adaptable, focusing on sectors aligned with the economic cycle, and blending broader awareness with specific trades, investors and traders can position themselves for success in a complex and evolving market.",1,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nspxmr/market_conditions_and_sector_strategy/,new,Technical analysis,1.0

1nsndb0,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 08:41:53,Probability/Statistics guidance needed for warrant trading with rollovers and no Stop-Loss,"Hello,

I have been trading for 3 years, focused on index warrants, and I want to get serious about quantifying risk, drawdowns, and position sizing using probability and statistics.

Here’s my setup:

* \~300 trades/year
* I don’t use stop losses. Losing positions are held until reversal, historically \~14 days on average. I roll over warrants with a 9–12 month expiration window
* I trade both directions (calls and puts)
* Occasionally, extreme trades happen: \~2 per year were historically “unrecoverable.” I either offset them gradually with profits or, if critical, cut them and move on.
* I currently use fractional Kelly (\~1/6) for position sizing.

My goals:

1. Estimate the tail risk of ruin and portfolio survival over multiple years, accounting for different trade counts.
2. Optimize position sizing / Kelly fraction considering the above risk calculations.

I have intermediate Python skills. I’m looking for practical guidance on where to start and focus, which methods/theories are directly applied to this case.

Appreciate any help/resource/2cent.

1ns94pi,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 19:10:50,2 years in and I'm losing myself.,"To give a bit of context, I started trading when I was 15, after countless trials and errors with multiple so-called ""ways to get rich"" you'd find on social media. It struck me instantly when I started learning about it and it grew a part of me which I didn't know I had; I truly enjoyed the dirty work, my mind shifted towards the mindset of ""work hard now, be free later"". And I loved it. When I woke up in the morning I had that burning fire in me, comparable to the feeling you get the day you'd take the plane going on vacation.

I was learning quick and worked towards surrounding myself with likeminded people online since none of my friends were willing to take the leap. As you'd expect the first year, I didn't achieve mind blowing results, though I made profits the year being 2024 meaning it was green everywhere for crypto (I mainly trade BTC). My dad supported me from the start, always being there to hear about my breakthroughs, struggles and growth; Or so I thought. He started off small asking about my profits and how it was going. But I had hit a threshold after the bull run turned into a sideways market so I didn't have much to show. I was effectively going sideways with the market for a couple of months. That's when I learnt my dad actually thought trading didn't work: ”I don’t believe it works” - “Focus on your studies it’s more important than this crap you’re doing” - “You’re better off investing your time in something valuable for your studies” were his words. All of a sudden the only person I confided to and thought would always support me was gone. This was in June of 2024 and ever since that day, my life has been going downhill. Not too long after that I lost contact with most of my trading connections due to them graduating high-school and moving on from trading.

To talk a bit more about my trading style which is important to the story, I usually take 1to 5 trades a week solely depending on the market conditions. 
I consider my strategy to be the ""rare occurrence high win rate"" type. I find it complicated back-testing it as it's not an easy enough concept that I can code to test on previous markets or find myself in a short amount of time (30-45min per trade). On a small sample of 17 of  trades ranging from 2.5RR to 5RR, I made money on 65% of them, 47% hit full TP and only 29% lost me money. Now I know this might be just luck, but keep in mind those were live trades, following my perfected plan which I found not too long ago (November 2024 - February 2025 is the timeline for the testing).
So there I was, all alone with just my will to keep going. I somehow managed to last the whole winter locked in on my goals. The end of the school year was approaching and my dad had to add on my struggle, giving me ""The father’s speech"" as a lot may have already experienced it. This time I understood by his tone he wasn't joking around anymore. He pressured me to let go of trading and focus on my exams coming up in a couple of months. For the next couple of months, every time I opened up, my parents’ eyes fell on my hard work with contempt, crushing the pride I had felt only moments before.

I'm closing in on my last season to prove them wrong before I graduate. I don't feel anything anymore when I open the charts even though I have tradingview set as a startup app; I just close the window immediately. I would do anything to go back to how it was. I don't know what I'm looking for by typing this out but I would say this is bringing me one step closer to making it out of this hole.

1ns0d47,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 13:01:54,You lose because you don’t understand averaging down,"Somewhere some guru heard a hedge fund guy talk about averaging down. And then the guru took that gambling mentality and sold it as a strategy. Most of the time it works.

Listen carefully.

Most of the time it works.

That’s the trap. 

When it doesn’t. Game over.

You’ve been doing it wrong. Again. Stop it. Pay attention. And learn how to stop losing. 

If I average down, I’m usually spot trading. I don’t do this for options as that’s already set for optimal convexity. 

Your SL should be away from the violence. I mean way away. Like whatever you think is away, more away. 

Your SL is in the back with the binoculars watching the fight carefully. That’s where your max loss is. 

Again. Max loss. So if that’s 1% that would be there. A huge ass swing in the wrong direction and then it takes you out at one percent.

Now, when you enter, don’t enter in your full position. Wait. If it goes on, fine let it. You can scale in later. 

But now, if it pulls back. Get in again. Now what you’re doing is sort of averaging your midpoint of the trade. You’re getting a better entry and if price keeps going the wrong way, you’re risking less than your full 1%. 

Then when you get the confirmation going back in your direction, enter again, and when it breaks the high or low, enter one more. 

Congratulations, you now know how average down and to scale into any one of your stupid strategies to give you a better chance at obtaining an edge. 

Your guru is lying to you. Stop listening to them. They don’t know what they are talking about. You just don’t know enough to know how stupid they all sound.

1nri4d0,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 21:00:28,Winrate and ROI are meaningless,"Only fake gurus brag about it.

Capitalizing on edges when they present themselves is all about management of risk.

Whats wiser?

Risking 80% of your cash to make 30% 

Risking 20% of your cash to make 20%

Or risking 5% of your cash to make 10%.

Most people fall for the trap of thinking winrate and ROI mean something when they don’t. It’s how people sign up for services and suddenly they start to lose money. Or follow gurus who suddenly start to fall.

People do not know how to analyze risk.

So let’s look at some numbers.

Here are some stats from one of the funds I transparently show to the public.

Correlation to S&P - .511
Sharpe Ratio - 1.37
Sortino Ratio - 1.88
Beta - .46 
Alpha - .06

Lets breakdown what this shit means. I move with the market half the time. Depending who you ask that’s either a good or bad thing. 

Sharpe is a measurement of return for the risk deployed. Excellent would be 1.5. Mine sits pretty. Not the best. But it indicates I’m a decent performer. 

Sortino measures downside volatility. How effective one is when the market turns against the portfolio. 1.88 is fucking baller. My largest drawdown this year lasted for five days during the tariff shock in April. And even then it was just a theoretical loss as it stemmed from the extrinsic value skyrocketing during that time. Ended the month in profit. My lowest month this year was a loss of .1%. This is where I shine.

Beta measures my volatility against the stock market. Default is 1. Over 1 and you have wilder swings than the market. Lower than one means your less volatile then the market. Low beta could imply lower returns and high beta could imply higher risks. I’m consistently less volatile than the market as I prefer scalable and predictable outcomes.

Alpha measures how much better you’re expected to perform beyond the market given the risk deployed. I’m expected to beat expected performance given the risk by 6%. This implies my edge is institutional grade.

So when you summate it all it implies that my results will likely outperform the market on half the volatility that the market would provide with limited downside risk. 

I am over 20% for the year cumulatively and I’m currently compounding over 50% annual returns.  

Now… ROI has some meaning when you see the entire picture.

My winrate is 54.8% solely because I hedge and trade a lot of spreads. Because of the complexity of my trading it would be foolish to even consider winrate as a feature to brag about. When I’m trimming any spread almost always I’m cutting a loss and a winner at the same time. Generally the winner being more than the loser.

So when the guru starts bragging about his 90% winrate and 200% ROI, go look at the ridiculous risks it took to get there and see how it isn’t sustainable when you learn how to read and understand risk.

Demand transparency from anyone offering you any advice even if it’s free.

1nrg244,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 19:20:35,The sheer reality of gurus.,"In the business of finance, when you have an edge you want to leverage that edge. Meaning, for the same work that you do you want to keep doing that same work and you’ll exponentially grow. 

When you have an edge, it’s literally just a money printer at that point that can only end up printing more money. Nobody is going to sell that or give it away when you can profit immensely off of it.

Edges aren’t infinite. They are finite.

The market is ridiculously efficient. So efficient that you could think you have an edge for years just for the market to rip it away because of unforeseen risks you have no concept to mitigate. 

So, how gurus even come to be is that like you, they tried something. But they caught a winning variance. Like you, they want to show that off and be the next big top guru. They force themselves to take bigger risks or the already big risks they take get negated by the efficient frontier. 

They need money. They want the lifestyle. So they turn to sell the system that they used and got lucky on. They’ll only show you want they want to show you.

They’ll tell you that you have to learn for yourself. They’ll even tell you that signal services are garbage. 

And that’s true too. Most are trash. Nearly all our trash. Wait until my competing funds realize the AI bots they are implementing don’t work for shit when the market flips. Ya boy is gonna 10x again. 

These lying gurus have created an environment of bs on what it required to be profitable. You know this. You truly do. You’re not stupid. Well… the gamblers are. They’ll chase that dopamine to the ends of the earth. Thank god for them. Without stupid traders, winners wouldn’t have anyone to profit from. 

But to do what you’re attempting is lunacy. Maybe you can get there. Doubt it. 

But not the way you’re going about it. Your guru lied to you.

Stop blaming yourself for not getting it and start blaming the phonies who are lying to you. 

Rebel against it. Demand absolute proof. Not just of gurus. Of anyone giving you advice on trading.

Everyone wants to feel like the teacher when they should shut up and focus on being worthy to begin with. And in this game, trading.

It comes down to one thing and one thing only.

Shares are up 46.2% year-to-date, outperforming peers, though valuation now trades at a forward P/E of 38.4x. Despite momentum, investors face a reminder: VMware recently agreed to a [$102.5M securities settlement](https://11th.com/cases/vmware-investor-settlement), underscoring lingering governance concerns.

* Gross margin expanded 300 bps to 93% post-VMware integration.
* Operating margin surged to 77%, reflecting scale efficiencies.

Developments in AI are no joke in terms of a huge step towards leveling the playing field, and I believe every trader will have an AI assistant suggesting, a finance support chat bot on brokerages at the very least, which will then evolve in the very near future.  
  
I think my main goal here is to provide some context. I am not alone in this endeavor, and am working with two AI/ML data scientists/senior engineers. I used to work for a hedge fund, and the three of us all worked together at an AI startup where we realized that what we, and a ton of other 'AI startups' were doing wasn't even really using/a good use case for AI. Bubble material, fs. Them, having been interested in algorithmic trading/me having worked in the trading space myself made us all think about the obvious appeal of using RL/ML to craft a tool to take the tedium out of algorithmic strategy development. Having run through several iterations myself it is a major pain in the a\*\* to locate indicators/backtest/tweakparams/tadjust for risk/repeat.

It struck us that if we could execute and build a tool that truly leverages AI and works, that we could have a shot at giving more people like ourselves, or people who have been beaten down by the markets a better shot at creating a winning strategy. Not saying we are going to beat the market, just that we should all have access to something that makes it even just a little easier to maybe possibly start compounding risk-free profits like Jane Street.

The discouragement is super valid, and it's motivating! Not because I want to prove anyone wrong, I've got nothing to prove, but because I think anyone interested in leveraging AI to create an algorithmic trading strat should be able to, and if we can crack this maybe we have a shot at leveling the playing field even a little bit. Idk, I'm done ranting now, and will go back to building a tool for ya'll. Much love, and may your charts be green.

1nqyeoe,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 07:05:10,You’re losing because you don’t know when to take the right action.,"Your fake guru taught you it’s so simple. You can beat a trillion dollar a day market with just a simple strategy that you do over and over again. 

But when you look around, nobody is making any consistent money doing it. If you were forced to show your trading record in this group, nearly all of you are not profitable with an edge. 

Just seems that way because people only brag about their wins and never show their full transparency. Y’all bust nuts over funding certificates as if that means anything. 3% of people pass challenges, and of those 1% keep a funded account for a year or more. Wrap your head around that one. If you’re doing what everyone else is doing, how the fuck are you going to get into the top 1% of the top 3%?

The strategies you all have chosen are all various hedging tools that you’ve turned into a slot machine.

Each strategy is designed to be unique for the market you’re trading in.

Example. Let’s say earnings are coming up for NVDA. You’re long. Your market bias is long . But you’re concerned the market might move against you. You may have heard of lotto. But a real purpose for that would be to potentially catch the downside action if the stock were to just rip down. So you might buy a put lotto just in case. It’s cheap. And if you don’t want to pay for it, you can cover the upside with a deep OTM call and use those proceeds. 

Now you’re protected. Proper use of a lotto, and you don’t care if it loses, because it was only there to hedge.

Understand profit is made in hedging. You might have heard that the average hedge fund returns 7-8% a year. But what you don’t understand is that 7-8% came from virtually no risk because the markets were hedged. Wealth doesn’t care about doubling accounts. It cares about preservation of wealth.

Most of you will bust when the bear market hits and quit. Because you’re disillusioned by the idea that you think you have an edge but you don’t even want to learn about risk to reward. Listen. Your winrate don’t mean shit. Your ROÍ don’t mean shit.

What was the risk to get the reward. What was that risk in relation to the market where you can just buy and hold. Importantly, what’s your alpha? That’s your ability to profit from the market outside of market momentum. Example might be going long on a stock when the sector itself is crashing, yet you come out with a win.

I promise you, it’s not your psychology that’s failing you. It’s your lack of knowledge on how to trade the financial markets, and the non transparent FTC and SEC investigated influencers told you it was simple.

Well they wouldn’t get you to buy in if you knew absolutely how complex it is to make consistent income over years of time without having to resort to selling to others because you lacked an edge in the end.

You need an arsenal of weaponry, not some stupid set up you think is gonna change your life forever. Maybe, if you’re lucky. But luck isn’t reliable. And edge is. Learn how to read risk immediately or you you will never get to 2-3% monthly returns consistently.

1nqqzzc,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 23:32:49,Backtest results from a neural network,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a personal project I've been working on. This isn't a post to sell anything or promise crazy returns, but rather a showcase of a robust machine learning framework I've developed. The goal was to see if I could build a process that generates a real, verifiable edge, even under difficult market conditions.

For this test, I chose ETHUSD specifically because its price action was choppy and difficult for a significant portion of the backtest period. Here are the high-level results:

    ==================================================
     Results for: v1.9 Daily Model on ETHUSD
     Strategy: 'dynamic_threshold' (T+1 Pricing)
     Date Range: 2024-06-20 to 2025-01-01
    ==================================================
    Starting Capital: $1,000.00
    Ending Capital:   $2,065.49
    Total Return:     106.55%
    --------------------------------------------------
    Total Trades:     41
    Win Rate:         65.85%
    Profit Factor:    6.68
    Max Drawdown:     -8.17%
    ==================================================
    

Now, I know the first reaction to any backtest is skepticism, as it should be. Here are the three most important things about the methodology behind these numbers:

**1. This isn't just a one-off strategy; it's a generalizable framework.** The model's features are based on a proprietary method I developed called the TCXA framework, which models the underlying ""grammar"" of market structure. The same feature engineering and training pipeline that produced this ETH model gets similar results on every asset I've trained it on - BTC, ADA, DOGE. The system is a ""model factory,"" not a single, curve-fit strategy.  

**2. It's rigorously tested on out-of-sample data.** This is not a case of training and testing on adjacent data. The model used for this backtest was trained on data from **2016 through the end of 2023**. The test period you see above begins in **June 2024**, leaving a **6-month gap** of unseen data between training and testing. This is a crucial step to ensure the model has learned real patterns, not just memorized recent price action.  In other tests, I've trained form 2014-2018, tested for 2024 and still got results.  Not as good, but comparable.

**3. The backtest is realistic and free of lookahead bias.** This is the most important point. I've spent more time on the data integrity and MLOps pipeline than on the model itself.

* **No Lookahead:** I have verified that the features generated on historical data are **bit-for-bit identical** to the features the system generates in a live environment.  
* **Conservative T+1 Execution:** The backtest uses a pessimistic ""T+1"" fill model. This means the decision to trade is made at the close of one candle (T), but the trade is simulated as executing on the *next* candle (T+1). To account for slippage and market friction, all buys are filled at the **high** of that next candle, and all sells are filled at the **low**. This ensures the model's edge is strong enough to survive real-world execution conditions.

Here are the visuals for the test period:

**(Equity Curve)**

Using this system, I'm able to train models that predict at all sorts of different timeframes.  This is one of my longer term models - it predicts the return for the next 24 hours every hour.  I am in the process of developing one of these models to post automated trade signals for BTC/USD in real time through my X account, this model is meant to operate at a frequency that a person following it on X could realistically keep up with.  When it's ready I'll write a new post showing recent backtesting details for the specific model it's running.  Until then I'm happy to answer questions.

It’s got nothing to do with charts at all — it’s something in particular I look for, and I found a correlation between the successful ones and the ones that fail. Obviously, I didn’t crack the code, LOL.

But it could just be a dumb coincidence. However, I saw that I would need 1 win to cover 25–40 losses. I used the system and made a handsome return, not in money, but in percentage.

However, I feel skeptical. How do I know if the system I have is the system that’ll work in the future? I mean, unless it’s value investing, I see no other way to tell if the future is bright or not. I don’t want to just “dabble” for 40 years of my life. Any advice?

Even if I lose the next 20–30 times in a row, and one win comes out, who’s to say I’ll win 51 times? Maybe it’ll always stay at 50, and the losses will rack up.

1nqim2d,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 17:04:54,Crypto + Stocks in one place? Here’s my take on RUX,"One of the biggest pains in trading has always been switching between platforms. If you trade crypto and also dabble in stocks, you probably know the hassle: different apps, scattered funds, high spreads, KYC-heavy setups, and delays when you just want to get in and out of a position quickly.

I’ve been looking at how exchanges are trying to solve this, and RUX on Bitget caught my eye. It basically combines stocks and crypto under one roof, so instead of juggling broker accounts and crypto wallets, you can use USDT directly to trade things like NVDA, TSLA, or AAPL with leverage if you want.

It lowers the entry barrier too — instead of needing big capital, you can start with small amounts. And since it’s index-based, pricing feels more transparent compared to relying on a single source.

The idea of blending traditional assets with crypto tools (fast settlement, fractional trading, global access) could be a game-changer for traders who want flexibility without all the usual friction.

1nqij5e,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 17:01:37,"What Losing $72,000 Taught Me About Trading","

I don’t post this to flex or to get sympathy. I’m posting this because every trader at some point hits a wall, and for me that wall cost $72,117. Looking back at those trades, I learned more from that drawdown than from any winning streak I’ve ever had. If you’re in this game, I hope what I share here saves you time, money, and a few blown accounts.

1. Risk management isn’t a suggestion
When I dug into those losses, the biggest mistake wasn’t the setups themselves. It was that I had no consistent risk plan. Sometimes I’d risk $200, sometimes $2,000, depending on how “confident” I felt. Confidence is not risk management. Without a fixed risk per trade, every loss compounds unpredictably. The number that stood out most to me wasn’t the -$72K. It was the 13 consecutive losses. With proper risk sizing, that stretch should have been frustrating, not account-ending.

2. Losing streaks reveal the truth about your process.
It’s easy to feel like a genius when trades are going your way. You start to believe the market “makes sense” and you’ve got it figured out. A real losing streak exposes whether you have an actual system or if you’re just winging it. During those 13 red trades in a row, I realized I didn’t have a defined playbook. I had “ideas” and “feelings”  but nothing I could consistently execute. If you can’t clearly write down your setup, your entry/exit criteria, and your risk rules, you don’t have a strategy. You have hope.

3. The psychological spiral is real.
After a string of red trades, my instinct was to “make it back.” That’s when I started oversizing, taking lower-quality setups, and ignoring my stops. Every losing trader knows this spiral, but very few actually put systems in place to stop it. What I should have done was step away after 3 losses, reset, and review. Instead, I traded through it and bled out. Discipline isn’t about avoiding emotions, it’s about building rules that protect you from yourself when those emotions hit.

4. Journaling turns pain into progress.
The $72K wasn’t wasted because I documented every single one of those trades. I tracked context, entries, exits, and what was going through my head. Patterns became obvious: I was most reckless after 10:30 AM, I entered early instead of waiting for confirmation, and I risked more after a loss. Without journaling, I would’ve walked away with nothing but regret. With it, I built the foundation of my current process.

Losing money doesn’t make you a bad trader. Refusing to learn from it does. If you’re new, don’t wait until you’re $72,000 down to respect risk, build a playbook, and journal your execution. If you’ve already taken big losses, don’t waste them  extract every lesson you can and let the data, not your emotions, shape your next chapter.",175,46,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nqij5e/what_losing_72000_taught_me_about_trading/,new,Due-diligence,0.94

Not the gurus you see, but real ones. They are out there but they are a different breed of person and they don’t have the capital constraints or feelings of money you possess.

If you are dealing with the psychological stresses of trading it’s because you are trading something you shouldn’t be doing.

Zoom out and scale out for the next 20 trades. Watch how your results magically improve.

You don’t have to worry about news, or gaps, or stop hunts, which you have all branded as liquidity sweeps, yet somehow deny that stop hunting isn’t real….. but anyways.

Most of you are better for swing trading or position trading.

You don’t get to join the NBA because you watched Jordan dunk. You don’t just get to succeed at the most highly leveraged variant of trading in the world simply because you think you need to lock in.

Your guru lied to you. 

Start with the basics. If you can’t make a profit in stocks you aren’t going to make a profit in any variation of a derivative of a stock.

All you will do is compound your losses. You should know. If you were honest and posted your last 90 days of trading you’d see the flaws.

And if you’re going to gamble with stocks, then there’s no hope for you at all. If you’re a gambler, stop trading and go back to the casino. Vegas is dying. ",16,21,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nqhtn9/you_are_losing_because_youre_forcing_something/,new,Discussion,0.67

1nqcf9f,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 13:07:18,10 Biggest Mistakes I Made My First Year (And How I Fixed Each One),"**An Autopsy of My First Year ( As requested by yall on my last post)**

My first year of trading was brutal. I thought I was going to get rich quick, but instead I stacked mistake after mistake. Looking back, that year and the 2nd was the most important part of my journey, because it forced me to learn the hard lessons that still guide me today and it helped me realize wehat syle and what markets fit me best!

Here are the 10 biggest mistakes I made and exactly how I fixed them:

1. Oversizing

I’d risk half my account on a single trade because I “knew” it was going to work. Of course, when it didn’t, I wiped out weeks of progress in seconds.

Fix: I committed to fixed risk per trade. Now I size everything in R multiples, win or lose, I know exactly what’s on the line. I styill have dynamic risk but its between 1-4% depending on the trade.

2. No stop losses

I used to believe I could “manage trades manually.” That always ended with me staring at a massive floating loss, hoping it would turn.

Fix: I set hard stops every trade. Even if it’s a painful stop out, it saves me from the catastrophic blowups. I sually tend to take reversals so I set my stop at the new high/low that was set.

3. Strategy hopping

Every week I’d be on YouTube chasing a new “holy grail” system. Supply and demand one week, moving averages the next, then order blocks, then RSI.

Fix: I picked one framework and committed to it for 6 months straight. Consistency of execution was more important than constantly chasing perfection. Backtested the hell out of it with a proper tool, nt just bar replay, then forward tested it.

4. Not journaling

I’d take 20 trades in a week and by Friday I couldn’t even remember half of them. There was no way to know if I was improving or just repeating mistakes.

Fix: I logged every trade, entry, stop, setup, and notes. Now I can look back and clearly see why a trade failed instead of guessing.

5. Trading when emotional

If I lost in the morning, I’d double size in the afternoon trying to make it back. If I was bored, I’d force trades just to “do something.”

Fix: I started tagging trades with emotions in my review. Over time, I noticed revenge trading patterns and cut them out. This was the hardest thing for me to beat. I would go on massive winning streaks but as soon as I had 2-3 lossed, I would go berzerk.

6. Chasing moves

I’d see a big candle rip and jump in late, only to get stopped out when price retraced. FOMO killed me more than bad setups or I would see my A+ setup playout for the day, then get pissed and chase some subpar trade.

Fix: I learned to mark levels ahead of time and wait for price to come to me. My best trades now feel “boring” because they’re planned hours in advance.

7. Ignoring time of day

I used to trade from open to close, thinking more screen time = more money. Instead, I just collected random losses.

Fix: By tracking trades by time, I saw most of my losses came between 8:30-10:30 PST. Now I avoid that window completely and focus on my profitable sessions.

8. No game plan

I’d wake up, open the chart, and hope something obvious would appear. Of course, that led to me forcing setups out of thin air.

Fix: I write a plan before every session with key levels, bullish/bearish scenarios, and triggers. If nothing lines up, I don’t trade and if I don't write a gameplan the day before or prte market, I also don't trade.

9. No weekly review

Every week bled into the next. I never connected the dots between what was working and what wasn’t. Half assing things DOES NOT work in dieting, training, trading or any aspect of life.

Fix: I do a weekend review where I group trades by setup, time, and outcome. That’s where the biggest breakthroughs come from, not daily PnL, but trends over time. I also spend time backtesting 1-2 week of data, every single week without missing a week for over 3 years now.

10. Expecting fast success

I thought I’d be consistent in 6 months. When it didn’t happen, I forced trades to “make up for lost time.” That mindset cost me more than any losing streak.

Fix: I accepted this is a 3-5 year or even longer game. Once I stopped rushing, I focused on the process instead of chasing quick wins. Do not put a time frame on this because that just adds more stress to you.

Trading will humble you. The key is letting those mistakes shape you instead of break you.

It’s what keeping you from being successful.

The psychological warfare is not just from trading. But rather the type of trading you are all trying to achieve. 

The real fight is in accepting that if you want to succeed you first have to get yourself into something that is lightweight and gives you the opportunity to learn about all of the stock market.

It’s not that you don’t want to learn complex option strategies. You just don’t have the time because you spend it glued to charts and backtesting systems that inherently have no edge.

The 3-5 years isn’t about you “locking in” on some wild ass trading. 

It’s about actually learning and growing and developing the proper system in place to take advantage of edges in the market when they appear.

You don’t like me personally. You don’t need to. Honestly, I don’t like you either. So who gives a shit. 

I do something none of your gurus do. Post my entire record. All transparent. And yet, because my returns are 2-3% monthly, you’ll reject that.

Listen.

The Medallion fund is the most legendary fund ever. It was able to gross 60% returns annually for decades. They did so much, that they closed off the fund to new money so they could just internally scale their own capital.

That comes out to about 4% monthly on average compounded. My returns put me easily in the top 10% of traders in the world. 

You doubling an account isn’t a real thing. It’s just a stupid risk. 

You’ve all forgotten compounding returns. You would rather chase the dopamine instead.

My education is free. There is no catch. The only catch is you and your limited belief system.

Two Chinese tech giants are standing out right now: **Alibaba** and **Baidu**.

**Alibaba (BABA)** has had a rough stretch, losing more than 76% at its worst. But this year it’s up \~94%. Its AI push is serious — the Qwen language models, big bets on AI chips and cloud infrastructure — all of it signals Alibaba isn’t just an e-commerce player anymore. At \~18.7× trailing P/E, it’s not expensive given what it's doing. Many investors might be underestimating how much upside is left.

**Baidu (BIDU)** has also been dragging for years, but it’s stirring now—up \~48% over the past month. Its valuation is low (\~12.4× trailing P/E). And with its “Ernie X1.1” reasoning model debuting, it’s directly competing with big names like GPT-5 and Gemini. Baidu has tons of data, which is a huge edge in AI.

Of course, Chinese stocks are volatile, and short-term moves can sting. But for longer game players with some risk tolerance, dipping a toe into Alibaba or Baidu now might pay off if China’s AI evolution continues.

I’ve been trading for about 5 years, mostly selling options, and it’s gone well, but I’m starting to think about how to push growth without just cranking up size on one setup. Curious if diversifying across a few different strategies actually smooths things out in practice, or if it just adds complexity without much benefit.

1npsxvf,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 20:40:09,The End of Diversification Again!The Market is Now a Barbell of State-Sanctioned Tech and Actual Rocks.,"​A few days back, we posted that the market is basically a SPAC for the National Security State. 

The reaction was... spirited. 😵 But the tape this week is screaming that this isn't a pessimistic take it's just the new structural reality. We've officially entered a two track market, and the AI rally just got a beautiful, violent reminder of this when the world's second biggest copper mine shut down and the physical metal went vertical. 

This is the new playbook: a barbell economy where the only things that seem to matter are the politically essential narratives on one side, and the physically-essential resources on the other.
​On one end of the barbell, you have the National Champs Nvidia isn't just investing $100B in OpenAI, it's funding a state sponsored Manhattan Project. 

Intel isn't just raising capital; it's passing the hat from Nvidia to Apple in a government blessed fundraising tour to create a domestic chip cartel. The value of these companies is now a function of political will as much as it is of earnings. 

On the other end, you have the physically scarce inputs this new industrial machine needs to run: copper, lithium, energy. Their value is a function of geology and physical logistics. The fascinating question is what this means for everything caught in the middle. 

Is this the new permanent structure of the market? And if so, is the only winning strategy to own both ends of the barbell and ignore everything else?

Let's brainstorm together

1. Minimize losses

You’ve probably heard that you should cut your losses, but the most important rule is to lose as little as possible. Keep your losses as small as you can.

Similar to a business, if you can keep your losses close to 0, it becomes “easy” to go from red to green.

2. Use a trailing stop

By using a trailing stop loss, you automate some of your risk and money management. The trailing stop also helps you achieve rule number 1, minimize losses!

3. Follow the trend

Trade with the trend, it is your friend. You’ve probably heard that as well, but it is true. Do not trade against the market, in the same way you shouldn’t swim against the flow of a river. Go with the flow, follow the trend. Find a good spot to enter and ride the wave.

4. Don’t try to time the market

If you could time the market, you’d be ultra rich. Instead of trying to time the market, follow your system, your rules and execute an entry or exit based on what your rules say.

5. Trade high probability setups

Wait for the high probability trade setups and only take those positions. Don’t gamble on noise, random setups. By taking high probability setups, it is much easier to turn a profit over time, while following the above rules of course.",13,9,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1npr28s/my_top_5_rules_that_improved_my_stock_trading/,new,Strategy,0.93

If you don’t remember, in 2020, VMware was accused of delaying sales order paperwork to push revenue into the next quarter, allegedly masking its true financial situation. When this came to light, $VMW stock dropped, and investors filed a lawsuit.

The good news is that $VMW settled $102.5M with investors and they’re accepting late claims. 

So here's all I know about this settlement:  

**Q. Who can claim this settlement?**

A. Anyone who purchased or otherwise acquired $VMW from August 24, 2018, to February 27, 2020.  

**Q. Do I need to sell/lose my shares to get this settlement?**

A. No, if you have purchased $VMW during the class period, you are eligible to participate.

**Q. How much money do I get per share?**

A. The estimated payout is $1.87 per share, but the final amount will depend on how many shareholders file claims.

**Q. How long does the payout process take?**

A. It typically takes 8 to 12 months after the claim deadline for payouts to be processed, depending on the court and settlement administration.

You can check if you are eligible and file a claim here: [https://11th.com/cases/vmware-investor-settlement](https://11th.com/cases/vmware-investor-settlement)",1,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1npiwoo/faq_for_getting_payment_on_vmware_1025m_investor/,new,General news,1.0

My approach was simple: watch the live trades they publish, mirror a small number of signals manually, and slowly scale exposure when comfortable. There were a few clear patterns:

* Short timeframe bots (like 1-15m) move fast and cost you in fees/slippage unless you're fully automated.
* Transparency matters – platforms that show trade histories and performance metrics are way easier to test.
* Even with a decent win rate, a handful of big losers will gut returns if risk management isn't solid

I didn't blindly copy everything – i cherry-picked trades/signals that made the most sense to me. I tried a couple of big names like trade ideas, trend spider, tickeron, and a few smaller platforms. Now i've ended up sticking with tickeron (it's not perfect and was a bit confusing at first, but their transparency and the ability to watch live trades/stats across hundreds of trading bots made the difference for me).

The U.S. grid is racing to catch up: utility-scale batteries are set to more than double by end-2025 (30–37 GW), and developers are adding record gas capacity alongside renewables to keep data centers online.    
  
Who looks best positioned (my view):   
  
$CEG (largest U.S. nuclear fleet => 24/7 carbon-free baseload)  
  
$NEE (massive renewables + storage pipeline tied to hyperscalers)  
  
$BEP (inked a 10.5 GW global renewables deal with Microsoft)  
  
$FLNC (grid-scale storage integrator for firming), plus regulated utilities with robust interconnection footprints.

I want to sell all and cash in my profits as the position is now up over 100%. My question is should I wait a few minutes at open for the price to settle or should I just set a market sell order before prior to marker opening. I want to hold onto as much of that 80% gain as possible is there any downfalls to setting a market sell order prior to open ? Do I risk loosing some of those gains to increased market volatility?

I wrote random notes here and there, but never with consistency and definitely not in a way that made me a better trader.

I hand wrote evrything, highlighted and marked stuff, never had any data I needed accesable to me.



Now, journaling is my most important edge. This is exactly what my workflow looks like:



**What I log after every trade:**



Entry, exit, stop, and R multiple.



Setup type (was it A+, B, or just emotional?).



Time of day (NY open, lunch chop, etc.).



What I was feeling before/during/after.

**How I review each trade:**



I look at screenshots and ask: “Did price action confirm my idea, or did I force it?”



I tag trades by session and setup so I can see patterns in bulk. (Mistakes, Playbooks, Custom tags..)



https://preview.redd.it/3bvzk0e3k1rf1.png?width=361&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b4c8eb6a4f50dd5d2f85db89606a9288c1f9ade

I grade myself not just on win/loss but on execution. A “good loss” is still a win if I followed my process. That's how I always wrapo up my journal for the day, if I ened in green or red.

**How it’s helped me improve:**



I spotted that my worst trades always came between 8:30-10:30 PST and Asia session, so I just cut that window out.

https://preview.redd.it/9w5r7gbzj1rf1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=f842ca399160d51c15fc902c3caaa3d5ed583bb9

I learned I only needed 1-2 solid setups a day instead of chasing everything.



I built confidence, because I wasn’t trading based on vibes,  I had the data in front of me.





Journaling isn’t about writing more. It’s about writing the right things and reviewing them the right way. That’s where the growth happens.



What do you want to see next?



A) A full breakdown of my weekly review process.



B) A real trade example with my notes and what I learned.



C) How I use tags to find which setups actually make me money.

1np0zqv,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 22:46:09,coming to 3 years trading full time,"I am a swing trader. Holding a trade for few weeks. I trade stocks and futures.  
  
I had dabbled in trading part-time starting in 2015, but in 2021, something changed. I found the right path, and it became a total obsession. The next two years were about complete focus with thousands of hours glued to charts, internalizing my setups.  My trading is hugely influenced by Mark Minervini and his VCP pattern. That is still pretty much what I trade. 

I had been fortunate in my career (the Bay Area pays well) and had saved over a million dollars. When I decided to go full-time, I did it cautiously, allocating only 25% of my savings to trading capital.

My first full-time year, 2023, was a struggle for months. With my swing trading style, there are long periods where the market isn't giving me anything. Then, August came. I caught a monster trend and it felt like everything clicked into place. I ended the year up 100%.

The second year started strong, but then I did something profoundly stupid. I took on a tremendous amount of risk on a new instrument and it went sideways. It was my worst drawdown. That one mistake weighed heavy on me. For the most of the year, I was wrestling with self-doubt, failing to execute top setups. I ended the year up 8%, but I know that I'd thrown away at least a 30% year.

This year, I've done almost everything right. I've been disciplined and followed my process, and I'm up over 30%. But the mental struggle is constant. 

After just a few losses, I still wonder if I'll ever have a winning trade again.

This is a very hard profession. The way I trade, where I make the vast majority of my money in just a few weeks in an entire year, takes a huge mental toll. 

After a few string of losses, I still find it incredibly difficult to risk - 1-2% of my account - even on top setup. I hope I can get better at this.

The business of trading is simple.
Find trends, ride it till it ends.
Doesn’t matter what setup you use to enter, pick one, stick to that shit.
Cut losses the moment your idea is invalidated. 
Protect mental capital at all costs. Why would you sit around for days in the red. Just cut that shit and go on to live another day, stress free. You can always enter again.
Scale into winners, that’s how you make the big bucks. Gradual exposure to a winning trade, not by doubling down on a looser cuz you think it’s gonna bounce.

This business is always going to have an element of discretion and feel. Do what you can to add structure but learning to feel the market is not a science. It’s energy, it’s flow, it’s market sentiment. Add whatever technicals you want but you can’t pinpoint an abstract thing. BUT, you will fail without some kind of structure. So accept that paradox of the market. 

You will never know what is going to happen next. Do whatever analysis you want. Crunch all the numbers. Read all the news. But when you put on risk, expect that you will loose.

This shit takes time. It’s a skill. Clicking the button isn’t the skill, it’s everything behind the click. Any avg joe can make money once, but to make it consistently, through many market storms, is what makes someone a trader. When times are good, everyone makes money. But in the bad times, who keeps their winnings?

Ever since that FOMC when we saw the Fed has penciled in two more cuts for 2025, markets have been chugging away on that optimism. 

Gold has move over a 1000pips since that FOMC, SPX chugging away into the 6700s, and DXY holding a lot weaker into the 97s.

Someone who avoids ""fundamentals"" or ""news"" may be looking for reversals or tops thinking ""gold has gone up so much it must sell now"" but we have since chugged away into the 3800s now in the spot market.   
  
If you understood fundamentals, you would know Gold will continue to rip on that rate cut optimsim, so the only trade ideas you should be executing on, or at least the one with the higher probability is buys. Pullback - buy, continuation - buy.

1nos48l,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 16:15:49,3 years of trading: The brutal lessons I wish someone told me sooner,"I’ve been trading seriously for about 3 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up small accounts, overleveraged, revenge-traded, and gone through the cycle of overconfidence → humility → back to square one. I’m not a guru, I’m not here to sell you anything. I just want to share the lessons that actually stuck with me, because I wish I had internalized these from day one.

1. Risk management isn’t optional it’s survival

Everyone says “risk management matters” but you don’t really understand it until you blow up a few accounts. The truth is, you can have a 40–50% win rate and still be profitable if your winners are bigger than your losers. But if you don’t cap your risk per trade (1–2% of account size), you’re basically playing Russian roulette. One stubborn “this has to bounce” moment can erase months of progress.

2. The market doesn’t reward effort it rewards discipline

I used to believe that the harder I studied, the more setups I should be able to find. Wrong. Most days, there’s nothing worth trading. Some of my best weeks came from taking only 3–4 trades total. Sitting on your hands feels lazy at first, but the reality is: trading more doesn’t equal earning more. It usually equals bleeding more.

3. Overcomplication is a trap

In my first year, my charts looked like a Christmas tree: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci levels, you name it. I thought the “secret” was hidden in some magical indicator combination. After testing for months, I came back to basics: clean levels, volume, and price action. Most pros I’ve observed keep it shockingly simple because clutter breeds hesitation, and hesitation costs money.

4. Journaling turned me from “random clicking” into an actual trader

I resisted journaling for the longest time. Felt tedious. But when I finally did it, patterns jumped out: I overtraded after losses, I closed winners too early when I was scared, I took dumb setups when I was bored. None of that was visible on my P&L alone. Writing down the why behind each trade gave me brutal but necessary feedback.

5. Trading will expose your psychology faster than anything else

The market is the best mirror you’ll ever have. If you’re impatient in life, you’ll overtrade. If you’re stubborn, you’ll refuse to cut losers. If you’re greedy, you’ll size up too soon. I used to think trading was about charts now I know it’s mostly about emotional control. If you don’t fix your mindset, no strategy will save you.

6. You don’t need to “quit your job” to be a trader

This one took me a while. I used to idolize the idea of being a “full-time trader” with no other income. The truth ? Having a second income stream actually helps you trade better, because you’re not desperate for every single trade to pay your bills. Desperation makes you reckless. A job or side hustle gives you breathing room, which translates into better decisions.

7. Consistency > jackpots

My biggest trap was thinking I needed one massive trade to “make it.” The truth is, trading is about grinding out small, consistent gains while keeping losses tiny. A steady +$100 a day is infinitely more powerful (and sustainable) than swinging for +$1,000 and wiping out half your account.",764,111,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nos48l/3_years_of_trading_the_brutal_lessons_i_wish/,new,Advice,0.97

Curve-fitting, lucky streaks, or unusual market conditions can all distort the picture.

That’s why professional quants often use **Monte Carlo simulations**. Instead of relying on one equity curve, the strategy is tested thousands of times with randomized trade sequences, volatility shocks, and variations. The result isn’t a pretty curve – it’s a **range of possible futures**.

We built a tool that does exactly this:

* ✅ Run thousands of equity-curve variations
* ✅ Measure probability of drawdowns
* ✅ Estimate realistic return/risk expectations

1nolq6z,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 12:15:31,Why I Stopped Using Single Indicators (Multi-Confirmation Strategy Results),"After losing Money following RSI divergences blindly, I rebuilt my entire approach around multiple indicator confirmation. Turns out most retail traders fail because they act on ONE signal.

**The Problem with Single Indicators:**

* RSI shows ""oversold"" → price keeps falling
* MACD crossover → turns out to be noise
* Breakout confirmed → immediately reverses

**The Multi-Confirmation Framework I Use Now:**

**Layer 1: Momentum**

* RSI (14) + Stochastic (14,3,3)
* Both must align—no single momentum signal

**Layer 2: Trend**

* EMA crossover (9/21) + ADX > 25
* Confirms directional strength, filters sideways chop

**Layer 3: Volume**

* Volume > 20-day average + Volume Rate of Change
* No breakouts without volume backing

**Layer 4: Support/Resistance**

* Price action at key levels + Bollinger Bands
* Entry only near logical S/R zones

**The Magic: 3 out of 4 layers must confirm before I enter.**

**Real Example (RELIANCE - Aug 2024):**

* RSI + Stochastic both oversold ✓
* EMA crossover + ADX rising ✓
* Volume spike on bounce ✓
* Bounce from 200-day MA ✓
* Result: 12% gain in 3 weeks vs. 2% loss following RSI alone

**Backtested Results (500+ trades):**

* Win rate: 62% vs. 38% with single indicators
* Average R:R improved from 1:1.2 to 1:1.8
* Max consecutive losses dropped from 9 to 4

**Key Learning:** Markets are noisy. Multiple confirmations filter out 80% of false signals, leaving you with higher-probability setups.

The patience to wait for 3-4 confirmations is what separates profitable traders from the 95% who chase every signal.

One of the most overlooked skills in forex trading isn’t predicting the market — it’s staying consistent. Many traders jump from one strategy to another, chasing quick profits, but this often leads to frustration and losses.

Consistency means:

Following your trading plan every day, without skipping steps.

# WAIT!

**This post is a critique, not an attack. Actionable insights are provided**

This doesn't come from a place of ignorance. I don't debate what I don't know. This post is in good faith.

Many people choose to dismiss ICT as a ""fraud"", but let’s look into it together.

# The institutional story & why retail traders find it appealing

ICT, to most retail traders, is convincing; by design, it helps them feel reassured and in control; it subconsciously satisfies your psychological needs if you believe in the theory, which is desirable but not beneficial for most.

**This study shows that most humans are even willing to give up financial gain to feel in control.**

The value of control

Moritz Reis, Roland Pfister, Katharina A. Schwarz

I'm sure you can relate if you are a discretionary ICT trader or an ex-ICT trader; the **Ad-hoc reasoning** makes the trader feel like they know what’s happening in the market(s) they’re trading and why things have taken place, present and past. The **hindsight bias** is also brutal due to the excesssive number of entry methods provided.

**The need for control is innate in us; it's how we're wired as humans.**

The data snooping across multiple timeframes displayed by most discretionary ICT traders makes it conveniently harder to expose again, by design.

**ICT/SMC is convoluted and discretionary likely on purpose, making it difficult for people to refute. It often presents like a shared belief system, rather than a straight forward replicable framework.**

**The burden of proof** constantly gets shifted, and circular reasoning pops up. ICT is designed to feel underpinned by logic and complex, but it’s mostly a mixture of heuristics and untestable narratives.

# SMC theory goes against market fundamentals [2]

[MMXM](https://preview.redd.it/kn35ycivtwqf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=463f698e663f27bc13df5b312324e565dc85598c)

**ICT example of supposed ""Market Maker Behaviour""**

https://preview.redd.it/iu4w6gvwtwqf1.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cd2c95d0b0adc548350558e622feee45fad6482

**Realistic Market Maker Behaviour**

**Market makers rarely engineer large movements over several ticks because of inventory risk.**

**I have provided institutional-grade literature which explains this in-depth towards the end.**

Understand that i'm not saying “stop hunting” never happens; it’s just rare and misrepresented by trading gurus to an extreme point. An MM moving price by a point to “sweep” liquidity is not the same as an MM moving price by 10+ points to induce/sweep liquidity; it's far too risky for them to do that, with rare exceptions.  
Even a 10-point move on index futures is large for a market maker.

**Here is an example (Futures):**

Let's make the current price 20010.00 and the price in focus 20000.00. -10 handles.  
If a predictive HFT MM Algo anticipates they'll be 3000 contracts 10 handles / $10 away from the current price and the algo anticipates the market impact per handle to be 200, leaving a +1000 contract discrepancy if the price is met, they wouldn't commit the 2000 contracts to spike the price most of the time even though it's logical because the inventory risk accumulation or chance of adverse selection would be too high even if they spread it out.

**They could be stuck with -2000 contracts on the wrong side of the market and lose a lot of money; all it takes is for a different algorithm to match their flow to nullify their market impact completely.**

**Here's the nuance, though:** if the price was already trading at that point that's $10 away from the current price and their predictive model still supports the decision they could provide liquidity at 20000.00 but also influence the price to trigger the orders but only if close and highly probable. For example, if the price is at 20000.50, they could sell a couple of hundred to flush the final buyers to trigger the anticipated order flow.

**The point is it's extremely unlikely for Market makers to influence larger movements/spikes to tap into anticipated liquidity unless the level is extremely close to where price discovery is taking place already. So it's the other market participants trading towards that level; that's the true causation, not the MMs.**

Some ICT traders will win; an overwhelming majority will lose. Even if all PD Arrays were ""applied correctly"" & if everyone traded ICT the exact same way, they'd be market crowds that'd be faded and cause alpha decay if there was any edge to begin with.

Note: Alpha decay is when a strategy loses its edge from being well known and executed.

I'm sure small market crowds from ICT trading behaviour already exist and are occasionally arbitraged by algos due to margin/trade size used & retail popularity. Predictable crowd flow gets faded. It’s not a conspiracy; it’s an industry fact.

# I've seen ICT work for others, so it must work, right? [3]

**This is a survivorship bias classic.**

[Traders still have a chance to make money with losing strategies](https://preview.redd.it/0kh6l9d3uwqf1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=62aed3c72c6d66c05d2fa11ec21e5fa9910ae840)

**As you can see here traders can make money with unprofitable strategies not Break-even. unprofitable.**

Anecdotal examples ≠ viability. Anecdotes don't hold weight.

If blackjack is rigged against the player, how come some gamblers made millions in Vegas without card counting? Ex. Dana White

Because it's a numbers game, and it all averages out.

Most ICT traders are losing money just like most gamblers in Vegas. But the wins are what's displayed, not the guy who lost his house in 100 hands.

It's the same thing with trading poorly modelled ideas, like most discretionary applications of ICT.

A few outliers will always exist; anecdotes do not replace systematic evidence.

There are academic-grade papers showing even coin flips can have periods of profitability coincidentally.

[Much more variance in outcomes is shown with zero edge](https://preview.redd.it/o21y1mo8uwqf1.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=0513aa7bba6bbadff4ad2cd8673cde7d719a69e6)

Most ICT traders don't collect first-party data on rule-based strategies (executed mechanically or with discretion); this is their downfall.

Few are the exception.

# Analogy (going deeper) [3]

SMC is like a “science” that never gets a fair test. The post isn’t to provoke and upset it’s to educate it’s not opinion it’s based on facts and visual evidence.

**ICT deals with time series data (OHLC), so data science rules do apply, but ICT’s application of “his concepts” violates standard data analysis principles. Whilst still having the illusion of rigour**

Price discovers quotes; it doesn’t “deliver them”. You’re wasting your time with theory. Half of what ICT says about inefficiency is correct; unfortunately, the rest of it is noise.

E/EV is the average net return per trade ex 1:2 with a 50% winrate is 0.5R avg profit per trade. E.g. (-1+2-1+2)/4 = 0.5R avg gain

[ICT DISTILLATION TOWER \(Analogy\)](https://preview.redd.it/baekswfduwqf1.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=b711296a78dac92b4850cbbf61aa740a148e2a17)

Think of ICT like fractional distillation, but you have a range of temperatures where you can extract a substance instead of the specific temperature required. Only a loose guide. That’s similar to data snooping and the other data science flaws when applied.

The point is you might still get the substance you need from the distillation process but a lot of excess time and energy is wasted because you don’t apply the correct amount of heat, etc.

That’s how I feel about ICT concepts. Decent, unoriginal techniques, but there's a lot of noise during the application.

If you want to know how prices really work look at books and papers talking about **liquidity provision, price discovery** and **market auctions** for the truth.

# Definitions [4]:

Alpha Decay  
When a trading strategy loses its edge because too many people use it or the market adapts. Any advantage gets diluted or arbitraged away over time, especially when strategies are shared publicly.

Julien Penasse - Understanding alpha decay

Ad hoc reasoning is when someone makes up an explanation on the spot to justify or defend their belief or theory; typically, after the fact in an ICT context, it’s usually tied to hindsight bias.

Anecdotal Evidence

Personal stories or isolated examples. Common in retail (""I saw someone make $1M prop firm withdrawals using SMC!""), but not reliable proof of a strategy’s viability.

First-party Data

Data collected directly from a trader’s own trades. Backtests or forward tests; not taken from others' results or community anecdotes. As I’ve suggested, high-quality, first-party data is essential for knowing if a system actually has an edge. A Key marker for strategy substance.

Coin Flip Analogy  
Used in this to reveal that even completely random methods can appear profitable in the short term due to chance. Useful for exposing how randomness/noise can be mistaken for skill in financial markets.

Data Snooping (in trading)

Inconsistently looking at the same data (chart) multiple times over multiple timeframes and scenarios to justify a trade. Discretionary traders often do this to fish for “confluence” to validate their trading idea.

Burden of Proof

The responsibility to provide evidence for a claim. In trading especially, it should always fall on the person promoting a strategy, not the skeptic asking for proof it’s effective.

Hindsight Bias  
When a trader believes, after a trade’s outcome is known, that they would’ve known the result. Common in discretionary trading and journaling, where charts are reviewed after moves happen, making everything look obvious in retrospect, especially with ICT.

Survivorship Bias  
Focusing primarily on the positive events/wins while ignoring the majority of instances, which are negative. In trading, it's when people point to profitable traders using a method (typically baseless) without acknowledging how many used the same method and lost money.

Circular Reasoning  
The logical fallacy where the conclusion is included in the premise. In trading, a good example is saying a method works because it works, without solid evidence. Often shows up in unverified trading strategies. (no quality first-party data)

# Summary/TLDR Can ICT/SMC be salvaged and used?

Many of the ideas are weak, but VERY few take advantage of actual short-term market inefficiencies, so if you insist on using it, you must do high-quality first-party backtesting first, per setup, per instrument, which takes a lot of work. An overwhelming majority of ICT traders skip this; that's their downfall.

If you insist on using “ICT’s ideas”, which we don’t, just like anything, make sure you rigorously test it on every instrument you run individually without tweaks or curve fitting. Or you don’t know how effective it really is or if it has any edge at all. **Unfortunately, ICT shares the same structural weaknesses as many retail systems: heavy discretion in most applications, limited first-party testing and heightened potential exposure to alpha decay.**

[Real Backtesting Data Example](https://preview.redd.it/o57evfniuwqf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c2786e85d235e13de99e65115060c50c04c7f83)

If you're going to use ICT make purely mechanical trading strategies based on logic rather than narrative skip things like MMXM and focus on more basic setups like breakers, mitigation, fvg and so on and build from there. If you are going to do multiple timeframe analysis use the same timeframes in the same order, per setup for consistent execution priority and to prevent look-ahead bias.

1noh5ve,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 09:18:13,The harsh truths nobody tells you about trading,"Most people come into day trading with dreams of financial freedom, working from a laptop, and making thousands before lunch time. And i honestly don’t blame them.. that’s how it’s sold online. But the reality of day trading is a lot harsher than what you see here from /r/wallstreetbets screenshots. For those who are serious about this, i wanted to list some of the truths most people won’t tell you until you’ve already lost a ton of money. This is part of an ongoing education series on reddit, if you like write ups like these, follow my account for more.

1. Most people lose money (and keep losing).

It’s estimated that 80 to 90% of traders fail, and that stat is no joke. The market is a zero-sum game; your wins come from someone else’s losses, and when you’re new, you’re the one feeding the experienced players. No strategy, guru, or indicator will change the fact that you’re paying tuition to the market in the beginning.

The hard part isn’t just learning setups..  it’s surviving long enough to actually get good. And the majority never make it past that stage because they run out of money or burn out mentally before they develop any consistency.

2. It takes years, not months, to get consistent.

A lot of beginners think they’ll be profitable within 6 months if they just grind hard enough. The truth is it usually takes 2 to 3 years of daily effort before you can really call yourself consistent. That’s thousands of hours of screen time, journaling, reviewing trades, and slowly building emotional resilience.

If that sounds like too much, trading probably isn’t for you. This is more like learning a professional craft (surgery, law, engineering) than picking up a side hustle. If you treat it like a shortcut, you’ll blow up.

3. Trading is boring when done right.

The highlight reels on social media show explosive wins and big green days. What you don’t see is that consistent trading is painfully repetitive. You’re taking the same setups over and over, cutting losers quickly, and stacking small wins.

If you’re looking for excitement, you’ll force trades, gamble on hype stocks, and churn your account into dust. The truth is the boring traders are the ones still around after 5 years.

4. Your emotions are your biggest enemy.

Everyone thinks they’ll be calm and logical until they watch their P/L swing hundreds or thousands in seconds. Fear makes you sell winners too early, greed makes you hold losers too long, and ego makes you size up when you shouldn’t.

No book or strategy will fix this for you; you only learn by facing it. The sooner you realize trading is 80% psychology and 20% strategy, the sooner you’ll start working on the real skill set that matters.

5. You won’t get rich with a small account.

Turning $1k into $100k in a year makes for a great screenshot, but it’s not reality. A small account limits your options and magnifies your risk. Realistic growth is slow, and it compounds over time. If you’re starting with $1 to 2k, your first goal should be survival and skill-building, not quitting your job.

The harsh truth is trading for income requires a big enough account to absorb losses and still generate meaningful returns. You don’t have to start huge, but you do need realistic expectations about what’s possible.

**Bottom Line**

Day trading isn’t the glamorous, quick-money lifestyle most people think it is. It’s a grind, it’s boring when done right, and it takes years to develop the skills and mindset needed to survive. If you’re still reading this and it doesn’t scare you off, that’s a good sign... you might have the patience and discipline to actually stick it out. Follow me for my next post.

1nogcmt,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 08:43:10,How to get funded and stay funded.,"You have to minimize your risk.

You need to set your position size in accordance to the notional value of your account.

For a standard 50k prop account that’s pretty much one micro.

You have to trade multiple assets.

One instrument and one asset is t going to cut it. Simplicity is the first round of liquidity 

You need for them to be uncorrelated. 

Example MBT, MCL, MES, and MGC. 

Prop firms want you to fail. It’s how they keep making money. You actually know this. You don’t want to accept it. That’s the mentality they thrive on. Your irrational understanding of risk and your desire for continuous dopamine.

Perfect storm to bleed you dry.

Despite hedging to be a very viable means of trading, example going long term long on ES, you can take a short on MES. Two different trades, for one simple purpose. Effectively hedging to minimize losses. Banned by prop firms.

By trading multiple assets with a single micro each you’re keeping yourself in the game. 

Your stop. Way the fuck away from the noise. If your stop is anywhere near price action, you’re liquidity. Get out of your head that you want to intraday trade. That only makes sense if you’re hedging a larger portfolio. 

You have to swing trade. But with props you have to manage actively by getting out at the end of the day and getting back in. You lose that hour but the gaps wont matter anymore because you’re on a low risk.

But if you’re riding out the higher time frame, you can capture days of price movement. Each day if price improved your market bias, add another micro and move in your stop. That’s how you’ll get your convexity. Your initial risk is narrow but you can scale into winners. 

Rinse repeat. You won’t bust. You’ll always be in the game. The drawback is that it takes a couple months as you’re only going for 2-3 percent returns a month on average. That’s where the gamblers lose their mind. 

Part of the 3-5 year window to being a pro trader just isn’t on knowledge, but actually building up your account. Allow compounding nature to work in your favor. 

You can’t get there on high risk. 

Chart on the daily, trade on the 15 minute. Set and forget. Repeat the next trading day. Generally between four to six assets you’ll have an opportunity to trade to satisfy the requirements of the prop firm. And since you’re closing out positions daily, you won’t need to worry about consistency rules. Your big win isn’t in a single day, but in a series of trades over the duration of the macro trend.

Attached is Silver ETF (SLV) monthly chart; for your information, SLV per share is slightly cheaper than spot per ounce (about $3 less), please do your addition when converting to spot.

The price movement of SLV, starts to show some stunning similarities to 2011 peak. In 2011 frenzy, silver broke out the rising channel (dotted line), then fell back hard for the next 5-10 years. This is 2025, another similar rising channel also formed, and we're rapidly approaching the breakout point AGAIN.

Is 2026 going to be a replay of 2011? well, it depends on the trading volume. At 2011's blow-off top, volume surged to crazy levels; we have NOT seen it yet. However by looking into the chart, I am worried it's gonna be a deja vu.

It took me a 5000 dollar course to realize 5 years ago, that the market INDUCES you to take position, then gives you a few pips to boost your ego and confidence, only to then reverse against you REALLY hard, not giving you a chance to pull out. This is one of the many reasons why risk management is CRUCIAL.

Whether you're using ICT, Elliot Waves, EMAs, Stochastic, or Bollinger bands or WHATEVER method, the market will trigger your setup and excite you to enter only to screw you. If they're showing you a Bollinger buy entry, they're showing someone else an Elliot Wave sell entry. Then the market triggers your stops on BOTH sides before ultimately going in whichever direction it wants to go.

You gamble.

You lose.

Any viable strategy needed to survive the markets is entirely negated by the way you engage prop firms.

You just don’t really need to trade everyday on the same asset with the same instrument. And you shouldn’t. 

You trade MES to hedge the delta against your portfolio when the market takes a sharp turn. Or perhaps to amplify delta if it’s lagging and the market is moving stronger than your bias.

In that one process you’re not trading everyday. You’re trading when needed and for some, it may be a perpetual hold to manage the granularity of their portfolio.

Y’all overleveraged on account sizes as well. Nobody should be trading NQ or any mini. You just don’t have the account size for it.

Most of you could probably survive a lot longer if you just traded one micro. Instead you’re just busting out accounts left and right. That’s not the type of trading any firm wants.

They let you gamble high risks and you do.

If there was a prop firm that only let you trade a single micro for every $50k they would not get any business. Despite that being the way to trade. 

Part of the 3-5 year journey isn’t just in the learning how to trade. It’s in building up your account and allowing compounding earnings generate massive results.

But no. That’s too far away. Trading has turned into just a casino. 

I’ll follow up in the next post on what you should do to pass these prop firms to get funded and to stay funded.

1no8jez,2025-09-23,2025-09-23 00:57:02,Is This Solid Journaling?,"Just getting into trading and just focusing on paper trading for a while. I have a simple strategy I came up with that is a rendition of Tori Trade's strategy. If you aren't familiar, she draws trend lines top down and then sees which way it breaks. I'm basically doing that, but adding simple price action layers on top like noticing support and resistance as well. I also trade the 5 minute and jump down to the 1 minute to look for a couple candlestick patterns. I only have the engulfing and marubozu patterns ""learned"" (recognizable). Again, I am just starting so just keeping it super simple with price action, plus the 1 minute chart doesn't really hold a lot of weight with candlestick patterns I feel like, especially because almost every candle is probably a pattern at that time frame. So really I am just taking the trade even if I do not recognize an entry candle pattern when it closes past a trend line.

It may not be the best strategy in the world, but I feel like I am learning. I got an interest in trading about a week and a half ago or so, and I have been consuming a bunch of content until I stumbled upon Tori and it just clicked for me.

Anyways, just looking to see if there is anything else I should add to my trade logs. I wanna actually try to learn this. So, if there are any additional things I should be journaling, please let me know, and remember I just want to keep it simple.

Edit: and I just started, so don't be too rough. The trade values take a jump, because I discovered prop firms. I decided once I get comfortable to the point of using real money, in several months, I would much rather spend $200 to try my shot at getting access to a 50k account. Even though there are strict rules. So, I reset my account as well to adjust for practicing for that. I am still taking it as serious as possible though.

Good morning fellow devotees of the Bloomberg Terminal. 

Today, it would appear that the market isn’t just a market... but a geopolitical fanfic where NVIDIA drops $100 billion! yes, a number usually reserved for small wars or large moons into OpenAI to build an AI infrastructure so vast it’s basically a digital Vatican for the machine god. (It's nice to see them spending their war chest of late isn't it?)

IMHO this isn’t investing; it’s a corporate power grab that could fund clean water for the planet (or my latest online horse betting venture) but instead screams, We’ll out-compute the world! 

The market, ever the enabler, sent NVIDIA’s stock to the moon, because nothing says bullish like betting on a friendly Skynet. Meanwhile, Oracle’s been tapped as TikTok’s algorithm babysitter, a move so drenched in Langley vibes it might as well come with a trench coat and sunglasses. And let’s not overlook the Fed’s newest governor, Stephen Miran, openly stumping for rate cuts like he’s auditioning for a cabinet post, while gold and the S&P 500 hold hands at all-time highs like they’re in a buddy cop movie. 

This isn’t trading at all like we have been saying for the last few weeks, it’s conscription into a centrally planned bull market where every ticker salutes the flag. Long gold miners (GDX) for the chaos hedge, Oracle (ORCL) for its new role as national security mascot, or fade that Baby Shark IPO for the lolz....pick your side in this glorious mess, because we’re all industrial policy quants now. Thoughts?

Oh, and the scorecard for those hating of late. my long Intel call from last week is printing like a laser thanks to that rival bailout, the SMH/KWEB pairs trade is still a geopolitical cash machine, and the leveraged steepener’s biding its time for the yield curve to wake up.(the recent move has helped)

For the YOLO crowd, shorting Baby Shark post pop or buying Argentine bonds on the Treasury’s “we got you” vibe could be quick wins. 

Let’s argue about it in the comments am I a genius or just yelling at clouds? (Hello.. anyone in there)

Traditional indicators work great... until they don't. RSI, MACD, moving averages—they all lag because they're reactive. By the time your charts show a bear market has started, you've already lost 15-20%.

The real game-changer? **Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for regime detection.** These AI models don't just analyze price—they identify the *underlying market state* in real-time.

Here's what I've learned:

* Markets aren't random—they follow distinct ""regimes"" (bull, bear, sideways)
* Each regime has different volatility patterns and price behaviors
* HMM can detect regime shifts 2-3 weeks before traditional indicators
* Combining this with sentiment analysis from news/social data = powerful edge

Example: In March 2020, HMM models flagged the regime change to ""high volatility bear"" 12 days before most technical indicators caught up. That's the difference between protecting capital and watching it evaporate.

Been backtesting strategies that adapt based on detected regimes rather than fixed rules. The results are eye-opening—14% higher win rates and 18% lower max drawdown compared to static approaches.

Anyone else experimenting with regime-aware trading? The math behind market microstructure is wild once you dig into it.*.*",0,14,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nnycjg/why_most_retail_traders_fail_to_spot_market/,new,Technical analysis,0.5

We've also had conversations with several traders who are deep into backtesting who have complained about feeling burnt-out, fatigued, low energy, and an inability to push through their work.

I’ve just started forex trading and I’m currently in my second week on a demo account. So far, what I feel is that trading is 90% psychology/instincts and only about 10% technicals (charts, indicators, etc.).

A trader I know told me a simple rule: “always buy when it’s a buyer’s market and always sell when it’s a seller’s market” – and surprisingly, that approach has been working for me.

Here’s how I trade right now:

I always use TP, but I don’t place a SL (and so far it has worked for me).

I treat this demo as if it’s real money – I take the same pressure I would on a live account.

Even though the demo balance is $3k, I consider it more like $100–200 in my mind to keep myself grounded.

After two weeks, my success rate is around 97%.

I know this is still very early and demo trading isn’t the same as real trading, but I’d love to hear from you guys:

What should I do further before switching to a live account?
Any habits, strategies, or mindsets I should build at this stage to prepare myself?

I only traded in these because I didn't want to get liquidated by a huge volatility in market out of nowhere. My capital was 80$.... A pretty small one you could say. In the first few days I traded I made some profit and losses but overall my capital reached 130$.... I was happy with it and was planning how I would have 500$ by the end if this month and in process like this I would probably be having 7-8k before the end if this year.... Unfortunately dreams are just dreams, I was using 100% of my capital and with a 10x leverage so I could make like 10-15% a day. But I didn't put stop loss at all because I thought why I need I am playing in choppy market and so I didn't put it up and I accidentally fall asleep one night when my trade was active and by the morning I woke up, instead of feeling the bitter taste of coffee..... I felt the bitter taste of sleeping so peacefully.... I lost about 70 dollars in just one trade from then on I thought I would close my trade whenever the price rich 20% of my capital in loss and I followed it for a couple of times and was in a loss and profit face but I was seeing that the price bounces back just after I take exit in loss, it's like market was just after me..... Sigh I am still thinking like that. Anyways it led me to believe I should remove it since price bounces back so I didn't put it up and this led to  a trade on 40% loss but since it was a weekend and crypto goes down so I did hold it for the weekend and just today the trade and crypto market suddenly dropped so much and I completely got liquidated, at the end of time I closed my 50% trade thinking I saved some capital but forgot that the trade was on cross mode and not in isolated so I lost completely because the sharp drop today was something I haven't seen since I started trading..... I have made some huge mistakes but they were worth it to make me learn something, I always thought lossing money just feels like heartache but it also feels like a teaching fees..... Now I am thinking that I should paper trade for a week, my strategy is that I should only invest 10% of my capital and risk it entirely either I am gonna win 10% more or loss that for the day and stop trading that day so I am only loosing 10% a day and my strategy will work but only in a choppy market I should avoid during high volume hours and should just stick with scalping and not just get liquidated my Entire capital....

Here are the main things I’ve learned about building strategies that actually survive:

1. **Start with real market logic** – momentum, mean reversion, trend trading. Don’t base it on random indicators or patterns without context. If there’s no logic behind why it should work, it won’t last.
2. **Define rules with zero subjectivity** – if you can’t code it into exact conditions, it’s not a real strategy. No “the market looks bullish.” Only measurable, rule-based setups.
3. **Backtest properly** – 10+ years of data across multiple pairs and environments. Short tests are misleading.
4. **Out-of-sample testing** – use untouched data to confirm the edge isn’t just curve-fitting.
5. **Robustness checks** – Monte Carlo simulations, parameter sensitivity, etc. If small changes destroy the results, it’s not stable.
6. **Forward test on demo** – confirm the system behaves in real markets before going live.

When a strategy goes through this process, it’s far more likely to stay profitable instead of collapsing after a few months.",3,12,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nnhg37/how_i_build_trading_strategies_that_remain/,new,Discussion,0.72

I’ve been running a rule-based commodity trading system (inspired by Turtle principles + my own execution rules), focused mainly on **Gold and Silver**. I track results rigorously using a *dynamic benchmark* — meaning I only count outperformance if my portfolio beats the **strongest benchmark (Nifty / Gold / Silver)** for that month. That way I measure true alpha, not just lucky comparisons.

Here’s the summary so far:

**Since Inception (Jul–Sep 2025)**

* **Portfolio PnL**: +62.78%
* **Best Benchmark (Silver, Jul–Sep)**: +22.15%
* **Outperformance vs Best Benchmark**: +40.63%

**Monthly Breakdown**

* **Jul ’25** → +10.84% (vs best benchmark +3.46%) → **+7.38% true alpha**
* **Aug ’25** → +15.39% (vs best benchmark +9.46%) → **+5.93% true alpha**
* **Sep ’25** → +36.56% (vs best benchmark +7.86%) → **+28.70% true alpha**

I’m documenting everything and open to sharing trade-level data for verification. My intention is clear: I’m not waiting for capital to come to me later — I want to be ready to present to people or desks who are willing to invest in a **proven system** now.

I have two versions of it (one for uptrends and one for downtrends), which are essentially the opposite of each other. I have a checklist that involves going through the weekly to 4-hourly timeframes, utilizing RSI, SMAs, MACD, and support/resistance areas. I have it written in third person as that helps make the rules clearer for me and stops me from reasoning as to when one can be slightly broken. I have also been testing it across the 7 main USD pairs to increase the likelihood of my setup appearing.

I'll paste it below, but just wanted some advice from those more experienced than me. cheers.

this is for the downtrend strategy:

**1.       Weekly**

·       On the weekly chart, confirm price is below the 50-SMA and 200-SMA, with 50-SMA below 200-SMA.

·       RSI < 50 to confirm bearish momentum.

 **2.       Daily Trend**

·       Ensure price remains below both 50-SMA and 200-SMA, with 50-SMA below 200-SMA (death cross).

·       Check that RSI < 50 and MACD line is below the signal line (bearish confirmation).

 **3.       Daily Rally**

·       On the daily chart, look for a temporary bounce toward the 50-SMA.

·       Ensure RSI rises to 50-60 (not overbought >70).

**4.       4-hour**

·       Look for price rejecting off the 50-SMA with a bearish candlestick and a MACD bearish crossover (MACD line crosses below signal line).

·       Ensure RSI is in the 50-60 range to avoid oversold entry.

·       Place SL above the recent swing high.

·       Set TP at the next support level or min. 2x SL distance for a 1:2 risk-reward ratio (if no clear support level).",1,3,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nnbcpq/dealing_with_no_setups/,new,Question,1.0

1nmx0to,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 12:50:01,5 Years In: The Advice I Wish Someone Gave Me On Day One,"I’ve been trading full-time for  2 years, started trading 5 years ago. Along the way, I’ve blown accounts, passed and lost prop firm challenges, had incredible months, and then been humbled the very next week. I primarily trade futures and stocks, but these lessons apply no matter what market you’re in.



1) Fewer Trades, Better Trades

My worst periods came from feeling like I needed to be in the market constantly. The reality is that most price action is just noise, or at least noise to YOU. The edge shows up only a handful of times each week. My best months came from taking fewer than 20 trades and letting the rest pass.



2) Keep Your Playbook Simple

When I started, my charts looked like Times Square, indicators stacked everywhere. That only led to hesitation and confusion. What finally worked was cutting it all down to a short, boring playbook: clean levels, liquidity cues, structure, and a couple of repeatable entries. Same markets, same times, same setups. Very very boring, which is good in the markets.



3) Risk First, Always

Every account I destroyed had the same cause: I ignored risk and moved stops, oversized or tried to “let it work.” Now I define my maximum loss per trade and per day. I place my stop where the trade is invalid and respect it. Capital is ammunition, you only get so much. Don’t waste it trying to prove you’re right. Also one of the reasons I could not make it in options trading is because yyou just never know the exact amount you can make.



4) Journaling Is Where Growth Happens

I used to think bad days were random. Journaling proved otherwise. When I started logging my trades with context, entry, exit, and emotions, patterns became obvious. I was revenge trading after losses, taking boredom trades late in the morning, and cutting winners during news. Writing it down forced me to face the truth and improve. I started with manual journaling but then moved to software years later because when you just write down stuff in your notebook, its really hard for the stats or the lessons you need to see to be availble to you quickly.



5) Protect Your Headspace

Trading money you can’t afford to lose is a fast way to ruin both your account and your mental health. If your rent or grocery money is on the line, you will cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and chase bad setups. Trade small, separate trading capital from living expenses, and make sure red days don’t control your mood for 24 hours.



6) Screen Time Beats Guru Time

Videos and books can teach you the basics, but real progress comes from watching price move in real time, replaying sessions, and backtesting your setups. Intuition isn’t luck, it’s thousands of hours of screen time.



7) Base Hits Beat Home Runs

Chasing the one big trade is what ruined me early on. Consistency is what built my account. A steady $200-300 a day compounds into far more than swinging for $5K and blowing up when you’re wrong. The small, repeatable wins are what keep you in the game long enough to scale. I started with making $20-40 a day or a trade I should say, and slowly sizing up, then gaining more capital and copy tading these smaller trades accross plenty accounts.



Bottom Line

Trading isn’t about finding a secret strategy. It’s about building a clear playbook, respecting risk, journaling your execution, and protecting your mindset. Once you do those things consistently, confidence stops being a feeling and becomes a fact backed by your data.



I’d like to continue doing write-ups like this if it helps the community. For my next post, I can go deeper into:



A) My exact journaling and review workflow (what I log, how I review, and how it’s helped me improve)

B) An autopsy of my first year, the 10 biggest mistakes I made and how I fixed each one

1nmwrsi,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 12:40:09,5 daily habits that move traders toward success,"Working with traders every day, I’ve noticed something interesting: the traders who eventually find consistency don’t always have the “flashiest” strategies, but they almost always build solid habits around their trading.

A few that stand out to me:

* **Sticking to risk limits** no matter what. It sounds basic, but it’s often the difference between blowing up and surviving long enough to grow.
* **Journaling trades** \- not just P/L, but documenting the *why* behind each entry and exit.
* **Routine** \- treating trading like a job, not a gamble. Having set hours, prepping before the session, and reviewing after.
* **Patience** \- waiting for high-quality setups instead of forcing trades.
* **Emotional control** \- being okay with losses, and not letting wins make you reckless.

From what I’ve seen, these habits tend to separate the traders who last from those who burn out quickly.

1nmsmso,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 09:56:16,Integrate day trade with job hunt? Looking for peers and advice,"**Purpose of this post**

I’m writing this post to have your view on my rationale and progress for day trading. I’m also looking for those who have a sustainable passion for day-trading, and ideally we can discuss strategies, share results, and even land a friendship. 

**Background**

* I’m a final-year student studying Finance and Machine Learning. My career interests are in asset management and markets, and I spend time every day reading news surrounding US commodity and equity markets. 
* Earlier this year, I finished my risk management internship at Macquarie (Australia’s well-known IB), but I didn’t receive a grad offer. Since then, I’ve been applying to pretty much every internship I can find related to asset management and markets. I managed to land a few interviews at Citi, GS, NAB, etc., but unfortunately didn’t get any offers.

I’m grateful that I managed to land a few interviews at prestigious firms, given Australia’s extremely saturated labor market. To give you an idea: NAB told us during the assessment centre that there were around 5,000 applications for their market internship role, and last year only 4 offers were given (you’d be surprised to find candidates at final stages that do not have 2+ internship experiences and equivalent to perfect GPA etc). Most mainstream internship applications are closed now, so I’ve started shifting my strategy to cold-emailing people on LinkedIn to see if there are any open spots.

**Rationale for Day Trading**

I have to say, the process of grinding through hundreds of online assessments, AI interviews, and waiting endlessly for outcomes is unhealthy. A few past colleagues and friends I catched up with agreed that it’s a fantasy to simply say and shift your mindset away when you’ve already invested hours or days into an application. The general consensus is that you find something intellectually challenging, so you’re not stuck worrying about things you can’t control. Some of my friends picked up swing trading or got serious about tennis, but for me, I wanted to know more about day trading.

**Why do I find myself suitable?**

* With application rounds near end and a reasonable coursework, I can consistently and currently put 3 hours purely for day-trading.
* I do not expect to put any capital until SIM proves consistent profits so there'd be no material losses on top of job rejections. My objective is to learn day trade as it's always been a huge interest for me.
* Although day-trading does not greatly depend on analyzing markets and company fundamentals, learning day trade provides great opportunity to learn the fundamental structure of a market and how orders, liquidity, volatility plays a role in influencing price actions. This is something that is intellectually challenging and aligns with my career interest.
* I personally don't think majors itself play a strong edge for day-trading but I've learnt to be patient, resilient and adaptive from my studies. At least I can claim that my majors have no negative impact for day trading.
* Yes I live in Sydney so market opens at 11:30 pm my time but I've managed to find a schedule that suits my life style.

**Current Progress**

I appreciate anyone who’s made it this far. The first thing I did when I started learning day trading was read *How to Day Trade for a Living* by Andrew Aziz, which really confirmed for me that consistency + passion > long hours + money-driven. Now I’m halfway through his second book, *Advanced Techniques for Day Trading*, and completed their lessons on psychology. I enjoy their live day trading sessions too, where you actually get to see how professional day traders (yes even Andrew himself) operate in real time and how they deal with psychological challenges in line with what’s written in their books, e.g., accepting losses like a chad.

I’ve also started using SIM on TradingView to get a feel for trade executions, and I’ve been journaling my trades and reflecting on them (attached a pic for reference). Right now, I’m committed to sticking with ONE or TWO strategies that I feel are most aligned with market logic and price action. I don’t really buy into fancy chart patterns (e.g. three white soldiers) that don’t have a solid root in market theory or psychology behavior but feel free to prove me wrong.

I’ve also attached a screenshot that shows my trade goals, how I define my trade book, and the rules I’m working with. They’re definitely still under progress, but feel free to take a look and drop any comments.

**Just one last bit**

Hopefully there’ll be some comments. I’ve purposely avoided going into too much detail to not bog people down. Instead, I’ll put more focus into building conversations with (all) comments and thus share more if necessary. If you'd just like to know more about me, just drop a comment and I’ll shoot you my LinkedIn pfp.

1nmquzi,2025-09-21,2025-09-21 08:38:11,The Future of Trading,"I believe we are in the midst of a significant paradigm shift in trading. I have been looking at more advanced trading strategies and I began researching Jim Simons.  He is one, if not the, most successful traders of all time.  He was years ahead of his time.  He trained scientists to trade and didn’t hire people from the financial community.  Same with Richard Dennis and Turtle traders. The point is, Simons hired the most brilliant minds in the world from meteorology to Applied Discrete Mathematics. Here is a summary of his work I asked AI to write. 

Jim Simons ran Renaissance’s Medallion as a data-driven, market-neutral, short-term statistical-arbitrage machine: clean huge datasets, find many tiny repeatable patterns with math and ML, trade across thousands of instruments, combine hundreds of small signals, hedge out broad market risk, size positions by expected edge and how they move together, cut losing signals fast, and crush costs and slippage with world-class execution. In that setup, trading—signal aggregation, portfolio construction, execution quality, and risk/cost control—mattered far more than classic stock selection; the specific names were mostly “carriers” for micro-patterns, while profits came from many small, fast, well-hedged bets executed with precision. 

He returned 66% annualized return over his career.  I began to reason we have access to this knowledge at our finger tips now with AI. Trading will change, whether we change with it or not.  If you consider we are on the front end, finally with traction in crypto, AI, quantum, the resurgence of nuclear, Robotics, etc., the future market looks like the beginning of a bull run which could run ahead of tech development and implementation. I think we are going to have to adjust and develop new metrics.  Jobs will be lost on the front end as jobs are developed to service and manage data centers, EV robotaxis, drones, nuclear facilities and more.  My point to all of this is, algos and HFT’s are already here.  Retail traders must find an edge.  This lies in not just learning the smoke and mirrors ICT program but, how to trade along side the institutions and compete.  Start thinking outside the box.  Constructive Thoughts?

You can consistently do the wrong thing every single day. That doesn’t make it profitable, it just makes you consistent.

The truth is if your system doesn’t have an edge, then all the discipline in the world won’t save you. Discipline only amplifies what’s already there. If you’ve got a negative expectancy, discipline just makes you bleed out slower and more reliably.

I see a lot of traders saying they just need to “lock in” or “be more consistent” and that’s why they’re losing. No. Most of the time the reason they’re losing is because the way they trade has no edge in the first place. You can be a consistent loser. In fact, most traders are.

Discipline matters, but it only matters after you actually have something worth being disciplined about. Otherwise you’re just marching in circles while the market takes your money.",30,38,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nmgobv/discipline_edge/,new,Discussion,0.82

I've noticed with respect to key levels (premarket high/low, yesterday high/low) I can sometimes see it lead SPY by a few 5min candles.

Background : I lost my job in February. Early 60s so I figured, rather than go back to the labor market, I'd transition to trading full time. And when people asked what I was going to do, I said. 

I started during covid, like many, so had been through the learning curve. But this year was, obviously, more intense and I'm finally pulling ahead in the black. 

So this friend, who is normally a wonderful person, a few weeks ago dropped a text bomb that they want me to come over to their house and help them pick a few stocks. Later I them I told them I couldn't, for the same reason I wouldn't tell them how to spend their money in any other situation, and they dropped it. 

Now, they're asking again. I just said to look at data.

1nm2lej,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 12:25:25,Here's a realistic breakdown of what it actually takes to become a consistent trader,"Ive noticed most people get into day trading because they see screenshots of $5k, $10k, $50k days and think it’s a quick path to freedom. I’ll be straight with you guys, that’s the marketing version of trading. Please don't buy into it. The reality is much less glamorous, and if you don’t know what it really takes, you’re going to burn out fast. After 5 years in this game, i wanted to do a little write up on my honest breakdown of what consistency actually looks like. This is Part 3 of my education series here, follow if you want more.

1. Time commitment is way more than you expect.

Trading isn’t just 9:30am to 4pm. Real consistency comes from hours outside market time: premarket prep, journaling, reviewing trades, building watchlists, studying setups, and putting in screen time. Early on, I easily spent 40 to 60 hours a week between live trading and studying. If you treat this like a hobby, you’ll get hobby-level results.

And it’s not just the hours, it’s the years. Consistency doesn’t come in 6 months, or even a year for most people. You’re rewiring how you think about money, risk, and decision-making under pressure. Expect it to take 2 or 3 years of real effort before you’re truly stable.

2. Risk management is non-negotiable.

I know everyone hears this, but most beginners still ignore it. Consistency doesn’t mean you never lose... it means your losses are small and controlled while your winners are slightly bigger. That balance, over hundreds of trades, is what keeps you profitable.

I don’t care if you’ve got the best setup in the world; if you’re risking half your account on one trade, you’re gambling. True consistency comes from risking small, living to fight another day, and never letting one trade or one day define you.

3. Discipline beats strategy.

Every new trader is obsessed with finding the “perfect” strategy. They’ll cycle through indicators, patterns, and systems, convinced the answer is out there somewhere. The truth? Most basic strategies work if you follow them with discipline. Most traders fail not because of their system, but because they don’t stick to it.

Consistency is boring. It’s showing up, following the same rules, and resisting the urge to deviate because of greed or fear. If you can’t execute a simple plan consistently, no “advanced” strategy will save you.

4. You need emotional resilience.

Day trading will mess with your head. You’re going to lose money. You’re going to question if you’re cut out for this. You’re going to watch your P/L swing in seconds and feel emotions you didn’t know you had. The people who survive aren’t the ones who avoid that... they’re the ones who learn to handle it.

Emotional resilience means not tying your identity to your results. It means accepting red days without revenge trading. It means staying calm when you’re up big and not blowing it all chasing more. Without that mental toughness, you’ll self-destruct.

5. You have to treat it like a business.

This isn’t a game. If you’re serious about consistency, you have to approach trading like running a business. That means budgeting your capital, keeping records, analyzing performance, and making adjustments based on data, not emotion. Your journal is your balance sheet. Your setups are your products. Your time and focus are your resources.

When you treat trading like a hobby, it costs you money. When you treat it like a business, it gives you structure and accountability. That shift in mindset is often the difference between gamblers and professionals.

**Bottom line**

Becoming a consistent trader isn’t flashy. It’s not about one big win, a secret indicator, or a magic system. It’s about boring, repetitive, disciplined work.. day after day, year after year. If you accept that reality, you’ll stop chasing shortcuts and actually give yourself a chance to make it.

1nly8v5,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 09:30:35,"5 years of trading, my best tips","I’ve been day trading full-time for about 5 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up accounts, had winning streaks, and gone through phases where I thought I finally “figured it out” only to get humbled the next week. If you’re just getting into this, I’ll save you a lot of pain by sharing the biggest lessons I wish someone drilled into me early on.

1. Risk management is everything.

This is the hill most beginners die on. It doesn’t matter how good your strategy looks, how many indicators you stack on your chart, or how many “conviction trades” you think you’ve found... if you don’t have strict risk rules, the market will clean you out. Always know your max risk per trade. For most people, that’s around 1–2% of your account balance. It sounds boring, but it’s the only thing that keeps you alive long enough to actually learn.

The temptation to “average down” or hold losers is massive when you’re new. You’ll convince yourself that a stock “has to bounce” or “can’t go any lower,” and then watch it tank another 10%. Every trader who’s lasted has their scars from ignoring stop losses. Treat capital like ammo; you only get so much of it, and wasting it on stubbornness will take you out of the game fast.

2. Don’t overtrade.

One of the biggest mistakes I see (and made myself) is thinking you need to be in a trade all the time. The reality is most of the market is just noise. The edge comes from waiting for the handful of clean setups each week that actually make sense. Some of my best months have come from taking fewer than 20 trades total.

It feels counterintuitive at first. You think, “If I’m not in a trade, I’m not making money.” But that’s backwards. By forcing trades, you’re just paying commissions, racking up losses, and burning mental energy. A huge skill in day trading is learning to sit on your hands until your setup appears. That patience is where consistency comes from.

3. Journaling changes the game.

I used to think journaling was pointless. Then I realized most of my losing trades weren’t about the strategy at all; they were about me. When you actually write down why you entered, why you exited, and what you were feeling at the time, patterns start to appear. You might notice you revenge trade after a loss, or that you take bad setups when you’re bored.

Your trading journal becomes your mirror. It forces you to face the truth instead of lying to yourself with hindsight. Over time, it’s less about “what did the chart do” and more about “why did I react this way.” That self-awareness is where growth happens, and without it, you’ll keep repeating the same mistakes.

4. Keep your setup simple.

When you’re new, you want to believe the answer is some secret indicator or complex strategy nobody else knows. So you start stacking indicators until your chart looks like Times Square. I went through that phase too. But after years of testing, I came back to the basics: clean price action, volume, and maybe one or two moving averages. That’s it.

The market isn’t hiding anything from you. Overcomplication just creates decision paralysis. The pros aren’t out here with 15 indicators... they’re reading levels, momentum, and supply/demand zones. Keep your charts clean, focus on setups you can repeat, and you’ll save yourself years of frustration.

5. Protect your mental health.

Trading will wreck you if you let it. If you’re risking rent money or grocery money, you’re trading scared, and scared traders make terrible decisions. You’ll cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and constantly feel like your back’s against the wall. That’s not trading, that’s gambling under pressure.

Detach yourself from the outcome of any single trade. This is easier said than done, but the only way to do it is by trading money you can afford to lose and keeping size small until you’re consistent. If a red day ruins your mood for 24 hours, you’re too emotionally tied to your positions. Protect your headspace first; the money follows when you’re calm.

6. Learn from screen time, not YouTube gurus.

There’s a ton of content online, but no video or course will replace actually watching the market tick by tick. You need screen time to understand how price moves, how news impacts volatility, and how momentum builds and fades. That “intuition” you see in experienced traders doesn’t come from books, it comes from thousands of hours watching patterns unfold live.

Don’t get me wrong, you can pick up useful basics from videos. But the real learning happens when you put skin in the game, track your trades, and experience the emotions firsthand. Nobody can teach you how you react to fear and greed, that’s something only screen time reveals.

7. Consistency > home runs.

The biggest misconception beginners have is thinking they need a massive trade to “make it.” They see screenshots of 10k days on Twitter and start chasing jackpots. The truth is, most accounts blow up because people swing for the fences. Survival in this game comes from small, consistent wins while keeping losses tiny.

A steady $100 a day, compounded, crushes the guy who tries to make $1,000 in one shot and wipes half his account. The math is simple, but the ego makes it hard to follow. Focus on consistency, build confidence, and scale later. Day trading is a marathon of small edges, not a lottery ticket.

Bottom line.

Day trading isn’t easy. Most people fail not because they can’t read charts, but because they underestimate how much discipline, patience, and emotional control it really takes. If you treat this like a craft instead of a get-rich-quick scheme, you’ll give yourself a real shot.

I really like this community so plan on doing more write-ups like these as a mini education series. If you guys want, my next one can be about

A) The biggest mistakes I made in my first year of day trading (so you don’t have to)

B) What a ‘normal’ day actually looks like as a full-time day trader

C) Why 90% of traders quit in under 2 years (and how not to be one of them)

1nlxryy,2025-09-20,2025-09-20 09:09:38,Dropping Construction for Trading—Need Advice and Perspective,"Hey everyone, I just got into trading and I have to say, it’s fucking exciting. I love how, once you learn the basics, it’s all about predicting where the price action is heading based on probability — which I find really cool. The more I get into it, the more I want to leave my crane internship and my mentor behind to focus full-time on trading. 

My construction job varies week to week—sometimes I work 80 hours, other times only 40, but usually it’s between 40 and 80 hours. I’ve been at this job for almost six months now. Honestly, I don’t even love the construction work; I kind of hate it. It’s exhausting, and I just feel like I could be doing something more fulfilling, like trading at home because it’s fun.

I also have about $7,000 saved up, which I think could give me some room to learn and grow as a trader without risking everything right away. I’m considering going back to serving and studying full-time, like I did before I got into construction, since my schedule makes it tough to trade in the mornings when I work. I don’t have debt, but my dad struggles with alcohol dependence and depression, which is really tough emotionally. Sometimes I worry he might pass away suddenly, and that scares me. On the other hand, I feel like I should’ve done more to help him, and that’s been weighing on me.

My crane mentor really supports me and keeps saying I’ll be a great crane operator. I think it’s mostly because he appreciates my go-getter attitude and work ethic, but honestly, can all that hard work not go into trading instead? I’m only 21, but I can’t shake the feeling that I could’ve done more with my life. I don’t even really know why I got into construction in the first place—maybe I thought it was the safe or expected thing, but my real passion is trading.

I want to build a life trading because that’s what excites me, not construction or crane work. I just want to figure out how to focus on trading, make a living from it, and maybe take more control over my life without stressing myself out.

3 months ago, I started trading with some of my pocket money (m, 19). To be honest I eyeballed it with the chosen stocks ( invested in companies I knew as Micron, Nvidia, TSMC, etc, general speaking into the tech). I mostly putted my money in Micron (250€) and bought ½shares of other companies here and there. It somehow paid out and I earned myself nearly 100€ but due to the german tax system they got 25€, which I can recover but still annoying. 

I want to know how to trade with strategies and do some minor analysis on my own. I followed the news daily and kept eye on the companies
Basically, I really liked trading ( unfortunately, only as a hobby for the foreseeable future, As soon as I get a degree and earn money, i would consider making bigger investments) would like to know how and where I can learn how to trade and make educated guesses and do research on my own.

How often should I be checking up on the overall performance of the stock? For example, Invested in a quantum stock 2 days ago, was already up 7% and sold for profit. I'm not afraid of taxes as long as I'm making profit and reinvesting in other companies that are moving fast.

Should I be checking them everyday, every week? I know trends move and money flows... I've been keeping tight numbers of whats doing good etc... I have long term investments and short term, but the short term is what I want to be watching.

Saw a post somewhere that said 15% profit on stocks are a good exit? Obviously doing this comes risk of missing a potential runner like (PLTR,NVDA) if I were to find that startup company early and selling for a short gain.

You own a portfolio except every stock is a creature to collect! Also integrated AI-features so it’ll recommend you stocks, long/short advice, app progression advice, as well as portfolio preferences!","Hi! I wanted to combine my interest in finance, art, and app dev, so I came up with a different type of stock market simulator, where you learn about investing by collecting creatures!

You can enter real stock tickers and decide whether to long/short, and each stock will represent either a bull (long) or bear (short).

Speaking from personal experience, I believe financial literacy and an early understanding of markets can be incredibly valuable for students as they prepare for the future. My prototype still needs a lot of refining, so I would appreciate any feedback!

Here’s the app's core mechanic: you make real stock price predictions. If you think a stock will go up (i.e. “long” a stock), you hatch a bull; if you think it’ll go down (i.e., “short” a stock), you hatch a bear. If your prediction is wrong, your creature loses health, but you can use potions to heal it. Each potion teaches a basic investing concept, like how earnings reports or interest rates affect prices, while improving your creature’s stats. You can also level up for evolution. It’s kind of like Duolingo meets Tamagotchi, but for the stock market.

I’ve noticed I have a really bad habit when trading: as soon as a position starts going my way, I move my stop to breakeven almost immediately. I think it comes from fear of being negative or just wanting to “protect” myself, but the problem is most of the time the trade eventually hits my TP — I just get stopped out at breakeven before it gets there.

I’m trying to break out of this habit, but it feels more psychological than technical. Any advice, tips, or mindset shifts that helped you deal with this would be really appreciated.

1nl59h3,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 10:35:15,Proving Daytrading Any Cryptocurrency is Possible!,"It took a really long time to find a strategy that works without making any personal analysis - just the indicators doing the work for you. I created customized indicators that mixes volume, statistics (i.e., kernel density estimation, etc), and conventional technical analysis equipment (i.e., fibonacci retracement, customized volume profile).

**Abstract**

I conducted a series of manual trades operating between August and September (\~2 months). I decided with 200 trades to create a robust sample size for reliability.

Listed on BINANCE, 26 cryptocurrencies were selected as part of the 200 trades via simple random sampling, with some stratification variability.

* SHELLUSDT.P, STRKUSDT.P, NOTUSDT.P, MYROUSDT.P, BRETTUSDT.P, MOODENGUSDT.P, DEGENUSDT.P, SPELLUSDT.P, BIGTIMEUSDT.P, PIPPINUSDT.P, ACHUSDT.P, OPUSDT.P, KAVAUSDT.P, GALAUSDT.P, DOGSUSDT.P, TRUMPUSDT.P, WUSDT.P, VETUSDT.P, TURBOUSDT.P, AAVEUSDT.P, ROSEUSDT.P, PENGUUSDT.P, REZUSDT.P, DOGEUSDT.P, XRPUSDT.P, and ENAUSDT.P

I started with $100.00 as my initial capital.

* RRR = 1:1
* Leverage: 5x
* Commission fees accounted for

Null hypothesis: The true win-rate is equal to random chance; = 0.50.

Alternative hypothesis: The true win-rate is greater than random chance; > 0.50.

**Results**

* Win-rate: 65.5% in 200 trades (Risk-to-reward ratio = 1:1)
* Net profit: +1552% (i.e., $100.00 -> $1552.41)

**Conclusion**

Test for statistical significance: one-sample proportion z-test

Level of significance: 5%

p-value ≈ 5.82 × 10⁻⁶

Interpretation: We reject the null hypothesis. The strategy's observed win-rate is statistically significantly higher than 50% at conventional significance levels (p = 0.00000582, 95% CI (0.587, 0.717)).

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok so now the abstract is done (just know that my results are not random). Below presents several charts that highlight interesting visuals.

Figure 1: Observed cumulative win-rate progression

Figure 5: Stratified per-symbol win-rate (bootstrapped)

[This one is interesting. It is important to note that ENAUSDT.P is only a sample size of 1, which happened to be a loss.](https://preview.redd.it/m9sp8bk8u4qf1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=db6aa7e197cf6f69c388068fd53941c266669373)

**Limitations**

This strategy was done by manual backtesting. Although objectivity was attempted to be maintained at all costs, they may still be possibility of potential losses that were missed during the backtesting period. However, this is unlikely due to the statistically significant result as shown by the p-value.

**My notes**

I kinda wanted to do this for a while and share to the community that daytrading any cryptocurrency and succeeding (without doing any personal analysis) is possible. It just takes a LOT of time. I am also incredibly surprised the effectiveness of fibonacci and volume profile, but according to my testing, it's not very significant. However, they do boost win rate a little bit.

In the first two months, I absorbed a lot of content, survived the “gambling mode,” and studied the basics (TJR Bootcamp — and please, don’t start saying it’s not good; it helped me understand the fundamentals). Along with TJR and other traders like Kevin Furest and Trader Nocturno, I built a strategy. It’s not entirely mine — it’s more a mix of their points of view.

After that, I spent a month “trading” on TradingView, just setting my entries, SL, and TP. I took 5 trades on XAUUSD that month and won 4 out of 5, making a 7% profit with a 1:2 RR between 9–12 a.m. I knew it wasn’t enough, but I decided to open a demo account on MetaTrader.

August and the first half of September were tough: FOMO, overtrading, seeing trades that weren’t there… losing 7% in a row. Feeling lost, with pressure in my chest, I went back to my philosophy — Stoicism.

After an entire afternoon thinking, meditating, and reviewing my entries from August and September (I keep a journal), I realized I wasn’t sticking to my plan. This month, I’m making sure not to skip my plan. But here’s the thing: I feel like I’m missing something — that little piece that will make everything click in my mind.

When you first started trading, how long did it take before you stopped bleeding your account? How long until you were at least breaking even? And then, how much longer until you were consistently profitable?

I get that everyone’s timeline is different, some blow up multiple accounts before it clicks, others seem to stabilize faster. But I think hearing real experiences (the good and the bad) could be super useful for people like me who are trying to set realistic expectations.

Did something specific shift for you (like journaling, risk management, focusing on fewer setups), or was it just screen time and experience stacking up?

Would love to hear your stories.

1nkxqhb,2025-09-19,2025-09-19 04:11:13,Why News Trading Can Be Risky for Beginners,"
News trading can look exciting — sharp market moves, fast profits, and high energy. But for beginners, it often turns into unnecessary risk. Major news events (like NFP, CPI, or rate decisions) cause sudden spikes in volatility. Prices can move unpredictably, spreads widen, and slippage can eat into trades instantly.

Without experience, it’s easy to get caught on the wrong side of these moves, turning what seemed like a golden opportunity into a big loss. That’s why most new traders are better off mastering technical setups, risk management, and discipline before stepping into news-driven markets.

    •How do you guys practice when you’re just starting out?
    •Should I focus on one specific market (like Forex, crypto, or stocks) or explore multiple at first?
    •How do I track whether I’m improving or just getting lucky on a few trades?
    •Any tips for combining Fibonacci with candlestick patterns more effectively?

1nkt7bl,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 23:45:39,How backtesting changed everything for me.,"I want to share something I wish I understood way earlier in my trading journey: backtesting isn’t about finding the holy grail. It’s about gaining the confidence that your edge actually works and learning to trust it even when the market throws noise at you.

https://preview.redd.it/njy0vhrcm1qf1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee5b3f09ffeaa51aa20dc6782a6f5fdf7d595a7a

Over the last couple of months, I went all-in on backtesting my strategy. Here are my raw stats:



76 trades logged



Net P&L: $45,622.81



Trade win rate: 69.44%



Session win rate: 100% (8/8 sessions green)



Profit factor: 5.31



Trade expectancy: $634



Max drawdown: -$2,912



Average win vs loss: $1,120 vs -$481

https://preview.redd.it/8c15cetdm1qf1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=b710594127dac65dd936103e55e6bf50fb6e4c8d

The equity curve says it all, steady growth, small drawdowns (except one which is normal)  and compounding confidence.



What I Learned from Backtesting



The truth about “high win rate” strategies

Most strategies with 80-90% win rates look good short-term, but collapse once volatility shifts. I learned it’s not about being right every time, it’s about being consistent and protecting downside. My 40-70% win rate worked because my average win was more than double my average loss.



Drawdowns are inevitable

Even in a $45K stretch, I still faced a -$2,900 drawdown. Most traders quit at this point, thinking their strategy is broken. Backtesting taught me that drawdowns aren’t failure, they’re the cost of doing business.



20-30% annual returns are the sweet spot

The dream of doubling your account every year is usually what kills traders. But with backtesting, I saw firsthand that 20-30% annual returns, paired with prop firm capital, is enough to change your life. It’s not flashy, but it’s sustainable.



Confidence comes from data

When you’ve seen your setup play out across months of data, you stop second-guessing yourself in live trading. You stop jumping between strategies. You stop thinking every red day means you’re “broken.” 

I understand that live trading is definitly not the same as backtesting but any supplement of confidence can make a massive difference wehen you hit the markets and can help you preserve your money.



https://preview.redd.it/kap96iqfm1qf1.png?width=1702&format=png&auto=webp&s=7692d735092de28ce0c4199b5b8ce0896ee4c44c

Why Backtesting Changed My Mindset



Before, I’d take a couple of live trades, lose, and assume my edge was gone. I’d switch indicators, try a new YouTube setup, or even buy a course, lord knows I got scammed on so many courses, and some usefuul but just did not resonate with me.



Now, I know that my strategy has a proven expectancy. I know what my win rate is, I know what my drawdowns look like, and I know what kind of return I can expect if I stick with it. That kind of conviction is what separates traders who last from traders who blow up.



Backtesting also made me realize how much time I was wasting in Excel. Logging every trade manually, trying to track profits/losses, drawdowns, win rates… it became a headache. 



Final Thoughts



If you’re serious about trading, backtest your strategy. Not one weekend, not just 20 trades, do it for months. Track everything. Look at expectancy, drawdowns, and long-term performance.

If you want a plan, do it for a full 3months, every single day, go through bullish and bearish marlet cycles, see what ticker or if futures/forex works best for you.



There’s no holy grail strategy. But there is a holy grail process:



Build a simple edge.



Backtest it.



Refine it.



Gain confidence in it.



Then execute it in real-time with discipline.



I’ll leave you with this: your confidence as a trader will never come from watching someone else’s chart, it comes from seeing your own edge play out over and over again.



Now I’m curious:

For those of you who’ve backtested your own setups, what was the biggest realization you had?

1nklchw,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 17:44:20,From Nothing to Profitable: My Grounded Approach to Trading Strategy Design,"Look, most active traders don’t fail because they’re lazy - they fail because they overfit, build strategies backwards &/or never collect enough data.

I’ve been there - chasing systems and setups that didn’t make logical sense or didn’t fit my schedule.

Eventually I stopped following bs noise and started building from nothing the way systems should be built.

I'm going to try to break this down step by step - not just the rules, but how I’d think if I were starting from next to zero trading experience. Regardless if you are Mechanical or Discretionary this guide is designed to help you find your edge.

Let’s say I’ve just decided to become a trader. I know nothing. I just have the will. Here’s what I’d do. For those who’ve seen **Version 1 (Now deleted) search \[4\] to see key changes. Thank you!**

**Citations are visible at the bottom for context if desired**

# #1 I'd feel and adjust to my constraints first

**You start with what is possible for you, personally. That immediately rules out half the noise.**

* Time of day you can realistically trade (not **idealized** \- **realistically**)
* Knowing in advance if you need to sleep or work through certain sessions & what that means for your trading execution
* Do you want to hold trades overnight or not & is it compatible with your system (yes or no, on a strategy-by-strategy basis)
* How much capital will you trade with (eventually)?

**Why? Because all rule-building happens within constraints.**  
If you work a day job and trade 5m charts, you’re probably not able to trade the New York session. If you only trade during London session, you don’t build rules around Asian session. It really depends on time zones and other factors. Higher timeframes like hourly allow for higher versatility.

Ignoring constraints is why a lot of retail traders go nowhere – they copy others without aligning their system with their actual life. If you're ""trading here and there""/""when I can trade, I do X,"" it's adding noise to your results. The more variance in consistency, the worse it is for your bottom line.

# Pick One Market & Timeframe

**You don’t experiment with everything. Pick one instrument and one timeframe.**

For example: Dow Jones, hourly chart

**Why? Because markets behave differently.** Trying to make a system that works on Nasdaq, Gold, EURUSD, and Dow Jones at once is usually unwise. You will overfit or your strategy will break.

**One market. One behaviour set/trade setup.** If you want to run multiple instruments or setups/systems, split the risk amongst them. Each one should be good enough to isolate the risk and perform on its own.

**You must understand how your chosen market behaves. \[3\] & \[5\]**  
**Mean reverting, Alternating/Near Random Walk or Trending**

**Examples**  
Mean reverting: Dow Jones/YM, EURUSD  
Alternating/Near Random Walk: S&P 500/ES  
Trending: Nasdaq/NQ

You can do research to know which is which but if you want in-depth you can ask AI to use Hurst Exponent & Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test over market data.

Or if you're into programming you can get python script to do it. ADF Visuals + Hurst Exponential Chart Example

# Start Building with Logic, Not Results

To clarify, when you're learning, it's okay to look at charts for a while to familiarise yourself with how they look and what the candlesticks show.

The key is to avoid falling into the trap of confirmation bias. **You should write down an idea first, then test it.** **Do not change your rules as you go along.** And most importantly!

**Never go searching through charts to find ideas to test.**

**Start at the drawing board not the candlesticks.**  
Forget indicators. Forget entries. First you need structure. Here's what to make rules about:

**1. Trade Time Window**  
Define which hours are “valid” for entering trades, based on when your chosen market has high volume.  
**Example:** 8am to 4pm NY time for US indices.

**Why?** Because you need volatility to reach targets & volume at your entries for price to trend in your favour regardless of your system style (reversals, mean reversion or trend trading).

**Ex. Rule:**  
“I only take trades between 3pm and 9pm UK time.”

You can mark this with a sessions indicator (e.g. ""Sessions on Chart"" on TradingView, 10:00 to 16:00 setting).

# Risk Management

**Decide what you’re risking per trade.** Fixed % (e.g., 3% of account).  
In a live environment this value can be based on risk tolerance. It must be a logical value that fits within your goals, limits and needs. Your risk needs to be planned ahead, and stuck to. Your risk can be static or dynamic.

**For prop firms, you must calculate your risk to fall in line with the maximum drawdown rules.**

The Amount risked has to be calculated with maximum drawdown & maximum daily drawdown in heavy consideration.

For example, someone may have a system with a loss equivalent to 10 losses in a row -10R maximum in testing his prop firm allows up to 10% maximum drawdown so he decides to trade 0.6% per trade allowing him to have space for that maximum peak to trough drawdown + 50% extra.

**Dynamic example:**  
More Aggressive traders may opt in for back tested rules to increase risk when holding on profitable running positions ex. Entering another position on another rejection (scaling in) or having pre-defined plans to increase risk during winning or losing periods in live environments depending on their risk tolerance & goals.

**Decide what your target-to-stop-loss ratio is before testing the system and stick with it (e.g., RRR: 2:1, 5:1, etc.).**

Don't adjust this to get better trading performance - **pick it based on logic, not data.**

Ex. Rule: “I aim for 4-5R on all reversal trades"" &/or ""3-4R on continuation trades.”

**If the system doesn't work, I throw it out.**

**Added Annotation for clarity: Find \[1\] At end of doc**

# Entry Style (Define Setup Type)

**Bar Replay backtest only.** Never scroll backward to ‘check’ the setup again.

**Pick something linear and logical.**  
Mean reversion? Reversals? Continuations? Breakouts?

Then ask: **What does that look like?**  
Do I want price to hit a level and reject (reversal)?  
Do I want price to push through and pull back (breakout/continuation)?  
**And why would it work?** What does my setup signify via **order flow mechanics**? **\[5\]**

**Order flow isn’t a system or strategy like educators teach.**  
**It’s the basics of how markets move on a tick-by-tick basis.**

**Basic Example explanation:** 

If there's a buyer at $10,000.25 who wants 100 units, but only 80 are available, price moves up one tick to $10,000.5 to fill the rest.

**Ex. 10000.5 50 available 10000.25 80 available**

He gets **80 filled at 10000.25 and 20 (the rest) at 10000.5**

(10000.25\*(80/100))+(10000.5\*(20/100)) = **10000.3 average**

price fill -> price increased to **10000.5**

# This is liquidity.

The only reason price moves is that there’s an imbalance between buy and sell volume. Nothing else

**That's why markets have a highly random nature. Example at Bonus 2**

Tick = minimum price movement on an instrument.

**Example purposes only: 3-wick reversal**

https://preview.redd.it/vbdtsa8hvzpf1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=810d0b202468627ca8a9a7640688943a260c6d5c

**3 Wick Entry Rule example purposes only:**  
“I place limit orders at the beginning wick of a 2-wick consecutive rejection if it forms and closes during my valid trading hours.”  
3 – Sell Limit Filled, Limit order pulled/expired if no fill on **bar 3**

https://reddit.com/link/1nklchw/video/4tg691xnvzpf1/player

**Short example using Order Flow Mechanics Knowledge \[5\]:**  
A wick high in a candle is rejected by the next candle and it closes. Sellers were present at that wick. Regardless of how the ""Order flow"" had taken place it is **irrefutable**.

If price revisits that price or higher and fails again, closing, I want to sell at that price - expecting a third rejection.

**Sell limit order fill, Bracketed with SL & TP (values known before the close)**

Vice versa for long setups.

**Most people who overcomplicate with “smart money” or “institutional”. Talk are waffling.**

# “If you are using charts to execute, you aren't smart money but you don't have to be dumb money either.”

**Dismiss educator narratives on why their methods supposedly work and use critical thinking applying Order flow mechanic basics to accept or dismiss trading entry ideas.**

Don't sleep walk into the ""institutional"" narrative fallacy’s educators sell you. Think about why price moves on a tick by tick basis and what the candlesticks you're basing your entry off actually indicate.

**Markets aren't ruled by patterns they're ruled by imbalances that's what fuels trends. Without an imbalance price won't move.**

If a setup doesn’t have logic like this backing up why it would succeed enough for it to be profitable besides randomness, you’re wasting your time.

# If your only answer to “why does it work?” is “my backtest says so,” you’re doomed

**I’ve asked a trader why he believes his system works besides his data and silence followed for minutes whilst he tried thinking of what to say. I shown him random OHLC candlesticks with his strategy applied and he thrown in the towel. Don’t be like this.**

https://reddit.com/link/1nklchw/video/t1tvferkvzpf1/player

**Examples of what not to base your system on:**

* Pivot points
* Fibonacci (**Based on faith and crowding**)
* MA bounces (**Random and seen on many data sets** ) Shown on Bonus 2 Fig.
* Complex multi-timeframe analysis (**Hard to quantify and bar replay backtest honestly without hindsight fogging vision**)
* Most **well known** indicators for entries

These methods are 1000% random with weak foundations or are purposefully hard to test accurately and honestly without overfitting. **Educators push it for plausible deniability when systems don’t perform. A model is hard to hold to account if there’s 1000 ways to trade it. The use of Multi time frame analysis in trading is fine as long as it’s not convoluted, has clear rules and is tested properly.**

# Target & Stop Loss Placement

**Targets must be placed consistently.**  
Targets are typically less important than entries and stops – but still important.

If using price structures (e.g. support/resistance), **define the logic first**, then the rules.

Ex. Someone could use swing highs/lows, support/resistance,

clustered wicks or rejection zones. **With fixed rules to define and mark them in advance.**

Price will naturally attract volume at these levels, **even if the instrument's order book volume doesn't reflect it in real time**. Ghost limit orders exist, pending stop orders & order fill algorithm triggers from **countless market participants for different reasons** it doesn't matter what happens when price interacts with these places it's just more often than not that they are **liquid areas**.

**Avoid fixed-distance targets - market volatility is dynamic.**

For example, a ""100 point fixed target"" or a ""20 point fixed stop"" is arbitrary and is not going to work if volatility shifts.

It is better to use dynamic yet consistent targeting methods. A trader must define fixed rules for regarding what is S/R and what is not.

So a dynamic targeting method ex. at defined highs or lows would be that for one trade it is 110 points, the second being 160 points, and the next is 140 points (all placed at predefined levels).

**Fixed targets overfit strategies easily.**

Your **execution costs** must be factored into your system.

Ex. 

If you use a 1:5 RR and a 100-pt target minimum, your minimum stop is 20 pts. 

If your max spread on your CFD is \~2pts, that’s 10% cost per trade - before everything else which matters.

Ex Rule: 

“Target is always ≥100 points for Dow. Stop is one-fifth of target.” - Why? Because it keeps costs at a modest level.

# Instrument-Specific Rules

**Some markets behave uniquely. You don’t need deep stats – just basic experience.**

* Nasdaq trends
* Dow mean reverts
* S&P 500 alternates. (Trending but Near random walk)
* Gold is erratic

Example: If you want mean reversion or early trend entries, Dow is a better choice than Nasdaq.

**Entry Model Influence Example:**  
**Example 1:** If you want mean reversion or early trend entries, Dow is a better choice than Nasdaq. (It’s more probable for Dow reverse intraday)  
**Example 2:** If you want to press trades or let positions run, Nasdaq is a better choice than Dow. (Trends are more pronounced on Nasdaq compared to Dow intraday)  
Either can have a trend or mean reversion model, but different strategies will tend to work better if aligned with the instrument’s nature.

**Strategy Risk Management Setup Influence Examples:**  
**Example 1:** If you have a strategy idea that includes rules to manually trail your stop loss in profit or uses large targets relative to stop size, Nasdaq would likely be a better choice compared to Dow. (Nasdaq trends more intraday which compliments this idea; Dow tends to mean revert/snap back, reducing the potential for home run trades.)  
**Example 2:** If you have a mean reversion strategy idea with a hard take profit and stop loss as risk management (most common), the Dow would likely be a better choice, as its intraday trends are less pronounced compared to the Nasdaq.

 

**Either market can have a trend and/or mean reversion model**, but different entry and risk management strategies will tend to work better if aligned with the instrument’s nature;

# These guidelines are of course not absolutes.

**Trending = Larger price extensions**, **Mean reversion = Higher likelihood of returning to the average price.**

**ADF & Hurst isn’t supposed to be used in real time it’s supposed to be used once to define an instrument and save time testing. Don’t forget that.**

# Start from Blank Charts

Instead of top-down start bottom up.

People look at charts for ideas when you need to **consult logic for inspiration**; **not recency biases from recent price action**. **Added Annotation for clarity: Find \[2\] At end of doc**

Back testing is there to put an idea to the test.

**Before building rules based on the chart, define a hypothesis.**

**Example:** 

**“What if I traded Dow Jones reversals using 3-wick setups with a 5R limit entry?”**

Then test this visually. On charts

**You’re not trying to make it “fit,” but to ask:**

*- Does this work during valid hours?* 

*- Does the visual match my logic?* 

*- Does the reaction make sense knowing Order flow’s nature?* 

*- Would my setup realistically hit target often enough to net a profit over time?*

**Only then write rules to test.**

# Write Rules as If You’re Giving Them to a Machine

**Your rules must be:**

* **Objective**
* **Actionable**
* **Not open to interpretation**
* **Modest costs ideally <20% Don’t let it exceed 30% of your expected R or your edge collapses (Exponential costs)** ex. If you risk $100 and your RR is 5:1 but after adding spread, comms and other costs like slippage it’s >3.5R / >70% of R realised minimum>$350 minimum on each 5R setup

**Bad Rule:**  
“If the market is ranging, I don’t trade.” **(No definition for range or how to identify it)**

**Good Rule:**  
“If a 3-wick setup forms between 3–9pm UK time, and the high/low of setup is beyond/below \[X filter\], place sell limit at top wick or buy limit at low wick.” **(Rule based intuition/discretion free)**

**Define everything clearly** \- the filter, logic, conditions, etc.

# Stress Test the System by Breaking It

**Once rules are written, test them brutally.** 

Ask:

\- Is this rule based on **logic** or **emotional comfort?** **Be emotionally detached**

  (ex. Breakeven or partial profits reduce strategy net profit - so why use them?)\*

Partials or Breakeven reduce strategy expectancy more often than not\*

\- Does it work over 3+ months of data? (Depending on timeframe)

1R = 1 unit of risk ex. 3%

Log the data, process it -1R+4R-1R-1R+4R

# - What if market conditions flip? (Test on conditions against the system's nature)

Test mean reversion and reversal systems on trending weeks & if you're trading trend trading systems test them on mean reverting/ranging weeks. See your system struggle. Example (Surface Level)

Date Example August 8**^(th)** to September 13**^(th)** **2024 on mean reversion systems for YM/Dow Jones is a good place to stress test due to the relentless intraday trends exhibited.**

**- What if trading costs rise 20%? (Reduce size of profits by \~20%)**

\- after the initial rejection candle close if there is an additional rejection should I scale in/increase the risk on the trade (Entry 2 typically has higher win rate vs Entry 1 when scaling in for my systems\*\*) testing will confirm whether it's worth doing\*\*. **To scale in or not to scale in**

Scaling in is only worth doing is the win rate if Entry 2 is superior to that of Entry 1 ex. 45% winrate Entry 2 vs 40% winrate (main entries) most systems don't benefit largely from it so **be careful.**

**Entry = Individual Trade Execution (filled with 1R risk per trade ex, 3%) 2 Entries = 3% \* 2 = 6% for example.**

**- Should I hedge or wait until my position is closed to enter setups on the opposite direction?**

**-Is it worth holding overnight?**

**-Do I have enough leverage/margin to trade this strategy on my broker or prop firm of choice (find out the leverage needed maximum per trade with stop distance % relative to % risk per trade desired)**

# You're not seeking perfection, but robustness. 

**If a small change breaks your system - it’s overfit noise.**

# Bonus: When in Doubt, Zoom Out

**Ask: Does this decision happen every trade?**  
If yes, write a rule. If not, STOP, think, and evaluate the logic.

**You should:**

* **Know your risk % – make a rule**
* **Know your stop – make a rule**
* **Aim to know target, stop, and entry price(s) before the candle closes  (Bracketed limit orders help a lot.)**

# Bonus 2: Market Randomness

**I’m not saying the market is efficient, I’m saying it’s very close so you need to be refined in your approach. It’s not a choice**

# Added Annotations [4]:

**\[1\] The specific ratios don't matter. You shouldn't be curve fitting/overfitting your system (trying to find the best ratio)**

Elaboration:

The logic in the example behind using 3-4R in continuation trades is that you should allow for larger movements against your entry because you're entering in the middle of a trend. For example, when trend following, if you're buying, you are executing at premium prices, not at discount prices. more space for error is required.

And 4-5 Ratio for example is encouraging tighter stop losses relative to target for Reversals because you're actively going against the trend.

The ratios given were example ratios you can change them based on your ideas.

**\[2\] When I mean consult logic, I meant order flow mechanics \[3\] which I mention in the document primarily but it's also about rejecting ideas like MA Bounces and Fibonacci which aren't logical reasons to engage with the markets.**

Wick high = selling pressure

Wick low = buying pressure

Body = sustained buying or selling within the time slot on the data series/chart

Use this knowledge to create your own ideas for logical trade entry systems to test

**\[3\] ADF & Hurst Exponent Overview**

ADF shows you if a data series/chart reverts to it’s mean (average price)

Hurst tells you if a data series/chart trends, reverts or leans towards a random walk. Helps decide trending market vs mean reverting market.

**1. ADF Test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller)**

What it ADF tells you in practice:

ADF checks whether a time series is mean-reverting i.e., do things tend to wander off indefinitely, or does it tend to return to some average value over time elapsed.

If the ADF test is “significant” (p-value < 0.05):

The series does revert to a mean.

When a time series ex a candlestick chart is mean reverting imagine price is like a stretched rubber band when it moves away from the average, it tends to snap back/reverse.

If it's not significant (p-value > 0.05):

The series is likely a random walk, drifting unpredictably without any sort of central anchor.

2. Hurst Exponent

What Hurst tells you in practice:

It quantifies how “trendy” or “mean-reverting” a time series is.

H ≈ 0.5 The chart/time series is random noise; random walk/Brownian motion.

H < 0.5 → The chart is mean-reverting tends to snap back.

H > 0.5 → The chart has momentum tends to have extensions/continuation in the same direction i.e trend.

**Key Changes in Version 2 \[4\]:**

Many small tweaks for clarity, added important clarifications especially on Step 7, included annotations for context, and I’ve provided definitions to support beginners.

The model hasn’t changed it’s just explained better. Changes were based on trader insights and needs. Thanks for the feedback. I Appreciate it – Ron.

# TL;DR & Summary:

**Structure before everything.**  
**Logic before data.**  
**Consistency before optimization.**  
Logic → Rules → Data → Optimisation **(Based on ideas, not data or it’s curve fitting)“Why” before “What.”**

**Every rule is based on:**

1. **What you can realistically do**
2. **What the market allows** (ex scalping CFDs is usually not a viable strategy due to higher or exaggerated costs on higher lot sizes) 
3. **What gives clear, repeatable decisions**

**You don’t optimize to improve win rate or net gain.**  
You optimize to enhance the logic behind the system – which often translates to improved performance (net gain)

Yes – the first 0–20 hours (first few testing sessions) will feel foggy. Then it clicks.  
You’ll never know if it works until you test it exactly as written.  
That’s when the market becomes your teacher.

If a system implodes/stops working it doesn't mean a different variation of it can't work again in the future.

1nkkj55,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 17:12:05,20 years of trading: my biggest mistakes & lessons,"I’ve been trading for about 20 years now, and looking back, most of my setbacks weren’t about having the “wrong” strategy, honestly, they were just about my own behavior (as hard as that is to admit).

The two biggest mistakes I made early on:

1. **Selling winners too early.** I can’t count the times I sold stocks like Meta or Nvidia after a quick 2x, only to watch them 10x or 100x later. The short-term mindset killed me. If you really believe in a company and have done the work, sometimes the best move is to sit on your hands and let time do the heavy lifting.
2. **Not focusing on my edge.** Most of my losses came from chasing trends outside of my lane. Where I’ve consistently done well is riding blue chips and staying in areas where I actually understand the fundamentals. It’s boring sometimes, but boring makes money as much as people on social media preach the opposite.

If I could give my younger self advice:

* Journal every trade so you can see your *own* patterns (good and bad).
* Don’t force setups just to feel active — patience > action.
* Protect your mental capital. Trading scared is worse than not trading at all.

That’s just my take though. So, I’m curious, for those of you with more years under your belt: what’s the #1 mistake you wish you could go back and avoid?",25,4,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nkkj55/20_years_of_trading_my_biggest_mistakes_lessons/,new,Advice,0.86

1nkhybe,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 15:33:31,Trading Is the Hardest Thing I’ve Ever Done,"

I grew up in a small town in Mexico. My parents worked jobs that barely kept food on the table, and from a young age, I knew if I wanted something more, I’d have to figure it out myself. At 19, I crossed the border with nothing but a backpack, a few clothes, and a dream of building a better life.

I washed dishes, stocked shelves overnight, and sent money home when I could. I shared a one-bedroom apartment with three other guys just to cover rent. Some weeks I worked 70–80 hours, only to end up with barely enough left to buy groceries. It was exhausting, but I kept telling myself, “This is temporary, justy keep moving.”

Then I discovered amazon FBA, failed. Dropshipping, failed and then finallly trading. I thought it would be my escape, finally a way to use my brain instead of my back. I opened a brokerage account, put in a few thousand dollars, and thought I could flip it fast. I lost it all in less than two months. The frustration was unreal. I felt like I was running in circles: breaking my body at work, then burning through savings at night chasing green candles.

But I didn’t quit. I slowed down and started studying. I found futures and realized this was a real profession, not a shortcut. I backtested for months. I journaled every mistake. I cut my size to the smallest possible and focused on surviving first. Slowly, things started to click. My first payout from a prop firm wasn’t big, just $1,000 but it felt like the world to me. It proved I wasn’t crazy for believing I could do this.

Here’s what trading taught me: it’s not a hustle, it’s a mirror. It shows you every weakness and impatience, ego, greed and forces you to deal with them. That’s why it’s harder than any job I’ve ever worked. Because it doesn’t just demand skill; it demands you to change who you are.

Today, I’m not rich, but I’m consistent. I can finally say I trade with confidence. I still send money home. I still live simply. But I built this life from nothing, and that’s something no one can take from me.

And if there’s one thing I know for sure:

1nkclol,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 12:13:24,Trying to find trading for my risk tolerance and personality,"EDIT: Title should say trading/investing strategies.    
  
FYI, I have another thread on the bogle head and I have some indexes I've picked and going to see how they do.  However, I'm curious as to others in my situation and mindset, what strategies have you went with and why.  Also, what tools, data etc are you using.

For me, I get stock purchases every quarter at a discount some options.  So that's what put me in the market many years ago.  I just never looked at it until around 2020 where I got more aggressive on also doing a large paycheck contribution as well.

This past year, things have really taken off, I have nvda like everybody, then other mag 7 because I believe in AI and the changes it's going to make.  I have had the voo's, schg's etc.

In April, like everybody else, heart sank when taking those kinds of loses but I've always looked at the market like calculated gambling so easy come easy go.  But then the recovery has been a sight to watch.

So now, I have some of the boglehead strategy to see how it does.  Some in high yield savings I'm looking to convert to bonds.

But I'd really like to start learning how to understand and pick companies without just knowing they are doing good in the tech industry and have a ""feeling"" they are going to do good.  My instincts told me to purchase Broadcom and Oracle a year ago, but I already have a lot in companies like nvda, the voice of reason keeps pulling me back to not be greedy and risk $ making 4.5% right now when I have quite a bit in equities.

However, I want to try and learn for example, BBW, when I go look at the performance of that the past few years, it's been better than Nvda.  In my paper trading account on alpaca, I'm up 5k in the past month on it and the indicators and reports I look at in Fidelity have it as good as anything I have invested.  But then i watch it daily, it's a lot more volatile than a nvda, msft, googl it seems.

So is so much out there and most seems it's more about getting $ from you on a proven strategy than actually being worthwhile.

I don't have time to day trade so not looking to scalp, I'm more so looking for ways to try and find good compound earners and learn how to take my current assets and have the work for me in a comfortable fashion without basically putting everything on black and letting it ride.

To be clear, I'm not asking for stock picks, a breakdown of large cap, small cap, bonds etc, just what others are doing if you just like to research, learn what companies are good or have the potential to do good and have a good idea of the upside and down side risk say the next 1/4, 6 months or year.

In summary, for somebody that just wants to research and find companies, indexes, etfs have potential to be the next palantir, nvda, probably a chatgpt if it ever goes public etc, and do so in a way that you know how to monitor and know when the indicators point to it's time to move on.

Also, not looking to put an entire portfolio into this, just going to start taking any extra change I have and start learning how.  What tools would you recommend?  Trading View with Alpaca, or there is [investor.com](http://investor.com) and others.  Also, would be curious as to why you use what you use as well.

Finally, I'm not young, not trying to get rich quick, but as I put in my post in the boglehead section, if I could figure out a way to comfortably take what I have an make 6 to 8% on average, then I'm lucky enough right now to be able to cover expenses and keep growing assets which for me would finally be freedom.  :)  Yes I'm researching and going through other recommendations but there is just so much and starting my own thread I can use in my search.",1,2,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nkclol/trying_to_find_trading_for_my_risk_tolerance_and/,new,Discussion,1.0
1nkbkcx,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 11:35:00,Thinking about Luck,"Probability and luck are not either/or. You don't need to exclusively subscribe to probability or exclusively subscribe to luck in stock market trading. I think this is where people face-off with absolute conviction to one or the other, but reading Taleb on luck and black swans, I'm starting to see that being a probability absolutist is nearly as bad as subscribing to having zero belief that anything you do will make a difference because it's all luck.

If you ignore the possibility of luck (good and bad), then you are missing a piece of the risk puzzle. Even if you don't change anything in your approach, it is advantageous to be aware of luck and to think about how it might impact your strategy.

The most important question for me being, am I doing enough to cover my arse if a piece of bad luck strikes. This doesn't necessarily mean becoming overly defensive, but the most basic means of protection is only investing what you can afford to lose. (This is the no. 1 trading rule based on luck.)

The thing I've changed based on this awareness of luck is to not be too exact with probability, and not treat it like I'm reading tea leaves of what will happen and that it remains a set of guidelines the accuracy of which only the real world will determine, so my probability margins must be meatily weighted towards profitability but be general enough to not simply cherry pick from the past.",1,3,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nkbkcx/thinking_about_luck/,new,Discussion,1.0

I post this to show you all out there that are struggling and that think you cannot do it what real trading looks like. A lot people say a lot of things, but no one really shows something real. This is real. This is my trading in my ThinkOrSwim account, honestly I am not sure if this is all year or what the exact time frame because when I change the dates not much changes. BUT, this is my performance. I want to you to notice a few things. 

1. I cut losses quickly. 

2. I have several good gainers from my basic strategy

3. I get lucky and get a big winner every once in a while! 

This has been fairly consistent for me over the past several years, I was profitable in 2017 and I haven't looked back! I caught, TSLA, NVDA and now IONQ those have been my big winners. But as shown in the screenshot I can make good money in many other names. If your account can look anywhere near this in terms of your losers being small and your winners being big then you will be successful at trading. 

I think its paramount to 100% believe that you are taking the right approach, my strategy is a mix of things, its IBD breakouts with options with my own mix of things I have noticed and learned over the years. I believe in market themes and CHARTS. 

I ALSO TIME THE MARKETS for all you saying you cannot time the markets. No YOU can't time the markets, but people do it every day. I trade several other accounts as well and have 10's 4 accounts with just leveraged ETFs and market timing.

Also notice that I was able to lose money on PLTR this year! No one is perfect, so don't judge 

I know eventually this post will get buried, but this is what it looks like when you manage your risk/reward levels, have patience when entering positions and are picky with what you trade. I missed out on so many but honestly I can't recall them so does it really matter? This is not a cherry picked list, I was surprised by how little names I traded, but this is the whole thing.

The plan is straightforward, build a $15K cushion from trading profits alone before leaving my job. That gives me a full year of living expenses covered:

• $2,760 for rent ($230 x 12 months)
• $4,560 for my salary ($380 x 12 months)

I’m already accustomed to living lean and making ~$238/month at my current job, so survival isn’t the issue. The first three months after leaving won’t even be focused on trading. They’ll be about decompressing, appreciating life, and recharging before going all-in.

That’s it. No overcomplication, no delusion, just a base, a buffer, and time.

1nk9w4g,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 10:31:23,Ready to be embarrassed.. here are my biggest mistakes I made in my first year of trading...,"Lol when I first started messing around with stocks and option trading, I thought I was smarter than the market. I genuinely wanted to ""turn $1000 into $10000"" and just keep going. So, I watched all the videos, read all the stupid books, and figured I’d pick it up fast. Instead, my first year was a series of expensive lessons. It was bad. I blew up accounts, overtraded, and ignored the basics that I now know are non-negotiable. If you’re just starting out, i reaply wanted to write out my biggest mistakes I made that you can hopefully avoid. This is part 2 of an ongoing education series for those who are interested in following. Hopefully this can help some of you guys.

1. Trading too big, too soon.

Sizing up too fast was my downfall more than once. I thought the quickest way to grow an account was to swing big. The problem is, your emotions swing just as big. When you’re over-leveraged, you stop following your plan and start praying. That’s when panic selling, bag-holding, and account blow-ups happen.

Looking back, I should’ve kept my position size embarrassingly small until I was profitable for months at a time. Trading tiny builds discipline without wrecking your confidence or your account. The truth is, year one isn’t about making money, it’s about surviving long enough to actually get good.

2. Chasing alerts and hype.

Bruh, I spent months glued to X or reddit “gurus.” Every time they called out a ticker, I’d jump in without thinking. I almost always bought too late, and when the move reversed, I’d eat the loss. It felt like I was trading, but really I was just gambling on other people’s ideas.

The problem is you don’t have conviction in trades you didn’t find yourself. You’ll panic out the second it goes red, or hold too long hoping the guru is right. Once I ditched alerts and focused on building my own watchlists, my trading improved overnight. If you can’t explain why you’re in a trade, you shouldn’t be in it.

3. Ignoring stop losses.

This was my most expensive mistake. I’d set a stop, but when price got close I’d convince myself to “give it room.” Before I knew it, the loss was 3x what I planned. It only takes a couple of these to wreck your account and your headspace.

The truth is, honoring stops isn’t about being right or wrong; it’s about protecting your capital so you can trade another day. Blowing past stops is a rookie move that costs you money and keeps you stuck in a cycle of regret. If you only fix one mistake from this list, make it this one.

4. Overtrading out of boredom.

The urge to click buttons just to feel like you’re “doing something” is real. I’d sit there staring at charts, waiting for action, and eventually take subpar trades just to scratch the itch. Most of those turned into small, frustrating losses that added up.

Learning to do nothing when nothing’s there was one of the hardest skills I had to learn. Some days the best trade really is no trade. The market rewards patience, not action. Treat your trading capital like bullets; you don’t fire unless the target is clear.

5. Thinking strategy was everything.

In my first year, I hopped from one strategy to the next like a kid in a candy store. I thought I just hadn’t found the “holy grail” yet. The problem wasn’t the strategies... it was me. I wasn’t giving anything enough time to actually master it, and I wasn’t disciplined enough to stick to the rules.

What I eventually realized is that most strategies work if you execute them consistently and manage risk. Two traders can run the same setup (one profits, the other blows up) because psychology, discipline, and risk management matter more than the setup itself.

6. Not tracking my trades.

I went months without journaling or reviewing my trades. At the time, I thought I’d just “remember” what worked. Lol I didn’t... I repeated the same mistakes over and over because I had no system for holding myself accountable.

Once I started journaling (writing down why I entered, why I exited, and how I felt) I saw my patterns clear as day. I realized I revenge traded after losses, chased green candles, and cut winners too early. Tracking isn’t sexy, but it’s the only way to spot flaws in your behavior and actually fix them.

7. Not protecting my mental health.

Trading wrecked me emotionally that first year. I tied my self-worth to my P/L, so every red day felt like a personal failure. I’d overtrade trying to “make it back” or sit there depressed after one bad trade. That cycle burned me out.

The fix was learning to detach from the outcome of a single trade or even a single day. The only thing that matters is consistency over time. If you let your emotions run the show, you’ll destroy yourself. Protecting your mindset is just as important as protecting your account balance.


Take away

Your first year probably won’t make you rich. Mine didn’t. What it will do is teach you the lessons that separate gamblers from traders. Blowups, losses, and frustration are part of the process, but you don’t need to make all the same mistakes I did. Start small, track everything, respect risk, and don’t forget this is a long game. I plan on posting more here so feel free to follow my acc if you're interested.

1nk9ia5,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 10:16:30,How can i improve my strategy,"Core flow
	1.	Reference levels (HTF H/L): Uses previous 4H / Daily / Weekly / Monthly highs & lows (locked to the prior closed bar).
	2.	Sweep detection (on MTF): Detects when price sweeps above/below those HTF levels on a chosen MTF (mtfTF) with a small buffer and optional close condition.
	3.	MTF FVG confirmation: On the same MTF, confirms a bull/bear FVG (no repaint—uses confirmed bars only).
	•	When sweep + FVG align, it records the FVG range and the MTF swing (the pivot that “created” that FVG).
	4.	First Touch → “Strong” trigger (on LTF):
	•	Waits for First Touch of that MTF FVG on the LTF (close inside the zone).
	•	After FT, it arms a “strong” entry condition: requires a new LTF FVG in the same direction (optional minimum gap %).
	•	There’s a TTL (max bars to wait after FT) you can set; if it expires, the window closes.
	•	Safety: If the MTF swing that created the FVG breaks after FT, it stops searching for the LTF confirmation.
	5.	Filters:
	•	Killzones (UTC-4) time filter.
	•	AlphaTrend bias (optional): Only long when AT is rising, only short when falling.
	6.	Risk/Trade management:
	•	Position sizing by % of initial capital.
	•	SL can be based on LTF swing or the MTF swing that created the FVG (your choice), with optional pad %.
	•	Optional fixed TP by RR (e.g., 2R).
	7.	Visuals:
	•	Draws the MTF FVG zone (lines + optional fill).
	•	Draws a horizontal sweep line from the level’s previous HTF bar time to the bar that caused the sweep at the exact swept price (bull uses the low-side level, bear the high-side level).

Backtests can look great, but we all know they can be overfit. Forward tests give more confidence, but they take time and may not capture every condition.

In my own journey, I struggled with this question until I started using SpeedBot for my option strategies. The workflow of building a strategy without code, backtesting, forward testing, and then running it live with automated execution and detailed reports gave me a much clearer way to evaluate performance step by step. It did not make the decision easy, but it did make the process structured and less about guesswork.

I am curious how others here approach this.

When I sized too big, every tick against me felt like my stomach was dropping. I’d close trades early just to “feel safe,” or I’d add more size to “fix” a bad entry. It wasn’t the market beating me, it was my own emotions.



Once I started tracking everything, I noticed something insane: my win rate barely changed when I cut my size in half. But my stress level dropped by 80%. Suddenly, I was following my rules. Suddenly my setups actually had a chance to play out.



That’s when I learned: risk management isn’t about surviving one trade. It’s about giving yourself the mental space to survive the next 1,000 trades.



Profitable trading isn’t about swinging for home runs. It’s about staying alive long enough to let your edge work.

  
A lot of traders get too focused on the most perfect entry, but they should actually build a risk management system after they've found their edge and model.

	•	Some words are also tickers (e.g. “CAN” or “ALL”), which turns the results into clown data.

	•	Has anyone here built/used a tool like this?
	•	Any tricks for capturing mentions without requiring the $ sign, but without false positives?

I took a break, then used some money I had saved up to try again. That’s when I found TJR’s bootcamp, which pulled me into futures trading. Through him, I learned about prop firms.

I’ve blown probably 40 accounts and lost thousands of dollars. My turning point was when I stopped trying to learn every little thing about trading — whether it was on TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube. I cut all of it out and just stuck to one model (still TJR’s trading model), just with a different form of entry and a slightly different way of viewing it.

Once I cut the noise out and focused on one model, I was able to turn profitable and pass accounts easily.

The only tips I have are: FIND A MENTOR AND STICK TO IT. And find a community or someone who can hold you accountable for your actions. Once you master your strategy — whatever it may be — it’s all about psychology.

1njbd5d,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 08:09:59,Not getting confidence in any strategy.,"I have been trading for last 4 yrs. Recently, I have realised that I have got everything in line psychology, risk management, time frame to trade on, journalling, etc. One bottleneck, since a long time has been no confidence in my strategy, to earn 50% win rate. Brief background, I am an intraday trader, trade with 15mins candles, in the Indian stock market. I have expectation to have a 50% win rate and a 1:2RR. I am also mentally strong enough to bare the DD and I accept the loss as it is nothing but the trade went on the other side of the probability and accept that won or loss in this is not in my control but, over a period of time, I will have a decent win rate. 

The problem: 
I have tried a lot of times to understand that price and patterns are formed by market participants psychology and tried to make sense of it but, I can't logically accept the fact that traders and investors are looking at the trendline and reacting at that level. I firmly believe that whatever actions they are taking is based on the new update about that company or generally which led them to make the decision. Traders takes the action with or after an investor has made his action to a update. I believe that in the past if people sold the stock at 100, doesn't mean this time also they will sell at 100. this makes no sense to me. I have worked at an investment firm and investors don't make decisions based on the levels. In short, I don't believe past traders and investors actions will have any influence on the current or future actions but a new update will. My edge will come from me reacting on that update first and then other people reacting will shoot the price up and I will make money. But, here also I am not sure if I will have a 50% prob or not and just not sure what to do. I do believe in swings and keep at stops at the swing lows.

1nj47mb,2025-09-17,2025-09-17 01:03:31,😌 Stoic Secrets for Trading Success,"Markets test patience, discipline, and resilience every single day. Stoicism, a philosophy built on clarity and self-mastery, offers traders tools to survive volatility and avoid self-destruction.

Here are ten principles worth living by:

🟡 Focus on what you can control

You can’t control the market, the news cycle, or other traders. You can control your research, your risk management, and your execution. Anchor yourself there.

🟡 Cultivate a growth mindset

Losses aren’t failure, they’re tuition. Keep a journal, extract lessons, and adapt. Each trade becomes a step forward.

🟡 Practice self-discipline

Stick to your plan when emotions flare. Review rules daily, set clear intentions, and don’t let fear or greed dictate entries.

🟡 Embrace discomfort

Volatility, new assets, losing trades - they all sharpen you. Lean into what feels uncomfortable, it expands your skillset.

🟡 Live with purpose and integrity

Trading for money alone leads to reckless choices. Define your deeper “why” and align your actions with it.

🟡 Build resilience

One bad week doesn’t end a career. Detach self-worth from outcomes, learn, reset, and stay in the game.

🟡 Practice gratitude

Gratitude keeps perspective. Wins, losses, even the chance to trade at all - acknowledge them. It strengthens mindset.

🟡 Self-reflection

Review your trades, but also your emotions. Awareness of your own patterns is often the biggest edge.

🟡 Cultivate strong relationships

Even in a solitary craft, community matters. Mentors, peers, and trading circles expand perspective and keep you grounded.

🟡 Focus on long-term goals

Day-to-day noise is a distraction. Sustainable trading comes from compounding disciplined decisions over years, not chasing every quick win.

Trading is more than charts and setups. It’s a battle with yourself. Stoic principles won’t make you rich overnight, but they’ll keep you standing long enough to let skill and discipline pay off.

1nik9y3,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 11:14:20,"5 years of trading, my best tips","I’ve been day trading full-time for about 5 years now. In that time, I’ve blown up accounts, had winning streaks, and gone through phases where I thought I finally “figured it out” only to get humbled the next week. If you’re just getting into this, I’ll save you a lot of pain by sharing the biggest lessons I wish someone drilled into me early on.

1. Risk management is everything.

This is the hill most beginners die on. It doesn’t matter how good your strategy looks, how many indicators you stack on your chart, or how many “conviction trades” you think you’ve found... if you don’t have strict risk rules, the market will clean you out. Always know your max risk per trade. For most people, that’s around 1–2% of your account balance. It sounds boring, but it’s the only thing that keeps you alive long enough to actually learn.

The temptation to “average down” or hold losers is massive when you’re new. You’ll convince yourself that a stock “has to bounce” or “can’t go any lower,” and then watch it tank another 10%. Every trader who’s lasted has their scars from ignoring stop losses. Treat capital like ammo; you only get so much of it, and wasting it on stubbornness will take you out of the game fast.

2. Don’t overtrade.

One of the biggest mistakes I see (and made myself) is thinking you need to be in a trade all the time. The reality is most of the market is just noise. The edge comes from waiting for the handful of clean setups each week that actually make sense. Some of my best months have come from taking fewer than 20 trades total.

It feels counterintuitive at first. You think, “If I’m not in a trade, I’m not making money.” But that’s backwards. By forcing trades, you’re just paying commissions, racking up losses, and burning mental energy. A huge skill in day trading is learning to sit on your hands until your setup appears. That patience is where consistency comes from.

3. Journaling changes the game.

I used to think journaling was pointless. Then I realized most of my losing trades weren’t about the strategy at all; they were about me. When you actually write down why you entered, why you exited, and what you were feeling at the time, patterns start to appear. You might notice you revenge trade after a loss, or that you take bad setups when you’re bored.

Your trading journal becomes your mirror. It forces you to face the truth instead of lying to yourself with hindsight. Over time, it’s less about “what did the chart do” and more about “why did I react this way.” That self-awareness is where growth happens, and without it, you’ll keep repeating the same mistakes.

4. Keep your setup simple.

When you’re new, you want to believe the answer is some secret indicator or complex strategy nobody else knows. So you start stacking indicators until your chart looks like Times Square. I went through that phase too. But after years of testing, I came back to the basics: clean price action, volume, and maybe one or two moving averages. That’s it.

The market isn’t hiding anything from you. Overcomplication just creates decision paralysis. The pros aren’t out here with 15 indicators... they’re reading levels, momentum, and supply/demand zones. Keep your charts clean, focus on setups you can repeat, and you’ll save yourself years of frustration.

5. Protect your mental health.

Trading will wreck you if you let it. If you’re risking rent money or grocery money, you’re trading scared, and scared traders make terrible decisions. You’ll cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and constantly feel like your back’s against the wall. That’s not trading, that’s gambling under pressure.

Detach yourself from the outcome of any single trade. This is easier said than done, but the only way to do it is by trading money you can afford to lose and keeping size small until you’re consistent. If a red day ruins your mood for 24 hours, you’re too emotionally tied to your positions. Protect your headspace first; the money follows when you’re calm.

6. Learn from screen time, not YouTube gurus.

There’s a ton of content online, but no video or course will replace actually watching the market tick by tick. You need screen time to understand how price moves, how news impacts volatility, and how momentum builds and fades. That “intuition” you see in experienced traders doesn’t come from books, it comes from thousands of hours watching patterns unfold live.

Don’t get me wrong, you can pick up useful basics from videos. But the real learning happens when you put skin in the game, track your trades, and experience the emotions firsthand. Nobody can teach you how you react to fear and greed, that’s something only screen time reveals.

7. Consistency > home runs.

The biggest misconception beginners have is thinking they need a massive trade to “make it.” They see screenshots of 10k days on Twitter and start chasing jackpots. The truth is, most accounts blow up because people swing for the fences. Survival in this game comes from small, consistent wins while keeping losses tiny.

A steady $100 a day, compounded, crushes the guy who tries to make $1,000 in one shot and wipes half his account. The math is simple, but the ego makes it hard to follow. Focus on consistency, build confidence, and scale later. Day trading is a marathon of small edges, not a lottery ticket.

Bottom line.

Day trading isn’t easy. Most people fail not because they can’t read charts, but because they underestimate how much discipline, patience, and emotional control it really takes. If you treat this like a craft instead of a get-rich-quick scheme, you’ll give yourself a real shot.

I really like this community so plan on doing more write-ups like these as a mini education series. If you guys want, my next one can be about 

A) The biggest mistakes I made in my first year of day trading (so you don’t have to)

B) What a ‘normal’ day actually looks like as a full-time day trader

C) Why 90% of traders quit in under 2 years (and how not to be one of them)

1nihpm1,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 09:36:43,Consistency Turns Losses Into Opportunities,"When I first started trading, I was losing more often than winning. My own family would laugh at me, saying I was just wasting my time staring at charts all day. It was tough, but I didn’t quit. I kept learning, adjusted my mistakes, and slowly built discipline.

Fast forward to today, some of those same family members who once laughed now ask me for financial help. That’s when I realized, losses were never failures, they were lessons. Every trader starts rough, but the key is staying consistent and growing through it.

That’s also why I look forward to things like the Onchain Trading Competition. Bitget recently raised the reward pool to 300 BGB (up from 200), and this round features $AVNT, $USELESS, and $TRADOOR. I’ve been trading $AVNT actively, especially with how its price has been moving lately, and the comp adds an extra layer of motivation.

I even received some $BGB rewards from the last Onchain Competition 52, so I’m jumping back in again. For me, it’s not just about the prizes, it’s about proving that the discipline I built during those tough early days is exactly what allows me to take advantage of opportunities like this now.

Losses. Lessons. Discipline. That’s what really turns the tables and right now, it’s also what makes this comp worth the grind.",3,4,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nihpm1/consistency_turns_losses_into_opportunities/,new,Discussion,0.81
1nih0vb,2025-09-16,2025-09-16 09:08:53,"Trading Memecoins Taught Me Discipline, Not Just Hype","Memecoins move fast, but for me, trading them has been less about chasing pumps and more about understanding how quickly narratives shift in the market.

When I first started looking at them, I thought it was all about timing the moonshot. The reality is, most of the time the big moves happen before you even hear about them. I learned that the hard way, jumping in late and watching positions reverse almost immediately. It was frustrating, but it also taught me a valuable lesson: don’t just follow hype, focus on risk management and execution.

Over time, I realized memecoins aren’t really about fundamentals but about sentiment, community energy, and speed. Once I accepted that, I stopped expecting them to behave like other assets and started treating them as high-volatility trades that require discipline.

Recently, I have been trading some of the newer tokens like $KOGE, $CARDS, and $TROLL, and I have been keeping myself engaged through structured challenges. One example is the Bitget Onchain Challenge Phase 18, which has a 100,000 BGB reward pool tied to trading activity. For me, it’s less about the rewards and more about having a system that keeps me consistent, accountable, and focused on the process rather than the quick wins.

That shift in mindset has made all the difference. Instead of seeing memecoins as a lottery ticket, I now see them as a testing ground for discipline, strategy, and emotional control.",5,7,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nih0vb/trading_memecoins_taught_me_discipline_not_just/,new,Strategy,0.73

1nhwks9,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 16:06:35,Why you probably should STOP NOW if you’re thinking of getting into trading,"I had everything going for me in life. But I decided what I had wasn’t paying me fast enough and I started pouring myself into trading, hoping to escape the matrix.

Fast forward 6 years, and I basically was back to even after the trump tariff scare. I knew I had to quit and I walked away.

Trading taught me basically no hard skills that were transferable to any other field.

It made me a worse person in so many ways.

It isolated me from society and people who love and care about me. It did nothing to help my social skills. It made it harder for me to stay in shape physically and eat healthily. It added insane levels of stress that I sometimes tried to eliminate in less than healthy ways.

I am grateful that God gave me another chance and I now have professional success outside the markets that came from applying myself to my field of study in school, with networking, mentorship and investment in my real business outside the markets.

In the unlikely event you do better than I did, you’re still contributing nothing to society. People will respect you less than a door to door home improvement salesman. And for good reason - society wouldn’t function if we were all trying to trade for a living. Ain’t no woman out there want to introduce her boyfriend or husband to her friends and have to tell them he trades for a living. If you so much as buy a pickup truck and start a junk hauling business, that’s better evidence of you making money than claiming you’re a trader.

Please for the love of all that’s good, don’t throw away some of the best years of your life like I did. If you’re convinced, I can’t stop you, but if you’re even marginally on the fence, please at least take some time before trying to get into this. Ask your friends and family what they honestly think, and listen to them.

1nhrbh0,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 12:54:49,Learning to Look Beyond Timing in Trading,"I’ve been chasing timing for some certain years now while always trying to get in just before the move, i was always checking if my entry could’ve been sharper. Sometimes I got it right, and it felt good, but other times it left me frustrated because the market doesn’t care about perfection. I think i have caught the spot, then watch the chart and realize there are a lot of things to reconsider. That constant chase can eat away at the joy of trading if you let it.

I felt that a lot with so many tokens $CUDIS, $USDUC etc. I wasn’t super early on them, and it bothered me at first. I thought I had lost it all, but it didn’t feel that way when I saw the volume building after I was already in. Later on, it clicked. curiosity made be  look deeper to the extent i realized people were rushing into the tokens from bitget because they are part of the required set in the phase 53 onchain trading competition. That changed the angle for me. It wasn’t about me being late now, it was about understanding why the demand suddenly stacked up and how competitions like this shape short term sentiment.

That realization made me take a step back. Instead of beating myself up about not being first, I started asking what comes after timing. Position sizing, discipline, patience, and a better deep research, those things matter more than catching the very bottom. Anyone can jump in, but it’s happened once you’re in that separates random luck from real structure. Timing can give you a head start, but focus keeps you in the race.

So now my mindset is shifting. I still care about entries, but I’m not letting them define my whole trade. I want to build habits around how I handle and research on market movements, because the market keeps proving it’s not only about who shows up first, it’s about who knows how to move when the crowd finally arrives.",3,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1nhrbh0/learning_to_look_beyond_timing_in_trading/,new,Discussion,1.0

On one side the labor market is showing more cracks than expected, weaker payrolls, slower job growth, and signs that wage momentum is cooling. That would normally strengthen the case for cuts.

On the other hand, we’re still facing sticky inflation risks, Tariffs are adding pressure, oil isn’t exactly helping, and the Fed has been crystal clear that they don’t want to repeat the mistakes of cutting too early.

1nhh84q,2025-09-15,2025-09-15 05:31:38,Prop Firm Wants My MQL5 Source Code—Is This Normal?,"Hey everyone,

I've been in the software development field for over six years and have recently come across prop firms as a new way to apply my trading strategies.

I decided to start a free trial with a firm, and when I asked about their rules, I received a couple of emails.

First, their support team sent an email (see screenshot 1) saying they would enable my EA if I provided the `.EX5` and `.MQL5` files along with my account number. This immediately raised a huge red flag for me, as providing the `.MQL5` file means giving them the full source code for my strategy.

I then sent them a follow-up email explaining my setup, which is a Python bot communicating with MT5. They responded by saying they don't allow any external APIs or socket communication and that the EA must run solely within the MT5 platform. They also mentioned they've disabled all external API and socket webhook communication (see screenshot 2).

I'm trying to figure out if this is normal for the industry. My main questions for this community are:

1. **Is this a standard practice for prop firms?** Do most of them require you to submit your `.MQL5` (source code) file for review?
2. **Is it a red flag that they're asking for the** `.MQL5` **file?** It feels like I'd be giving away my entire strategy. What are the risks of doing this?
3. Do you know of any reputable prop firms that **don't** require you to hand over your source code files?

Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

	•	Could pressure $NFLX hard, finally forcing them to give up market share

	•	$WBD + $PSKY are also rumored to be circling other deals → the whole space is heating up

If $DIS throws real cash at this, $FUBO valuation could rerate overnight. Traders calling it one of the biggest potential shakeups in streaming.

1nh278g,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 16:38:04,Swing Trading in the Stock Market is Real!,"I wanted to share my experience with swing trading to show that it’s possible to build real wealth through it, even if it’s not easy. I’ve been at it for a few years now, and the results speak for themselves.


In 2023 and 2024, I averaged about 30% returns per year using a local broker. Their analytics were pretty basic—no fancy calendar views—so I can’t share screenshots from back then. 

But starting this year, I switched to Moomoo for better tools and tracking. As of this month (September 2025), I’m up around 130% YTD (refer 1st attachment). Pretty wild, right?


On top of that, I manage a family fund that’s also hit almost 30% gains, and we’ve already made some withdrawals without derailing the growth. (Refer 2nd and 3rd attachment)

A quick note: I always talk in percentages because that’s what keeps me focused and disciplined. Whenever I shift my mindset to dollar amounts, my trades start going sideways—it’s like the greed creeps in and clouds my judgment.


For anyone looking to build wealth through stock market trading, here’s my honest advice based on what I’ve learned:

1. It’s possible, but extremely difficult. Expect setbacks, and be ready to put in the work.

2. Learn as much as you can to build your own system—don’t overwhelm yourself with conflicting info. Focus on what resonates and test it.

3. You make the strategy; don’t let the strategy control you. Adapt it to your style, not the other way around.

4. Self-discovery is a big part of the game. Trading reveals your risk tolerance, emotions, and biases—use that to your advantage.

5. What works for others might not work for you. Experiment, track results, and refine relentlessly.


Just remember, this isn’t financial advice—do your own research.

1ngw28u,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 12:40:40,Why does it take many years to become profitable with trading?,"Hi traders. Im still quite new to trading (trading for only 6 months now). And before i get into this question, I am not claiming to be profitable or nearly there yet, I just wanna know what it takes.

Why does it take most people 3+ years to be profitable when trading is said to be better when it is simplified? In my eyes, the main things you need to be successful are: 

\- A strategy that has been extensively backtested that is proven to work

\- Good risk management

\- The psychological aspect of trading where you objectively follows the rules of your trading plan and not let your emotions impact how you execute and manage trades.

The way i see it: finding a working strategy with good risk management shouldnt take too long if you have enough time. A strategy can be backtested over 12 months within 2 days of being on fxreplay. so theoretically if you have time to you could backtest around 10 strategy variations a month. Forward testing can happen as time goes by.

I understand for some the psychology aspect may take a while to master, but lets say that someone has little emotional decision making from the start and has a vast understanding that trading involves losing as well, you just need a good RR, even though your win rate is less than 50%.

  
Taking into account all the above, I dont see why it cant take someone about a year to become profitable?

I’m still learning and quite new to backtesting, so I’d like to ask how you usually do it on TradingView.
	•	Do you use a split screen with two charts (for example one on Daily and the other on lower timeframes)?
→ And if you do it this way, can you go from Daily all the way down to the 1-minute chart without problems?
	•	Or do you prefer to backtest using just one chart and switch timeframes as you go?

I’ve tried starting from the Daily and then moving down to the 1-minute, which works fine. But when I go the other way around (from lower TF back to higher), TradingView shows me the future candles and that ruins the replay. For my backtesting I really need to move from lower to higher TF to check the overall context without spoiling it.

Do you have any tips or better methods for handling this?

The 5-6 percent may sound great, but I'm not satisfied with this win rate after getting stressed all the month , SO my question is to the PRofitable ONes is this what profitability looks like or is there are strategies I can't find out with  >45-50% winning rate with 1:3 , I have tested these strategies with different risk reward tooo but they can't even get to breakeven ..... WHat should I dooo , help me .... Will i learn things deeply taking my time and should not stress now..? Or is there any advices u wanna give me ....",16,25,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ngt0ir/profitable_strategy/,new,Technical analysis,0.92
1ngslpl,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 10:23:37,I think i’m finally getting it,"I've developed a strategy during this current year and right now the data seems really good.

I have a win rate of 48,7% with an average win of 15,77% and average loss of 3,64% (6% expectancy) Every trade I take goes through a tight screening process, after of which I do my manual research on the fundamentals and then use some technical analysis on the entry. I've been religious about following the strategy and working like a robot inside the parameters I have given myself in terms of risk management and not deviating from the strategy.

I've felt extremely confident in every trade I've taken because I finally feel like I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. (this was not the case when I was experimenting with day trading).

The only problem is I only have 40 trades taken. I take about 3-5 trades a month and I hold for about 2-5 weeks. Can I feel confident or is there a high chance that this is just some lucky streak. I would like to allocate some more capital to this since I finally feel like I've understood what it takes to be profitable, but I'm not sure if I should still wait until I have close to 100 trades taken.",13,13,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1ngslpl/i_think_im_finally_getting_it/,new,Discussion,0.88

So in short these guys are going down, they have a lot of shit to get out of even if they manage to stay afloat they will take a hit, also I got from an employee that they kind of force you to buy stock at least a small amount besides what you are given, to show trust but then selling that stock has become a nightmare it is like money that you know you will lose, and they are trying to avoid even at a legal level employees from panic selling.

First of all let me just post a few images to make it clear that i am not wasting ur time!

Its been a while since me & my dad had been looking out for a company that could help us invest somewhere , when i got advised by my cousin to start trading with the help of a company which provided trading bots, i was very suspicious like anyone would be😅
But i went ahead and observed what my cousin did for a month and IT WAS LEGIT AF, 
I discussed it with my dad, long story short we invested 10 lakh pkr into it (atleast 3000$ is minimum, but 5000$ is safe it prevents tension of liquidation) 
And we are trading in USDCAD, all it requires is a basic knowledge of how the trades work, and just a lot of patience, the bot is designed to wait till the total trade goes +ve to cutt off all the trades, it takes trades on its own sometimes sell sometimes buy and holds it, and Alhamdulillah it makes around 300$ smth a week, half of which goes to the company like 150$, and the rest is ours
I have helped a friend get into this business as well and we are doing pretty good, 
If the mods or admins want to verify the legitimacy you guys can text me personally and i can provide each and every document!

1ngm29g,2025-09-14,2025-09-14 04:41:08,Weekly TA update ES 9/14,"Hi all, Chartstradamus here with my weekly update on ES.

While my charts may seem confusing at first glance, there are resources on my personal channel explaining my system and how to trade it.

For here though, I will keep it simple and highlight potential key areas and levels for the coming week.

Red 1M and Orange 1W chart:

Bulls still fully in control at the top of the structure breaking above the 1M overextension zone, the 1W overextension zone now rests at 6690 for the coming week.

Yellow 1D and Green 4H chart:

Finding support here in the entry zone of the Yellow 1D bull structure with lots of pin reversals in this area the last few weeks showing buyers stepping in.

The confluence around 6690 for the FOMC date I mentioned last week is very much in play.  We also have a confluence of support down at 6405 that could come into play to the downside.

As I mentioned previously, any time there is a confluence like this around an important news event I will pay particular attention too it.

I also mentioned last week, the ability to identify a future time and price point makes for a lucrative opportunity using Options.  

Being that we have both a long and short confluence and the impending news event, makes a perfect opportunity for an OTM straddle near our targets.  

I may do a separate forward test entirely around option strategies after the conclusion of this one if there is any interest.


Blue 1H and Purple 15m chart:

We are nearing overextension on the bull structure of both timeframes.  For this reason I am switching to a near term short bias into FOMC, and even after if we do get a blowoff into overextension and a new ATH ZI still expect a sizable sell off to follow.

Holding some shorts on the intraday account from the 6600 level which I should be out of before the announcement on Wednesday.

In the near term would look to re-enter long around the 6515 level stop outside of structure at 6465 targeting ATH 6615 R:R 2",1,1,0,trading,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngm29g,new,Technical analysis,1.0

While my charts may seem confusing at first glance, there are resources on my personal channel explaining my system and how to trade it.

For here though, I will keep it simple and highlight potential key areas and levels for the coming week.

Red 1M and Orange 1W chart:

Bulls still fully in control at the top of the chart, pushing deeper into overextension on both timeframes toward that 4000 hyperextension level.

Yellow 1D and Green 4H chart:

Pushing deeper into overextension now on the 1D and deep in hyperextension on the 4H.

Our short bias kept us profitable all week with some nice sell offs from what is now appearing to be a local ceiling around the 3700 level.

If this level tests again I would guess we break toward a new ATH, but for a long I am still waiting on a deeper selloff to the 3600 area.  

Realistically I would like for us to test deeper to 3450 but I will have switched my bias back long way before then.

Blue 1H and Purple 15m chart:

We've fallen back into no mans land on the Blue 1H bull structure, we have some new Purple 15 bear structure developing again would not look to it for short entries more of a target/overextension structure.

Will be looking to re-enter long here from the 1H bull entry zone.

Red 1M and Orange 1W chart:

Still sitting in the middle of both channels consolidating downward currently.

Yellow 1D and Green 4H chart:

Still sitting at the entry zone on the Yellow 1D bull structure and holding the breakout zone of the Green 4H bull structure.  

I do have an upward bias but a clean break of the structure would definitely bring the 59 level in play by the end of the week as this area has been tested through several times now.

Blue 1H and Purple 15m chart:

We have some Blue 1H bear structure forming, but I wouldn't look to it for a short until a clean break of our Green 4H bull structure.  

Too early for any Purple 15m structure with all of the volatility toward the end of the week.

If you roll outta bed, slam some coffee, and jump straight into SPY or US30 without a plan, you’re basically gambling. When I take 20–30 mins pre-market to mark my levels, check overnight futures, and journal yesterday’s plays, I trade way calmer and don’t chase every shiny candle.

Think of it like sports — you don’t see ball players showing up to a game without warm-ups. Same with trading: routine builds discipline. My morning prep is like my playbook, and it keeps me from doing dumb stuff like revenge trading.

* Do you edit your videos yourself, or do you hire a video editor?
* Any recommended editing tools or platforms for beginners?
* How do you plan your content or decide what to share?

I also traded Aug 26–29 to demonstrate skill: USD 208.89 → ≈ USD 46,074.59.

From July 11 until shortly before Aug 29, withdrawals and internal transfers were disabled, so I couldn’t de-risk; liquidation followed; withdrawals resumed afterward.

So I ask him: “What would you recommend?”

“I was a long-term investor. Mostly defense stocks.”

Solid. Reasonable. Grandpa Buffett vibes. 
Which sounded pretty legit. But then he suddenly switches gears and tells me:

“Short everything. Short the whole market. Short everything.”
