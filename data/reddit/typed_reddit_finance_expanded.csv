In prepared remarks and responses to lawmakers’ questions during an annual Senate oversight hearing, the CEOs of eight banks sought to raise alarms over the impact of the changes. In July, U.S. regulators unveiled a sweeping set of higher standards governing banks known as the Basel 3 endgame. 

“The rule would have predictable and harmful outcomes to the economy, markets, business of all sizes and American households,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told lawmakers.

If unchanged, the regulations would raise capital requirements on the largest banks by about 25%, Dimon claimed.

The heads of America’s largest banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, are seeking to dull the impact of the new rules, which would affect all U.S. banks with at least $100 billion in assets and take until 2028 to be fully phased in.

Silicon Valley Bank [collapsed on Friday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/svb-financial-pulls-capital-raise-explores-alternatives-including-possible-sale-sources-say-11de7522?st=n8k5sfijmrslhqe), becoming the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history in terms of assets. On Sunday, regulators also [took control of Signature Bank](https://www.wsj.com/articles/signature-bank-is-shut-by-regulators-after-svb-failure-a5f9e0f7?st=rqheapcz7i70sq9) and [rolled out emergency measures](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-rolls-out-emergency-measures-to-prevent-banking-crisis-ba4d7f98?st=099a0fcprdltckb) to prevent a banking crisis and guarantee depositors access to their money. This means businesses with big deposits stuck at the banks will get their money out, though [likely not soon](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-offers-aid-to-silicon-valley-bank-customers-4a8c3f1c?st=b21fgpfmrxh50x1).

This meltdown has exposed a new set of vulnerabilities for the financial system — and the rest of [the banking system is on edge](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-braces-for-the-next-silicon-valley-bank-956b8f03?st=4weob1ikkgc2c8l).

We are Rachel Louise Ensign and Ben Eisen, banking and finance reporters for the WSJ covering the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Ask us anything.

Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are among banks that have been acting as brokers to facilitate growing investor demand for ways to trade Russian-related assets. Both are said to have reached out to investors in recent weeks offering ruble-linked derivative contracts—a trade that’s allowed under Western sanctions because there’s no physical Russian asset and it doesn’t involve any Russian nationals. The contract essentially gives traders a legal workaround to profit if the currency continues to surge in value. ,127,12,0,finance,reddit,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/goldman-jpmorgan-among-banks-offering-more-russia-linked-trades?cmpid=eveus&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=250305&utm_campaign=eveus,year,0,0.94

“Mea culpa. Having last week got rather excited by the minutiae of Tesla’s accounting, it’s time to row back on the apparent $1.4bn gap between capital investment and asset values.

The question of why a cash-rich company raised new debt in both of the last two years still stands, as does the trajectory of that cash balance if car sales continue to crater. But Tesla’s balance-sheet mismatch may have a benign explanation.”

In prepared remarks and responses to lawmakers’ questions during an annual Senate oversight hearing, the CEOs of eight banks sought to raise alarms over the impact of the changes. In July, U.S. regulators unveiled a sweeping set of higher standards governing banks known as the Basel 3 endgame. 

“The rule would have predictable and harmful outcomes to the economy, markets, business of all sizes and American households,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told lawmakers.

If unchanged, the regulations would raise capital requirements on the largest banks by about 25%, Dimon claimed.

The heads of America’s largest banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, are seeking to dull the impact of the new rules, which would affect all U.S. banks with at least $100 billion in assets and take until 2028 to be fully phased in.

Silicon Valley Bank [collapsed on Friday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/svb-financial-pulls-capital-raise-explores-alternatives-including-possible-sale-sources-say-11de7522?st=n8k5sfijmrslhqe), becoming the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history in terms of assets. On Sunday, regulators also [took control of Signature Bank](https://www.wsj.com/articles/signature-bank-is-shut-by-regulators-after-svb-failure-a5f9e0f7?st=rqheapcz7i70sq9) and [rolled out emergency measures](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-rolls-out-emergency-measures-to-prevent-banking-crisis-ba4d7f98?st=099a0fcprdltckb) to prevent a banking crisis and guarantee depositors access to their money. This means businesses with big deposits stuck at the banks will get their money out, though [likely not soon](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-offers-aid-to-silicon-valley-bank-customers-4a8c3f1c?st=b21fgpfmrxh50x1).

This meltdown has exposed a new set of vulnerabilities for the financial system — and the rest of [the banking system is on edge](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-braces-for-the-next-silicon-valley-bank-956b8f03?st=4weob1ikkgc2c8l).

We are Rachel Louise Ensign and Ben Eisen, banking and finance reporters for the WSJ covering the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Ask us anything.

18cj1bv,2023-12-06,2023-12-06 19:41:41,"Wall Street CEOs say proposed banking rules will hurt small businesses, low-income Americans","Wall Street CEOs on Wednesday pushed back against proposed regulations aimed at raising the levels of capital they’ll need to hold against future risks.

In prepared remarks and responses to lawmakers’ questions during an annual Senate oversight hearing, the CEOs of eight banks sought to raise alarms over the impact of the changes. In July, U.S. regulators unveiled a sweeping set of higher standards governing banks known as the Basel 3 endgame. 

“The rule would have predictable and harmful outcomes to the economy, markets, business of all sizes and American households,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told lawmakers.

If unchanged, the regulations would raise capital requirements on the largest banks by about 25%, Dimon claimed.

The heads of America’s largest banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, are seeking to dull the impact of the new rules, which would affect all U.S. banks with at least $100 billion in assets and take until 2028 to be fully phased in. Raising the cost of capital would likely hurt the industry’s profitability and growth prospects.",303,85,0,finance,reddit,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/wall-street-ceos-say-proposed-banking-rules-will-hurt-small-businesses-rcna128435,new,0,0.92

Silicon Valley Bank [collapsed on Friday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/svb-financial-pulls-capital-raise-explores-alternatives-including-possible-sale-sources-say-11de7522?st=n8k5sfijmrslhqe), becoming the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history in terms of assets. On Sunday, regulators also [took control of Signature Bank](https://www.wsj.com/articles/signature-bank-is-shut-by-regulators-after-svb-failure-a5f9e0f7?st=rqheapcz7i70sq9) and [rolled out emergency measures](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-rolls-out-emergency-measures-to-prevent-banking-crisis-ba4d7f98?st=099a0fcprdltckb) to prevent a banking crisis and guarantee depositors access to their money. This means businesses with big deposits stuck at the banks will get their money out, though [likely not soon](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-offers-aid-to-silicon-valley-bank-customers-4a8c3f1c?st=b21fgpfmrxh50x1).

This meltdown has exposed a new set of vulnerabilities for the financial system — and the rest of [the banking system is on edge](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-braces-for-the-next-silicon-valley-bank-956b8f03?st=4weob1ikkgc2c8l).

We are Rachel Louise Ensign and Ben Eisen, banking and finance reporters for the WSJ covering the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Ask us anything.
