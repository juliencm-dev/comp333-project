1jq1qji,2025-04-02,2025-04-02 18:24:11,"Trump's ""Tariff"" Numbers Are Just Trade Balance Ratios","These ""tariff"" numbers provided by the administration are just ludicrous. They don't reflect any version of reality where real tariffs are concerned. I was convinced they weren't just completely made up, though, and their talk about trade balances made me curious enough to dig in and try to find where they got these numbers.

This guess paid off immediately. As far as I can tell with just a tiny bit of digging, almost all of these numbers are literally just the inverse of our trade balance as a ratio. Every value I have tried this calculation on, it has held true.


I'll just use the 3 highest as examples:

***Cambodia: 97%***

US exports to Cambodia: $321.6 M

Cambodia exports to US: 12.7 B

Ratio: 321.6M / 12.7 B = ~3%

https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/southeast-asia-pacific/Cambodia-

***Vietnam: 90%***

US exports to Vietnam: $13.1 B

Vietnam exports to US: $136.6 B

Ratio: 13.1B / 136.6B = ~10%

https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/southeast-asia-pacific/vietnam

***Sri Lanka: 88%***

US exports to Sri Lanka: $368.2 M

Sri Lanka exports to US: $3.0 B

Ratio: ~12%

https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/south-central-asia/sri-lanka

What the Administration appears to be calling a ""97% tariff"" by Cambodia is in reality the fact that we export 97% less stuff to Cambodia than they export to us.

EDIT: The minimum 10% seems to have been applied when the trade balance ratio calculation resulted in a number lower than that, even if we actually have a trade *surplus* with that country.",11992,913,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1jq1qji/trumps_tariff_numbers_are_just_trade_balance/,all,Unknown,0.97

1kabhux,2025-04-28,2025-04-28 20:51:34,"We are literally watching the US Economy collapsing right before our eyes, here is a step by step play","Trump slaps 145% tariffs on China:

1) China inks a deal with Brazil to buy their soybeans. China dropped its US soybean orders to just 1,800 tons’ worth in the week ending April 17 – down massively from 72,800 tons purchased the week before, (Source: USDA)

2) China inks a deal with Spain (and other EU countries) to buy their Pork.  China then cancels a shipment of 12,000 tons of pork from the USA

3) trucking companies lay off drivers who transport goods from the farms to the ports. Independent truckers can't get jobs.

4) Longshoremen are now out of work from cancelled sailings and from the fact that China cancelled all terminal deliveries of Chinese vessels because Trump slapped them with a port fee. 

5) The majority of Christmas toys come from China. There will be bare shelves for Christmas as the shipments are due to sail in 2 months time.  Toy companies, warehouses, and trucking are hit with layoffs as the warehouses will be bare.

6) Germany announced that they move their gold reserve from USA to Switzerland. 30 countries house their gold in the USA but now this is in question as the US economy is in question for stability. 

7) The US dollar is falling. And that’s a bit odd. Because this is happening at a time when US bond yields are rising. Normally you’d see both these things lifting the dollar. Also, when the world gets risky, global investors usually rush to the US. They buy US government bonds, convert their currencies into dollars. The dollar gets stronger. That’s how it’s  always worked. But that’s not what we’re seeing this time. Investors are swapping the dollar assets they hold for anything else — gold and even Japanese and European bonds. Basically, the dollar is losing its safe-haven status.

There will be no quick fix for this as the slide of the US Economy continues to build momentum and mass layoffs begin.

UPDATE: Many of you are just looking at only China but Trump slapped tariffs on the entire world (except Russia, Belarus, and North Korea). China is the example to a greater exodus from the US market.

UPDATE #2 -U.S. employers posted 7.2 million vacancies in March, down from 7.5 million in February and 8.1 million in March 2024. It was the fewest number of openings since September and below the 7.5 million that economists had forecast. (SOURCE: WashingtonPost).

UPDATE #3 - The US Economy shrunk 0.03%   (SOURCE: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/gdp-q1-2025-.html ). So, we only need to see that the 2nd quarter shrinks and then the US is officially in a recession. No?

We're talking about how the economic news matters to regular people: prices, interest rates, saving, and jobs. And we're not afraid to have some fun with it....

In our first episode – Shutdown S\*\*tshow – we discuss how the US shutdown is a symptom of larger fiscal problems that have spread to several major economies. These problems have big implications for future inflation and the value of your savings.

While I explain the macro policy picture, Jason offers an unsentimental perspective from the markets, and Jeremy keeps us both grounded. We're all focused on what the news means to you, not some billionaire planning their next trip to Pluto.

You can find Gross Domestic Provocation on Apple, Spotify, and other major platforms. Links are below. Please share and let us know what you think – feedback, questions, and suggestions are very welcome. We hope you enjoy!

1ny86iw,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 18:58:01,What would happen to Australian savings/investments if the US dollar defaults?,"Good day everyone,

I have a pressing question. With all of the news going around that the US dollar might default with the implementation of a new (digital?) currency, if this were to happen, how would this impact us in Australia? Specifically, how would it impact the value of our dollar and, subsequently, the value of our investments and savings that are based in the Aussie dollar and Aussie market? 

I don't want to live in fear, but I need to plan for a worst-case scenario. I a mostly blind and my mother's caretaker (we moved to Australia a few years ago), so I cannot, like most others in the world, afford to lose all the value of my money as it would devastate our future. I have been diversifying investments into non-Us and non-Aussie etfs, e.g., into European and Asian markets, into gold. But I do have the majority invested in Australia and ones that overlap with the US. So I want to build a long-term strategy that can account for both the best-case and worst-case scenarios.

I am aware that no one knows for certain what will happen, but I believe it is essential that we are cautious and prepared. Any informed insight and advice would be greatly appreocated. 

Thank you. ",1,2,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1ny86iw/what_would_happen_to_australian/,new,Unknown,0.6

The app listens to your voice and gives feedback on confidence, clarity, and tone. You can practice public speaking, mock interviews, or everyday conversation.

It’s been exciting to see people use it in ways I didn’t expect — like practicing pitches, conversations with friends, even dates.

I’m curious what the community thinks:
	•	Would a tool like this feel genuinely useful, or is it just a novelty?
	•	How do you test new apps or tools before fully committing to them?
	•	Any tips for getting honest early feedback from users?

***Photo above*** *– 81 year old Larry Ellison (founder of Oracle) saw his personal fortune soar $100 billion in a single day last month, when he teased that his company might have too many AI orders to fill on time. Accompanying octogenarian Ellison is Irina Osipova, a Ukrainian model who he began dating when she was 19.*  
  
Whenever corporate America decides that enormous scale is their only option, does disaster invariably follow? Was the 2008 housing crash caused by Wall Street and too-big-to fail-banks believing their best idea was jumping into the zero-down mortgages to bad FICO score applicants? Was the [dot.com](http://dot.com) crash caused by everyone believing that everything with “com” in its name was to die for, despite having zero profits? What should we expect next of the 7 AI companies on which much of the stock market value is underpinned?  
  
Do you feel safer, or get more worried, if you hear that the S&P 500 is valued (market cap) at nearly 4 times what the America’s entire GDP is? Should i be more concerned about egg inflation, or stock market inflation?  
  
The normal P/E ratio (price to earnings ratio) for a company’s stock is 10-15. (If you need the price-earnings 101 introductory course, please, google it.). How are the magnificent 7 AI stocks doing on that basis? NVDA is at 50 P/E. It has a market capitalization of $5 Trillion (with a T). Microsoft has a market cap of $4 trillion, and a P/E of 40. Apple also has a market cap of $4 trillion, and P/E of 40. Google (Alphabet) has a market cap of $3 trillion, and P/E of 30 – apparently, they’re a laggard ? Meta, Amazon, Oracle . . . the list goes on. Oracle’s company value rose **$200 billion IN ONE DAY,** and their PE is now 70. The trigger for this explosion? Founder Larry Ellison said they have a backlog of orders.  
  
Remember when [AOL.com](http://AOL.com), Ebay, and Geocities were must-have stocks?  
  
My hope is that all these high-flying AI stocks announce ever more fantastic products/updates. And these products are all excellent, and attract millions of satisfied users. That all the 7 survive, and our retirement accounts are not shot to pieces because we are invested in S&P 500 mutual funds, which is like buying AI as our main investment.  
  
I also had a dream that one day that America would reduce its $37 Trillion national debt, build affordable housing, and return the Social Security Trust fund to solvency. We all have dreams, right?  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

Theory in short: Tie US treasuries to stable coins THEN massively reduce the value of cryptocurrencies through regulation, propaganda, and severing ties to the treasury.

In other words a “rug pull” which is exactly how Russia framed it and it makes perfect sense to me. US debt is greater than 100% of the GDP, when Nixon pulled his stunt, it was only around 30%.

It’s all printed imaginary money propped up by pure faith. The more they print the less valuable our money becomes. The less valuable our money becomes the more we lose faith. So it seems like actions like this WOULD be crucial to sustain the economy. Especially makes sense if they have access to real numbers on job growth and employment while keeping us in the dark so that we will not panic.

I have my car parked elsewhere away from the storefront as to not arose suspicion. Anyway, I was able to hide under the sheets for the entire night. Before opening, I hid in one of the beautiful full sized cabinets. No one noticed me. I ate breakfast in the Swedish restaurant, and subsequently washed up in the bathrooms in the downstairs corner. I’ve been doing this for about two weeks now, saving a lot in rent in the mean time. However, I’ve had a few close calls. It started when I got addicted to the Swedish meatballs. In short, I got super plugged up, and started farting like crazy. Night time security almost caught me mid fart, so I had to hold a painful gassy one for 30 minutes. Luckily, the guard had fallen asleep in another corner of the store so they didn’t hear me erupt. Does anyone have any suggestions on where else to hide? I think they’re on to me after my farting escapade last Thursday.

Because if they had the same amount of children as their parents did, the costs of everything related to childcare (schools, college, medical, women staying at home etc.) would be much higher. Since they were such a large group, the effects of less people entering the workforce could easily be covered with migration.
I‘m a Millenial, my generation has even less kids. But the scheme doesn‘t seem to be working anymore. Would it financially be even possible, that our generation had as many children as required?
I feel like the wealth of the boomer generation and every generation after is more like a loan, we should have invested much more but spent it all on consumer products and cruise ship trips. And now this scheme doesn‘t work anymore, because we have less people entering the workforce but more entering the retiree group. Additionally,  migration with well educated people doesn‘t seem to be working forever.

I was curious to know how these festivals impacted the local economy, since music festivals on the whole are struggling to stay in production and, sheeeesh, we are talking $300 million +

***Photo above*** *- Student protestors at the University of California are demanding free tuition. Governor Newsom is threatening to withhold $45 billion in existing funding. Can you predict how this will end?*  
  
**President Trump** \- *“Do as I say, or I’ll cancel your university funding!”*  
  
**Governor Newsom** – “*Me too. I mean, if you do what Trump sez, then I'm gonna cancel the state university funding.”*  
  
This is really happening. See link to San Francisco Chronicle, at bottom  
  
This is a power struggle for sure. Will Trump keep his word, and pursue his anti-woke, anti-antisemitism, anti-illegal alien student agenda?  
  
Or will Newsom get overruled by his state legislature? They might say *“Okay . . . enough with your 2028 campaign posturing. We are so NOT closing down all our colleges and universities. Take a deep breath, okay?“*  
  
This is a battle Newsom might lose. This does not mean I endorse Trump’s university viewpoints. Even if I understood them, and they weren’t changing day by day like tariffs (I just found the Apple iPad Air is exempt from tariffs even though it's assembled in Chengdu China, whose 5 auto plants are buried under those new tariffs).  
  
As far as havens from reality like Harvard and Columbia go, the only thing I’m certain of is that I support jailing or expelling students who attack suspected Jews on campus, or are cancelling classes, or who are trashing buildings. Stick to that one, Mr Trump. I don’t view campus unisex bathrooms for consenting adults as that big a deal. Let the pro-Muslim students explain why they want the kind of restrooms which probably offend Allah, while they're delivering a beat down to some guy wearing yarmulke.  
  
We are in day 3 of the US government shutdown. The stock market is still rockin’ it . . . the DOW is up 300+ points this week. The Nikkei Japan index was up nearly 2% yesterday. The London index (FTSE 100) up nearly 1% as well. None of this means that these places endorse our shutdown, or Trump's policies of course. Just that billionaires don’t believe the rhetoric both sides are spewing.  
  
The US government shutdown, like California college funding, isn’t about balancing budgets. It’s a power struggle to assert dominance of political ideology.  
  
It might be better to stay focused on the economics. Does anybody believe a $37 trillion national debt is sane? How about $45,000 tuition to the University of California? That’s like buying a Tesla Model Y and driving it off a cliff every year, for 4 years.  
  
We can have anything we want in America, as long as we can pay for. We can’t print fake money endlessly for things which most people don't understand or use.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

The big ugly fundamentally altered the priorities of the United States government. It cut about $1tn from healthcare programs, including Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, meaning that health insurance premiums for tens of millions of Americans will soar starting in January.

According to fool49:

It should be not a requirement to have health insurance, as it is now. If people get sick, they should be offered the option of free euthanasia. In India healthcare is corrupt, with false diagnosis, leading to unnecessary treatment and expenses. Furthermore it serves as a front for the authorities and their security services, to detain and torture people.

Yield curve: Historically one of the best predictors. Right now, the 10y–2y spread is positive (~+55bps), so it doesn’t scream “imminent recession.” The NY Fed model pegs 12-month odds around 20–30%.

Labor market: Unemployment has ticked up to ~4.3%, and hiring is slowing, but we’re not in freefall.

Inflation + Fed policy: Inflation is ~2.7–2.9%, and the Fed is shifting toward cuts, which usually reduces recession risk.

Debt + markets: Household debt is at record highs (~$18.4T), corporate leverage is heavy, and equities are at record valuations. This makes the system fragile — a small shock could tip it over.

So depending on which lens you use, you could argue:

Soft landing: <20% chance of recession.

Baseline slowdown: 25–35% chance, mild downturn.

Fragile system / shock-sensitive: >35% chance if leverage meets a trigger event.

My working view: ~30% probability of recession in the next 12 months, ~10–15% chance of a deeper/severe one.

What do you think is the most underappreciated factor in current recession risk? Is the yield curve still trustworthy in the QE/post-COVID era? Or are debt and asset bubbles the real ticking bomb?",0,7,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nwu27h/how_likely_is_a_us_recession_in_the_next_12/,new,Unknown,0.33

1nwt3ga,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 04:03:08,"NASA can be competitive with private companies, especially for more complex and scientifically innovative projects","According to FT:

Industry-built spacecraft were indeed cheaper, but only for lower-risk projects: the so-called Class C and D missions, where the scientific stakes are modest and the chance of failure is acceptable. Once the analysis moved up to Class A and B missions, the high-profile, flagship science projects where budgets balloon and timelines stretch, the difference evaporated. Nasa and industry came out roughly equal. In some cases, Nasa was cheaper.

According to fool49:

This article challenges the wisdom that private space companies are always overwhelmingly cheaper or more efficient, as compared to NASA. However it does confirm that for the simplest spacecraft private companies are cheaper. For the most complex projects NASA is competitive. You just have to think of all the failures and ballooning costs of Starship. 

And the government is involved even in the private economy. They develop many technologies, which private players get for free. Government agencies provide short to long term contracts and funding for private companies. Long term projects that require high R&D spending, requires parties that have patience and long term capital.

In addition the article explains that most space startups have failed, as most new businesses fail. And that having alternative suppliers of space launch systems, lowers risk and provides redundancy.

Offshore dollar credit exploded in the 2000s as global banks recycled U.S. deficits into loans abroad, embedding the dollar into every balance sheet from Brazil to Korea.

After the financial crisis, official liquidity backstops kept the system alive, though growth in offshore credit slowed even as the U.S. trade deficit deepened again. The pandemic brought another burst of dollar lending, reflecting both emergency funding and risk‑taking during stimulus, but, since 2022, the expansion has faltered while America’s external deficit has widened to historic extremes.

The divergence tells a structural story in that global demand for dollar funding is no longer scaling at the pace of U.S. external borrowing needs, tightening the hinge that connects Wall Street liquidity to Main Street trade flows.

And here we are, 3 years after that, and the National Debt is now $37.5 trillion dollars, well on its way to hit $40 trillion even faster than it hit $30 trillion.

What has caused America to get so far in debt, initially?

And what caused it to exponentially increase? It took 27 years to gain $9 trillion in debt at first, and then it only took 17 years after that to grow an additional $27.5 trillion dollars.

What should America do to limit the exponential growth?",47,134,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nwd4p7/how_does_america_dig_its_way_out_of_its_debt_and/,new,Unknown,0.78

1nw6e9k,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 11:08:52,Implications of a stock market detached from reality.,"I know that there's been a lot of posts about an overvalued stock market and a ""stock market bubble"" but I'm looking for opinions and serious discussion about what the implications to the economy are and what it actually means for everyday Americans.

My own view is that we are in a bubble, and that things may end badly.

Part 1: Are we in a stock market bubble? Many factors indicate yes.

* [Shiller PE ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe): now at levels only seen once before—the dot-com bubble.
* [Buffett indicator](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp-the-buffett-indicator/) (Market Cap / GDP): soaring past its all-time high.
* Extreme Valuations: e.g Palantir is trading at a 600+ PE ratio.
* Tech has risen nearly 50% since the April lows.

Part 2: What it means

Obviously, a growing stock market is generally a good thing, both for the country, as well as for the individuals invested in it. However, I am increasingly seeing a disconnect between the valuations and the state of the economy

* Job growth is at the lowest level in 15 years and unemployment rate is at the highest this year ([source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jobs-report-today-august-2025-three-takeways-federal-reserve/))
* US Dollar is continuously weakening (and projected to weaken more amidst fed rate cuts)
* Tariffs are at an all time high (maybe related to [0.4% MoM inflation](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/09/11/BLS-Consumer-Price-Index-inflation-joblessness/6251757604128/) in August which is still stick) 
* The government shutdown, and [gdp taking a hit ](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/bessent-shutdown-gdp.html)

Everyone likes seeing their stock portfolio go up, but what does it mean for the US economy if the underlying value is not there? QQQ took over 15 years to rereach its high of $118 after the dot com crash. On the one hand, prices today are this elevated because more Americans are invested in the stock market than ever before (and by a lot). On the other hand, this means that a crash will have the most widespread impact on Americans in history. I think we could be living in an unprecedented time and would like to hear everyone's thoughts on the best case as well as the worst case.

1nw3fqp,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 09:13:38,Poland launches deposit-refund system for drinks bottles and cans,"Poland has today launched a nationwide deposit-refund system for plastic bottles and metal cans, with the aim of ensuring more such packaging is recycled. Glass bottles will also soon be added to the scheme.

The system, similar to others already operating in many European countries, requires consumers to pay a deposit as part of the price when purchasing products in such containers. The deposit is then returned to them when they bring the packaging back to the store or another collection point.



For plastic bottles up to three litres in capacity and metal cans up to one litre, the deposit is 0.5 zloty (€0.12). For reusable glass bottles up to a capacity of 1.5 litres, the deposit will be 1 zloty from January 2026.

Containers covered by the scheme will have a special logo on them saying “kaucja” (meaning “deposit”) and the size of the deposit.

However, the climate and environment ministry notes that drinks with such markings will only appear gradually over the coming months, as producers and stores sell down existing stock and introduce the new packaging. Items without the logo will not be eligible for deposits.



After use, packaging with the deposit logo can be returned to any store over 200m² in size that sells beverages in deposit-refundable packaging; shops smaller than 200m² that sell drinks in reusable glass bottles; or any other stores that choose to join the system.

In stores, deposit returns can be handled either by employees or by automated machines. Meanwhile, there will also be automatic deposit machines placed outside some stores, while each of Poland’s almost 2,500 administrative districts (*gminy*) will have at least one public collection point.

No receipt or other proof of purchase is needed in order to return packaging. However, the climate and environment ministry, which is responsible for the system, emphasises that containers should not be crushed or damaged in any other way before being returned.

It is also possible for individual beverage producers to decide not to participate in the system, and instead to pay a fee themselves directly rather than collecting deposits for their packaging.



“The deposit-refund system is one of the steps that will allow us to achieve important environmental goals,” says deputy climate and environment minister Anita Sowińska. “We all want clean forests and beaches. We want our rivers, lakes and seas not to be filled with tonnes of plastic.”

Plans for the system were first [announced](https://notesfrompoland.com/2021/04/09/polish-government-plans-deposit-system-for-plastic-and-glass-bottles/) in 2021. The following year, the then government said it hoped to [launch the system in 2023](https://notesfrompoland.com/2022/06/03/poland-to-introduce-deposit-system-for-recycling-bottles-and-cans-next-year/). However, the process was subsequently [repeatedly delayed](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/04/11/delay-in-recycling-deposit-system-will-cost-poland-billions-in-eu-charges-warns-industry/) amid political wrangling and industry lobbying.

Now that the system is in place, it is likely to take Poles some time to get used to how it works – and get into the habit of saving and returning their bottles and cans.

An opinion poll by the IBRiS agency published last week by the Polish Press Agency (PAP) found that only 47% of Poles say they understand how the system works. A further quarter said they had heard of the idea but were unfamiliar with the details, while over a quarter had not even heard of it.",1,0,0,economy,reddit,https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/10/01/poland-launches-deposit-refund-system-for-drinks-bottles-and-cans/,new,Unknown,0.67

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.

According to fool49:

OpenAI has overtaken SpaceX to become the most valuable private company in the world. As a kid I was very interested in computers and AI, and space and space travel and exploration. So I am very happy about the recent progress in generative AI, and private space companies. 

But SpaceX is an older and more mature company with 2 to 3 times the sales revenue of OpenAI. OpenAI is a software company, while SpaceX is a space hardware company.

I am not sure, but both have long term objectives. SpaceX: making humans a multi planetary species, including Mars. OpenAI: artificial general or super intelligence, though they may be more focused on incremental innovations like Agentic AI.

***Photo above*** *- During World War 2 cars and trucks were modified to run on coal, as an alternative fuel.*  
  
The docents and dowagers named Ford must be turning over in their graves right now. Ford Motor Company's CEO – Jim Farley - is presiding over a 50% drop in stock price. From $27 in 2022, when he ascended to the corner office, to $12 today. Ford’s 1 year future “target price” as estimated by Wall Street pro's is a further decline to $11.  
  
How could this happen?  
  
Mr. Farley blames “pesky” customers for not flocking to his $100,000 Ford F150 Lightning pickups (platinum trim). If $100K sounds insane, you can get a less heroic trim EV F150 for only $75,000. See link below. Okay, I can see a couple of problems here, Mr. Farley.  
  
First, somebody in accounting may have told you that EV tax rebates continue forever and would rise from $7,500 to $12,000. As long as the assembly line churning them out was staffed by UAW members. Various people in DC were talking this up, as if they could just print money endlessly.  
  
Second, somebody in Ford's sales department may have misplaced a digit, and overestimated the market size for $100,000 pickups. Electric vehicles are a thing with coastal elites. Those locations have the charging infrastructure. Farmers in Kansas? Not so much. If a farmer runs short on electrons, it could be a long way back to barn to plug in.  
  
So Ford is pivoting to hybrids, a decade after Honda and Toyota figured out this was the answer to range anxiety. Apparently, all new Ford, GM and Ram pickups will be hybrids. It’s not certain if they will still be “flex fuel”, and able to run on 85% ethanol. This was one of the byproducts of the 1992 Energy Policy Act. Almost immediately refineries began churning out more than 1 billion gallons of ethanol a year, as a consequence of government handouts to corn farmers. Even though there are actually almost zero filling stations where you can get E85. E85 capability became a feature, not a bug. on new pickup truck window stickers.  
  
As usual, I’m dissatisfied. I don’t want to throw tax money at farmers to produce ethanol instead of food for my dinner table. I don’t want perpetual tax incentives on $100,000 electric pickup trucks simply because someone covets UAW votes. I don’t want to wake up tomorrow and read that someone else has patented a pickup truck that runs on coal, and there’s a tax incentive on THAT now . . .  
  
Mr. Farley, you’re not the first CEO to get bamboozled by congress, your accountants, and your sales department. But Ford stock HAS declined 50% over the past couple of years. And you're almost 65 years old. Maybe this would be a good time to start retirement planning?  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

However with the new GST tax regime, luxury watches may face a high sales tax of 40% - but lower tariffs.

The Indians are allies of USA, as they share common values and interests, and a common enemy in China. So while things may look bad in the short term and in the press, eventually they will reach a mutually beneficial trade agreement. 

And EU will not want to be left behind, so they have been negotiating for about 18 years - let us hope that the EFTA agreement incentivises the EU to complete a trade agreement with India.

1nvo28i,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 19:29:39,Forget the H-1B Debate: Offshore Labor Is Stomping the U.S. IT Economy.,"I totally get the $100K fee for new H-1B workers. If companies are going to bring in talent from abroad, they'll make sure to pick the best of the best, but we’re missing the bigger picture: **we’re regulating the people who come here to work, while completely ignoring the massive amount of software development that’s being outsourced overseas.**

While we’re focused on regulating visa salaries, offshore labor now makes up nearly half of all software development in mid-to-large U.S. tech companies. **That’s millions of IT jobs and billions of dollars flowing out of the country** to India, Latin America, and Eastern Europe, while thousands of U.S. developers are getting laid off. On top of that, it's billions of dollars in lost tax revenue every year, money that is not being collected to fund the needs of the country.

[Average Annual Cost to Hire Offshore Developers \(2025\)](https://preview.redd.it/5fv2av3j1lsf1.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4b95ec30aca542fa05cfd696aa66d1e5b1cbfe9)

So, **why not impose tariffs/taxes on overseas labor**? We already do this with physical goods, **even basic necessities like food** facing tariffs of 20%, 50%, **even more than 100%** depending on origin.

Meanwhile, companies can outsource half their software development to overseas teams with **zero equivalent penalty**. No tariffs. No accountability. Just cheaper labor and bigger margins, while thousands of U.S. developers get laid off.

Look again at that table above and make the math, you pick whatever percentage you think is fair... and just for reference, there is a **250% tariff on Dairy products** (yes, like Milk and Cheese) imported from Canada.

>!My personal take would be to stop treating developers like rock stars and progressively align their salaries with other engineering fields, but at the same time heavily tax offshore labor to make local hiring attractive again. After months of unemployment, I doubt many developers would complain about a more reasonable salary when the alternative is no job at all.!<",0,4,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nvo28i/forget_the_h1b_debate_offshore_labor_is_stomping/,new,Unknown,0.5

1nvlyca,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 18:01:13,The falling foreign share of Treasuries and the Fed’s oscillating dominance show that U.S. debt absorption has moved from global savings toward central bank balance sheet management.,"The split between central bank balance sheet demand and foreign demand is ultimately the fulcrum of the Treasury market. Foreign ownership peaked just after the Great Recession, when recycling of U.S. current‑account deficits through official reserves made Treasuries the global savings sink. That structural bid has eroded as reserve accumulation plateaued, China diversified and oil exporters drew down savings.

The Fed filled the vacuum, first through QE waves that pulled its share to historic highs, then through QT phases that temporarily ceded ground before being forced back in by stress.

The recent picture shows a secular handoff, with the foreign share grinding lower while the Fed’s share oscillates around policy cycles. That means the Treasury market’s marginal buyer is no longer external surplus countries but the central bank managing domestic liquidity and collateral.

This, in turn, ties debt sustainability to policy credibility, makes the system more reflexive and leaves global linkages weaker.

***Photo above*** *- this is NOT the Versailles Palace, built for French King Louis XIV. It's the Pennsylvania capitol building in Harrisburg, where politicians are debating how to balance the state budget. Can you see the forest, guys?*  
  
Wow, for a guy (allegedly) running for president in 2028,, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro seems determined to tank his chances before the first debate even takes place. Because neither the Democrat controlled Pennsylvania state house or Republican controlled state senate can agree on a budget, so Shapiro’s solution is stop showing them relevant expense data. *“Your only job is to pass the budget. Just do it.*” (actual quote - see link below).  
  
I don’t think Shapiro is inspired by Trump here, although there are eerie parallels between the Federal budget (we just started a federal shutdown this morning) and Pennsylvania’s attempt to rein in their own out of control expenses. The highest paid state employee is apparently a guy named “James Grossman” earning $500,000. James flew under the radar until earlier this year. He’s the teachers pension fund administrator, and he earns twice as much as Governor Shapiro, who himself is apparently the highest paid governor in America.  
  
If you think the head teachers' pension fund guy SHOULD be paid a lot, I won’t debate this on Glassdoor metrics. But I will point out that Pencilvania's pension fund has been underfunded for 15 years (obligations far exceed assets) and would have been declared bankrupt if it weren't a government agency. If it were a bank, the FDIC would have closed the doors and liquidated it. Eventually this pension balloon is going to burst, probably requiring a state bailout.  
  
So maybe $500,000 a year to decide to run the pension fund’s $72 billion investment fund is fair. I'd do it for that salary, for sure. And - in the interest of public policy transparency - I would have put the whole shebang in an S&P 500 municipal fund. It would have earned 13.7% compounded return on average every year since 2010. The fund assets would be 600% higher than where they started in 2010. This would be WAAAAY more than Mr. Grossman was getting from the esoteric mix of “fixed income and corporate debt"" holdings being pushed on him by wall street smarties earning sales commissions.  
  
The answer to government budget problems isn’t to declare government salaries off limits for review, or officials’ free cars, or how much it will cost to refurbish the state capitol building in Harrisburg, with its 282 foot, 52 million pound dome. Hiding overspending never works. I really cannot give Shapiro, or Newsom, or AOC, or Pritzker a thumbs up for the 2028 presidential nomination. Just like the current president, they're all instinctive liars and over spenders.  
  
I’m just sayin' . . .

Key takeaways:

Workday is embedding AI into HR, finance, and analytics – helping businesses cut inefficiencies and make faster decisions.

This AI adoption is being seen as a blueprint for growth in enterprise software.

Early investors who spotted this trend benefited big.

It got me thinking – Workday isn’t alone. Similar companies leveraging cloud + AI (especially in HR tech, fintech, enterprise tools) could be the next breakout stocks.

Toyota and its Japanese peers have been slow to put high-tech EVs similar to those provided by BYD on the market, creating doubts over whether they can ever catch up. Auto industry insiders see a fundamental problem in the development speed for new models, which Masato Shoji, partner at Deloitte Tohmatsu in Tokyo, estimates to be six to seven years for Japan’s car producers compared with 18 months for some Chinese peers...

...""The one concern I have is software and autonomous driving technology,” says Yuzawa, who describes the Japanese groups’ slow progress as a risk rather than an immediate threat.

According to fool49:

Chinese not only have superior technology, they also have a superior much faster product development process. I don't see how Japan can catch up in EVs and SDVs, unless they change their business model. Right now Japan has large protected markets like India, USA, and home. 

But they must not get complacent and only design and build models for such markets, largely protected from Chinese competition. Automotive companies will have to transform, to technology and software companies.

Earlier, President Donald Trump threatened mass ''irreversible"" firings of federal workers if the shutdown went ahead

During the shutdown, the federal government stops all non-essential functions, while employees whose work is deemed essential, such as active-duty military members and federal law enforcement officers, are required to report to work, often without pay.

According to fool49:

Trump is planning to fire thousands of workers. When the government restarts it may be a lot smaller. And I don't think security workers, or anyone else, should have to work without pay. The last time the government shutdown was also during a Trump administration. I don't know if the democrats are being unreasonable and punishing Trump. 

Let us try an experiment on how the country functions without funding or services. I think we can survive without law enforcement. But how secure is the country without military. They shouldn't work if they are not getting paid. Unless the government makes a commitment to pay them for all their labour during the shutdown, when the government restarts.

***Photo above*** *- America's largest surviving coal fired power plant, near Macon Georgia. See the intense orange flames, proving those are NOT nuclear cooling towers? The plant uses 11 million tons of coal annually, all brought by train from Wyoming. That's 1 million railroad cars, if you're keeping count . . .*  
  
I haven’t seen a coal fired electric plant in years. The closest one to me is about an hour south, near Gibsonville Florida, off route 41. Never been there. America has been phasing coal plants out. President Trump wants to change all that. $600 million in taxpayer money will be used to reopen closed coal fired electric plants (see link below).  
  
If I can oppose government handouts for windmills - and billion dollar fusion reactors which don’t actually generate power – I can rant against handouts for coal strip mines and power plants too. More coal is the answer to a question nobody ever asked, except possibly miners in West Virginia and Wyoming.  
  
I’m all for more electricity. During a watch party for the Buccaneers game Sunday we were bombarded with several “AWS” ads – Amazon Web Services. Between AWS and Amazon’s half dozen AI projects there is a LOT of electrical consumption. Jeff Bezos refuses to disclose how much electricity his empire uses, but I’m going to guess it’s considerably more than what could be generated by $600 million worth of remodeled coal plants.  
  
The problem isn’t coal. Or AI, or server farms in general. Or nuclear power plants nearing the end of their useful lives. Or windmills which need to be torn down and thrown into the sea to become artificial reefs after their 25 year life expectancy is reached. Or dams which block rivers and prevent fish from spawning. The problem is that we – as consumers – always insist on more and more electrically powered conveniences, and the cheapest possible KwH cost to run these things.  
  
Remember when we were brainwashed that LED lights were so efficient that they were going to save us from needing new power plants? Government mandates forbade the construction of new homes with incandescent bulbs, and soon they were no longer even for sale at Home Depot. A single 60 watt (equivalent) LED replacement cost $9.99 back then. Hooray, we will earn back the purchase cost over 25 years if we use that bulb 2 hours a day.  
  
Today those same bulbs are available (from Amazon) for 90 cents each. Down from $9.99 each during the heady government mandate+stop climate change era. I possibly still have some of those $9.99 legacy LED bulbs in some of my lamps. And CFC twist bulbs, too.  
  
Government mandates and giveaways distort markets. Just like the cost of LED bulbs first went over the moon, then eventually came back to earth. Now those refurbished coal plants are going to make someone rich. Our government is picking winners and losers. Someone with a stake in coal has just become a winner, and someone with a stake in wind turbines was a loser earlier this year.  
  
  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

1nub7yy,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 07:59:27,A widening U-6 minus U-3 alongside falling quits shows worker option value fading and wage pressure cooling even as headline unemployment stays tame.,"The gap between U-6 and U-3 unemployment rates fattens when hours are cut, part-timers can’t get full-time work and discouraged workers drift to the sidelines. Quits are the mirror image of that under the skin of the labor market, rising only when workers have credible outside options.

When you put the spread and quits together, you get a clear signal of bargaining power moving through the cycle. The 2002–2007 upswing, for example, narrowed the spread without ever producing an explosive quits impulse, which is why wage growth never truly broke out.

Since the 2022 spike in quits — at which point marked peak worker leverage — the re-balancing has been textbook, with the U-6/U-3 spread drifting wider while quits have slipped toward their pre-2018 range, telling you that the jobs market still creates positions but with thinner option value for workers and a quieter wage-pressure channel.

A wider slack spread with subdued quits implies wage inflation cools even without a hard break in payrolls, which preserves room for disinflation to continue while keeping measured unemployment deceptively calm.",2,0,0,economy,reddit,https://i.redd.it/65cinb3mkasf1.jpeg,new,Unknown,0.75

1nu1q99,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 22:42:52,China official manufacturing PMI shrinks in Sept; Private PMIs positive.,"Chinese manufacturing activity shrank for a sixth consecutive month in September, official purchasing managers index data showed on Tuesday, while service sector activity also weakened. 

But a separate, private PMI survey showed both manufacturing and services activity growing much more than expected in September. 

Manufacturing PMI read 49.8 in September, government data showed. The print was slightly stronger than expectations of 49.6 and the prior month’s reading of 49.4. 

A reading below 50 indicates contraction, with China’s manufacturing sector having shrunk consistently since April this year. 

But private PMI data presented a different picture. The RatingDog China manufacturing PMI grew to 51.2 in September, more than expectations of 50.2 and above last month’s reading of 50.5. 

The print showed manufacturing growth at its strongest level in six months, and reflected a much sharper increase in exports than seen in the government data. 

The RatingDog PMI, formerly the Caixin PMI, differs from the government reading-- while the government print focuses more on bigger, state-run enterprises in the north, the private data covers smaller private enterprises in the south. 

Investors usually use both PMIs to gain a broader picture of the Chinese economy. 

While Tuesday’s readings did show some improvement in September, it still pointed to the manufacturing sector remaining largely under pressure from soft overseas demand, especially in the United States.",3,1,0,economy,reddit,https://uk.investing.com/news/economy-news/china-manufacturing-pmi-shrinks-for-sixth-consecutive-month-in-september-4284291,new,Unknown,1.0

The tariffs are set to apply from Oct. 14, with some increases targeted to take effect Jan. 1, according to a proclamation signed Monday. They follow a Commerce Department investigation into imports of lumber, timber and derivative projects that was launched in March.

Trump said the planned actions will “strengthen supply chains, bolster industrial resilience, create high-quality jobs and increase domestic capacity utilization for wood products.”

Yet home builders have warned they also could deter investments in new houses and renovations. That could blunt the effectiveness of Trump’s high-profile campaign to boost homebuying by encouraging the Fed to lower interest rates.

Canada stands to be hit hard by the order, as it’s by far the US’s largest wood supplier and it’s already subject to 35.2% duties meant to counter alleged subsidies and unfair pricing.

1nu0jsv,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 21:47:29,Shutdown Showdown,"This week will test the market’s ability to separate politics from fundamentals. The immediate driver is the September jobs report, which the Labor Department has warned will be suspended if a government shutdown begins on October 1. That puts traders in a unique bind; markets are forced to hedge not only against the jobs number itself, but also the possibility of no release at all. Historically, shutdowns lasting less than a week create modest equity drawdowns (−1% to −2%), while volatility (VIX) spikes +10–20% before fading once a deal emerges. With Trump openly signaling that Democrats will take the blame, and with both sides entrenched, the odds favor at least a short shutdown of 5–7 days.

For the S&P 500, this suggests a choppy, defensive week with a likely range of −2% to +1%, as investors await political clarity. The Nasdaq may hold up somewhat better, as any softer jobs tone or delay will ease pressure on yields; however, it will remain vulnerable to intraday swings, trading within a −2.5% to +1.5% band. The VIX will be the most telling instrument, expect an initial 8–15% surge early in the week, with the potential for another spike if a shutdown drags past October 3–4, followed by sharp mean reversion if a stopgap deal is reached by the weekend or early next week.

The broader takeaway: volatility is the trade, politics are the driver, and equities will only find footing once Trump can secure a symbolic “win” at home and allow negotiations to resolve.

**TLDR:** This week leans volatile and defensive — S&P 500 and Nasdaq will chop lower, while the VIX surges early before fading if a short shutdown is resolved by October 7–10.",2,6,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nu0jsv/shutdown_showdown/,new,Unknown,0.67

1ntjdwv,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 10:23:58,How do we deal with weak local government?,"A city government with limited resources has access to a local spring that could provide drinking water to tens of thousands of people at a very low cost. The same spring is also sought by a multinational bottling company with extensive legal teams, lobbyists, and campaign funding. The company is in a far stronger position to secure the rights.

Once the contract has been signed, the spring is effectively transferred from a potential public utility to a private input for global distribution. The city remains responsible for infrastructure such as roads, policing, and drought management, but no longer controls the water itself. Small municipalities rarely have the legal expertise or political leverage to demand high fees that reflect full costs.

A single truck driving the bottled water away already has an impact. Engineers measure this with the “equivalent single axle load” (ESAL). A single 80,000-pound semi can cause road damage equivalent to thousands of passenger cars. Now imagine dozens or hundreds of trucks. Even though the company is providing jobs which pay wages. The citizens earning those wages still have to go through local government. Meanwhile the local government won't even earn enough money to fix the roads. 

Citizens can then pay a ~200,000% mark-up to buy a bottle of water, while their roads turn to shit. How do we solve this issue while ""keeping government small"" ? Who is supposed to stand up in favor of the public good? In every single arena where the citizen can demand change, the company has more power. In the courts, in the chambers of power, in the newspapers. Hell, in the next election cycle, the politicians will brag about bringing new jobs to the area. They might even be rewarded for it, while they will now be subsidizing a billion dollar company.

So trade numbers don't give an accurate picture. One should look at value added. Tarrifs on particular countries will not necessarily result in reshoring, it could result in a shift of manufacturing from high tarrifs countries to low tarrifs countries.

1ntg6xz,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 08:05:51,This ratio shows which scarcity is in charge — financial hedging (gold) or physical barrels (oil).,"The crude oil-in-gold ratio is a purity test for scarcity, as it strips out the dollar and tells you whether the market is paying a security premium for financial hedges or a barrel premium for physical tightness.

When one ounce buys many barrels, the bid is in gold (that is, macro hedging, duration fear and liquidity demand), as the chart clearly illustrates, while upstream capacity and efficiency keep oil from commanding scarcity rents.

If, however, one ounce buys fewer barrels, energy tightness is doing the talking and inflation risk is coming from the pump rather than the “printing press.”

As of July 2025, one ounce of gold could buy 48.3 barrels of crude oil. That’s quite elevated, though it pales in comparison to the pandemic-induced 80 mark recorded five years ago.

This ratio outperforms narratives because it forces you to pick which scarcity the market is actually pricing.

Read it as a regime gauge: high barrels-per-ounce says financial anxiety is outrunning physical shortage; low barrels-per-ounce says the constraint is real-world molecules and logistics.

***Photo above*** *- The Simpsons, Season 7, Episode 7. Homer demonstrates a variety of techniques to feign productivity while working from home.*  
  
Let me admit – right from the start – that I don’t expect the mass firings (if they even happen) to make the tiniest dent in the national debt. It will be like a rounding error (less than 0.01%). So why are we even paying any attention to this, if it serves no greater purpose? Americans of all kinds – government workers, the homeless, substance addicts, teachers, first responders, voters in general – we are ALL just bargaining chips to career politicians who are scrambling to get re-elected again and again.  
  
But *“thousands of federal workers are terrified”* that they might lose their jobs. (see link below). Nobody is terrified that housing might become LESS affordable as the national debt soars, or that colleges continue to churn out students with irrelevant degrees who are functionally illiterate. Probably a few people are worried that defunding the police (and FBI, and ICE and homeland security) is going to result in more random shootings. Probably a few people are hoping this happens, as a way to get elected to a vulnerable senate seat.  
  
Let’s focus on the practical aspects of mass government firings, instead of the metaphysical ones. Imagine you were in charge of making a “short list” of people to be fired. (Full disclosure – I have been asked to help with this question a few times in the corporate world). Here are my recommendations, based on experience.  
  
1 – **First in line – anyone with excessive absenteeism and no bonafide medical situation.** This is probably the single biggest tranche of headcount that could be cut at every government level. Most federal, state, and local workers behave like they cannot be fired unless they commit a felony. Absenteeism, insubordination, and petty theft are off the menu as disciplinary triggers. Let’s start with these smirking wisenheimers.  
  
2 – **Those defying repeated “back to the office” mandates**. This applies equally to government and private sector workers. Especially if they have skills which mesh nicely with side hustles: coders, supply chain managers, attorneys, property management, accounting . . . it’s unbelievable how much time these people spend on their second laptop generating their second income, while clocked in. It is important to keep both laptops side by side so you can respond to work emails/texts, attend zoom meetings, etc. and convince everyone that are on the job.  
  
3 – **Vacant positions**. Most people have no idea how lucrative this target is for savings. Any position which has been vacant for longer than 90 days should be eliminated. If you don’t do this, the manager protecting that vacant position will sooner or later fritter it away by hiring a friend, relative, or relative of his/her superiors in the chain of the command. That is the reason that cube is vacant in the first place. The incumbent didn’t do anything vital, and neither will the successor.  
  
4 – **Anything the private sector does with a larger workforce, and for less money.** This is a mind boggling array of jobs. Federal gas stations and attendants for government issued vehicles. Janitorial and trash removal services. Couriers for non-top-secret documents and package delivery. Systems/web management. If you balk at this last one, ask yourself why government agencies get hacked MUCH MORE often than the private sector databases. The difference is that the government doesn’t tell us about those events, because they’re not required to. My mom's local library was hacked and held up for $1 million ransom. The administrators tried to keep it a secret. (Resolution - no ransom was paid and the files were rebuilt over 90 days by the same ""experts"" who allowed the intrusion in the first place)  
  
Okay, if your job appears as part of any of the above items, you probably should be “terrified”, as the article frets. But in reality, don’t worry. There won’t be any mass terminations. Both sides will strike a deal this week, because this is all a kabuki play, and the end game is public perceptions and votes.  
  
Remember, we are all just pawns.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

World models are trained using data streams of real or simulated environments. They are viewed as an important step in pushing forward progress in self-driving cars, robotics and so-called AI agents, but require a huge amount of data and computing power to train and are considered an unsolved technical challenge.

According to fool49:

We are reaching the limits of generative AI and LLMs. As LLMs are trained on most data publicly available. To have a better understanding of the world, AI models need to be trained on multi modal data. World models are the next step in AI. But I didn't read any mention of embodied intelligence. That is when AI is placed in like a robot where the intelligence interacts with a physical environment. With the intelligence including world models.

I think a combination of multi modal generative AI with world models embodied in a robot is the next step. But robots can be very expensive with limited mobility and dexterity, and inability to adapt to unstructured environments. Computing has been coming down in costs while increasing in power following Moores law; data, bandwith, processing power all have been growing exponentially. While progress in robots is much slower, we can only hope that simple humanoid robots become cheap, with mass production, and adoption in homes and businesses. Accelerating progress in intelligent machines.

If the deplorables who fear intelligent machines, don't adopt them, then the lead will be taken by countries more welcoming. Especially in Asian countries like Japan, and China. The Luddites will hold back technological and economic progress with their unreasonable fear of machines.

P.S. Everytime I discuss AI, I get downvoted, so I know most participants in this forum, are biased against AI; I hope AIs take your jobs, and those who are more welcome to AIs prosper.

Australia’s ASX 200 index rose 0.8% with focus chiefly on the conclusion of a two-day Reserve Bank of Australia meeting on Tuesday. Banks and gold stocks were the main boosts to the index. 

The RBA is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged amid recent signs of inflation turning sticky, but could offer up some signals on a potential cut in November. 

“A 25bp cut is more likely in November, taking the policy rate to 3.35% for an extended period,” ANZ analysts said in a recent note, adding that Governor Michele Bullock was widely expected to reiterate the central bank’s data-driven stance on further easing, after about 75 bps of cuts so far in 2025.

And China increasing loans and trade with poorer countries. The US bloc is about 2/3 of global GDP and includes most of the richest and technologically advanced economies. The China bloc is smaller, and includes many authoritarian and poor countries, including countries rich in commodities.

Where does this leave India? The quick answer will be to remain neutral as it did during the cold war. But India can benefit from an alignment with USA. Even as it will become the third largest economy within a decade. It is not interested in projecting power abroad, or leading a bloc of countries. India has a large trade deficit with China, and a small trade surplus with USA. Best is if India remains neutral, but if forced to choose, it would prefer the USA along with EU. For flow of knowledge, goods, capital, and people. And because India shares values and interests with USA.

1nsx98h,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 15:29:13,🚀 Wall Street Radar: Stocks to Watch Next Week - vol 57,"**Weeks That Take Skin**

It was the kind of week that makes you talk to screens. Not prayers, bargains.

We spent most of it hunched over prices like mechanics over a stubborn engine, day‑trading a couple of names just to drag Friday into the green by its collar. Nothing humiliates quite like survival mode. You’re not building, you’re just bailing.

Trust? Thin. We don’t trust this market, and the market knows it.

Full article and watchlist [HERE](https://www.gb.capital/p/wall-street-radar-stocks-to-watch-vol-57)

We’re moving super cautiously, the way you walk across black ice pretending you’re not. Our job is simple and ugly: participate until the gauges light up red, and then breathe, regroup, sharpen. Not before. Not after. When Energy and Utilities are wearing the relative‑strength crown, you don’t whine that the party feels off; you pat your pockets, keep your shoes on, and stay near the door.

The portfolio shifted hard. We raised both **CRWV** and **ENPH** to break‑even stops and got tossed. Right call. They’d been loitering, doing nothing but charging rent on our attention. No harm, no shame. The best trades make you feel clever; the right trades often make you feel nothing.

**ATAI** gave us a head rush: up more than 35% in a blink. We sold 30% into strength like adults and welded the stop to break even. Maybe it holds, maybe it doesn’t. The company’s interesting, the tape says biotech’s one of the few industries not lying to itself. Hope is not a thesis. A stop is.

**OKLO**: We sang our last note on Friday. Seventy‑five percent in short order. You don’t complain about a win like that. You log it, nod once, and refuse the victory lap. Recent best, yes. Proof of immortality, no.

Then there’s **CROX**. Friday’s HeyDude x Sydney Sweeney splash hit, and we slid in, not because celebrity endorsements save souls, but because the risk/reward answered without stuttering. Solid company, heavy shelf of support at 74–75, a clean break of the recent daily downtrend, and volume almost doubled. We took it with a wide stop and a smaller size; this isn’t a two‑day fling if it’s going to matter.

**LTRX** is the bruise you keep pressing. We bought the breakout that never arrived. The stock’s pacing a channel like a caged cat; our thesis dies if it slips the lower rail, and we’re already hearing the lock rattle. We gave it room on purpose, not out of mercy. The room is expensive. So is denial.

Macro mood music: VIX down, T2118 down, T2108 ticking up. The market’s bouncing. In two weeks, we’ll learn if this is a dead‑cat hop into a lower high or the coiling that slings us to fresh records.

Feels fifty‑fifty: an honest coin flip, the most dangerous odds in trading because they whisper that you’re supposed to guess. We won’t. We’ll react.

That’s the whole blueprint, unromantic and true:

* Respect the drift even when it insults you.
* Sell into strength because gravity is patient.
* Put the stop where your thesis ends, not where your feelings begin.
* Trade what’s in front of you, not the story you wanted.

We’ll show up again on Monday with knuckles uncurled and rules intact. If the bounce grows teeth, we’ll feed it. If it rolls under and shows belly, we’ll cut the risk and let it play dead without us.

Either way, no speeches, no hero shots. Just the work, done tight, while the market decides whether this was the week it took skin or the week it taught us how to keep it.",1,0,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nsx98h/wall_street_radar_stocks_to_watch_next_week_vol_57/,new,Unknown,0.67

1nstyj7,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 13:20:03,"Citizens’ budgets are quietly transforming Poland’s cities, towns and villages – and leading the way in Europe","**By Callum MacRae**

Wisława Szymborska Park in Kraków opened just two years ago, but Cracovians have already come to know and love it as a precious area of public green space right at the heart of the city.

And it is Cracovians themselves who are responsible for the creation of the park, which was funded through a so-called “citizens’ budget”, under which residents can propose, discuss and vote on projects to be implemented using municipal funds.

Poland has become a global leader in this kind of participatory budgeting. Today, more than 50% of such schemes in Europe are found in Poland, where participatory budgeting is now mandated by law for every major city and has also been adopted voluntarily in many smaller municipalities.

The result has been the beginnings of a minor revolution in local governance, with the steady spread of citizens’ budgets quietly remaking villages, towns and cities.

# The roots of citizens’ budgets in Poland

Poland’s experiment with participatory budgets began in 2009 with the Solecki Fund. While such schemes are most often conceived in the urban context, the Solecki Fund was targeted at small rural administrative units (in Polish: *sołectwa*), allowing them to request that a portion of the local budget be allocated to participatory budgeting.

The programme saw [considerable success in its initial years](http://funduszesoleckie.pl/index.html@p=457.html) (almost half of those eligible made use of the scheme in its first year), and continues to shape local governance in rural Poland, with [around two thirds](https://www.gwsh.pl/content/biblioteka/org/zeszyty/ag/zn20/ZN20AG_11Wojewodzic.pdf#:~:text=Field%20research%20conducted%20in%202023%20and%202024,of%20life%20in%20rural%20and%20urban%20areas.) of the country’s almost 41,000 *sołectwa* today incorporating some form of participatory budgeting under the Solecki Fund.



With the precedent set at the rural level, participatory budgeting soon spread to urban government after Sopot introduced the first city-level citizens’ budget scheme in 2011.

“Slowly, more cities began implementing it as a form of civic celebration, as councillors in municipal and city councils demanded participatory budgets,” says Jarosław Kempa, an economist at the University of Gdańsk and a member of Sopot city council since the introduction of the original scheme in 2011.

From 2014 to 2019, the number of cities and towns running some form of participatory budget [grew almost tenfold](https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/pp/article/view/46722/38233), from 35 to 320. When in 2019 citizens’ budgets became a statutory obligation for all cities with urban district (*powiat*) status, for most this was a matter of legal frameworks playing catch-up.

The schemes are even popular in towns where the legal requirement does not apply – in 2022, [43.5% of municipalities with a population greater than 5,000](https://obserwatorium.miasta.pl/biblioteka/barometr-budzetu-obywatelskiego-edycja-2022/) implemented a citizens’ budget.

# The impact of citizens’ budgets

Across the past 15 years, citizens’ budgets have become a powerful means for local democratic engagement in Poland.

“The initiative to establish a participatory budget in Sopot was an attempt by local government to offer pragmatic dialogue and engage the local community in the decision-making process,” says Artur Roland Kozłowski, a political theorist at WSB Merito University in Gdańsk. As the schemes spread after Sopot’s success, they became “a tool for genuine social activation and inclusion”.

Wisława Szymborska Park is a powerful symbol of the potential of these schemes to transform local economic decision-making.

Until 2019, when the proposal to build the park was submitted, the land on which it now sits was a (poorly kept) car park. The citizens’ budget gave residents of Kraków the opportunity – in a city [plagued by some of the worst air quality levels in Europe](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/12/07/polish-city-records-worlds-second-highest-air-pollution-as-winter-smog-sets-in/) – to consider how else they might like that land to be used.



Moreover, this symbolic power is only heightened by the presence of the former site of Dolne Młyny – once a popular hub for bars, restaurants and exhibition spaces located in a former tobacco factory – which sits across a street to the west of the park.

Despite concerted local opposition, the investors who owned the land on which Dolne Młyny sat [evicted the tenants in 2020](https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/09/18/krakows-post-industrial-nightlife-and-culture-hub-forced-to-close-as-developers-move-in/), with plans to build a luxury apartment and hotel complex that are yet to materialise.

Sitting amid the tranquil trees of the park and gazing across the road, the contrast can feel stark. On one side of the street, citizens have come together to turn a rundown car park into a thriving and much-needed public park.

On the other, the wishes of the local community were circumvented, and a well-loved cultural and entertainment space made way for (yet more) [unaffordable housing](https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/09/02/warsaw-now-more-expensive-than-rome-as-poland-sees-europes-fastest-house-price-rises-in-2024/).



Furthermore, Wisława Szymborska Park is just one of an ever-growing list of participatory budgeting success stories from across Poland: repairs to roads and pavements, new parks, more trees, cycle paths, sporting events and training sessions, public concerts, classes and workshops.

As a resident of Kraków, I frequently make use of citizens’ budget-funded parks, I train and race twice weekly with a citizens’ budget-funded running club, and I witness regular citizens’ budget-funded improvements to basic infrastructure in my local neighbourhood.

In 2024, [163 different projects were funded in Kraków](https://budzet.krakow.pl/aktualnosci/288152,1909,komunikat,wyniki_glosowania_2024.html), from an original list of 1,100 proposals, with a total of 46 million zł (€10.8 million) allocated for implementation.

Taken together, such amenities constitute the lived environment that forms the backdrop against which our lives unfold. Through the citizens’ budgets, residents of Poland are increasingly afforded the opportunity to shape this backdrop to better meet their needs and wants.

# Poland is setting the example in Europe

Interest in participatory budgeting has not been confined only to Poland in recent years. But the extent to which these schemes have become a systematised part of local governance marks the country out from its EU neighbours and beyond.

“Probably nowhere else in the world has this idea permeated such a wide cross-section of different communities and types of administration,” explains Kamil Orzechowski, CEO of Mediapark, a company that develops digital platforms to support local governments in collecting citizens’ budget project submissions and conducting votes.

“The idea of participatory budgeting in Poland has gone far beyond the standard approach, from the micro to the macro scale, from small villages and municipalities with a few thousand inhabitants, to towns, cities, and even entire provinces.”



Orzechowski attributes some of this remarkable success to the idiosyncrasies of Poland’s local government structures, particularly a series of reforms in the 1990s which gave municipalities and cities broad powers over their own budgets.

“The participatory budget was therefore not an empty gesture: it gave citizens the opportunity to make real decisions about the distribution of real money,” he says.

But some of the credit must also go to those residents who participate in the schemes, often in impressive numbers.

“The example of Częstochowa, where 800 projects were in 2024 submitted in a town of approximately 200,000 inhabitants, is astonishing,” Orzechowski notes, adding that statistically, that means there was one idea for every 250 inhabitants.

# There is still room for Poland’s citizens’ budgets to expand

Despite these successes, the Polish scheme is not without its limitations. Most obviously, when compared with some participatory budgeting in other countries, Poland’s citizens’ budgets cover a relatively limited amount of local government finance – generally under 2% of the total budget.

Polish law requires a minimum of only 0.5% of the total budget to be allocated, whereas in Brazil – whose Porto Alegre scheme is often credited as the beginning of the modern participatory budget movement – the figure is [typically between 2 and 10%](https://partycypacjaobywatelska.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/faqqpp.pdf), and in some cases even higher.



Moreover, though the extent of their proliferation through Polish society has been impressive, there is still room for more growth. Putting aside larger *powiat* cities, far fewer of Poland’s smaller municipalities (*gminy*) currently implement citizens’ budgets.

“Participatory budgets have been implemented in approximately 13% of *gminy*, or around 320 out of 2,477,” Kozłowski explains. “The need to introduce mandatory participatory budgets in municipalities and cities without *powiat* status should be considered.”

Though these limitations are significant, the existing legal infrastructure creates a national framework for future reforms – so long as the political will exists to implement them. And, as Kozłowski points out, this will depend on who is in government at the national level.

“Increasing the size of participatory budgets requires a stable financial policy from the central government, which was not forthcoming under \[former ruling party\] Law and Justice (PiS),” he says, adding that their “focus on limiting local government funding served to undermine openness to increasing the size” of citizens’ budgets.

# An optimistic vision of Poland’s economic future

As well as providing a clear institutional pathway to extending the policy, the success of existing citizens’ budgets illustrates why more ambitious schemes are worth fighting for.

In Kraków, as one passes the boarded-up development site of Dolne Młyny and enters the peaceful gardens of Wisława Szymborska Park, two different visions of how Poland’s economy might work in the coming decades are offered – one in which unaccountable investors call the shots, and one in which important funding decisions are made directly accountable to local citizens.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) savings and real debt tracked each other in rough proportion, reflecting a system where household thrift and public borrowing were still bound by a common ceiling.

But the divergence started in the 1980s, as deficits compounded without a parallel rise in savings.

And the real break came after 2008: debt issuance outpaced the capacity of the household sector to accumulate real deposits, leaving monetary assets dwarfed by government liabilities.

The pandemic made this imbalance visible in extreme form, as savings briefly surged but were rapidly eroded by inflation while debt continued to march higher.

The result is a system structurally dependent on institutional balance sheets and foreign buyers to absorb public borrowing, with households no longer providing the ballast.

That shift matters for interest rate dynamics, for financial stability and for the sustainability of fiscal dominance: the private cushion has thinned, and with it the margin of safety in the domestic savings base.

***Photo above*** *- local Albuquerque residents break open a few cold ones to celebrate $800 million in tax breaks awarded to a proposed nuclear power plant.*  
  
People in Albuquerque are cheering. Pacific Fusion has selected New Mexico for its $1 billion nuclear fusion plant. New Mexicans aren’t going to see any actual electricity from this new plant, however. It will CONSUME power instead, because this is just an experiment, not a working reactor. See [ABQjournal.com](http://ABQjournal.com) link below.  
  
I had never heard of “Pacific Fusion” before this morning, so I googled them. Wikipedia has never heard of them either. The closest I came to authentic financial data was the link at bottom, to the Financial Post. A year ago Pacific Fusion's first mention was: “unknown startup nabs $900 million from venture capitalists”. They have zero plants until today's announcement. The Albuquerque location will be their first. And New Mexico taxpayers have become venture capital investors to the tune of $800 million.  
  
Although I am clearly ridiculing the use of tax dollars to propel venture capitalists’ schemes, please note that I am NOT dissing fusion power itself. Even though we've had dozens of claims of fusion breakthroughs over the last decade, and so far no device that produces more kilowatts than it consumes. The Albuquerque plant will do exactly the same.  
  
Remember the tickertape parades and popping champagne corks when some college professor announced he had invented “cold fusion”? That sounds significantly safer than the device proposed for Albuquerque, which will operate at 150 million degrees Celsius – hotter than the center of the sun. Has anybody checked out if that will add to global warming? And if a fusion reactor melts like a broken Fukushima or Chernobyl containment vessel, will it ""safely"" sink into the center of the earth, so it doesn’t harm anyone? What happens when a 150-million-degree fireball reaches the center of our planet, which is only 10,000 degrees? That core will be more than 1,000 times hotter than the lava at there. I hope this isn't one of the experiments Pacific Fusion has planned for its new plant.  
  
I am not inherently against fusion experiments, whether cold, or room temperature, or hotter than the sun. I am not against wind turbine farms, solar farms, tidal power, thermal generation from magma fissures, microwave beams pointed at us from orbiting satellites. I just don’t want my tax dollars given to billionaire venture capitalists to make money off these things.  
  
Let the venture capitalists and/or shareholders bear ALL the risk. Unless someone holds a vote and America's Amazon drivers, public school teachers, and soybean farmers sign up to have their tax dollars involved. Don't leave these decisions in the hands of the local mayor and city council. They're simply lawyers and former school board members who can't even keep the water supply running safely.  
  
But I personally won’t be on the hook for a dime this time. Residents of Albuquerque, this one’s totally on you. But consider breaking ground on a new fire department located near this research hotspot. Just in case 150 million degrees has unintended consequences no one anticipated. We’ve never actually been to the core of the sun you know, so whatever's happening there is strictly a matter of conjecture. And ask the people of Fukushima and Chernobyl what happened their mayors invited ""normal"" nuclear reactors to their towns.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

Will machines make humans useless. Despite the claims of leftists, humans aren't equal. Most humans will become dependents relying on the state to feed clothe and house them. However there will be a minority of humans, who create original art, and transform business and society. Will ordinary humans become powerless, will democracy survive?

Perhaps the only way to save humanity, is with machine augmentation and genetic engineering, where they are able to successfully compete with machines and live alongside them.

Pitted against the VCs, the AI models came out on top. For context, top firms broadly get it right one time in 20. But some LLMs did much better. OpenAI’s GPT-5 correctly picked a winner half the time. China’s DeepSeek-V3 beat the lot, able to single out a future success story six times out of 10. It was also able to do so more cheaply than most other models.

According to Fool49:

I don't think generative AI is quite ready to work independently and replace venture capitalists. But certainly give them a run for the money. What worked in the past, won't work in the future.  But I think it can create a shortlist of entrepreneurs to invest in, for review by VCs. And it might make us rethink venture capitalism. Maybe investors, instead of investing only through VCs, can also use generative AI to directly invest in startups and their founders.

At its core, it tells you whether the banking system is functioning as a credit engine or as a distribution channel for government debt.

The fact that the ratio has never regained its early-1970s high is the fact that regulation, capital charges and liquidity rules over the years have tilted balance sheets toward Treasuries, while loan demand is increasingly met outside banks through private credit markets.

The consequence is that fiscal issuance, not private lending, increasingly dominates how banks deploy their balance sheet. Of course, that reshapes the transmission of policy.

However, its proposal has already been met with opposition from a government minister hailing from a different part of the ruling coalition, who says that it is “not the right time yet” to introduce such an obligation.



While in many countries it is standard for restaurants to offer tap water if requested – or sometimes even to simply bring it to tables unrequested – in Poland the practice is rare. Indeed, many people remain suspicious of drinking tap water in general.

On Wednesday, deputy infrastructure minister Przemysław Koperski, who hails from The Left, announced that his group had submitted proposed additions to a planned amendment of Poland’s law on water supplies and sewage disposal, which is already intended to further improve drinking-water standards.

Among the newly proposed measures is the introduction of a requirement for restaurants to provide half a litre of tap water for free to every person who orders food.



Other elements include ensuring free access to drinking water in public places, improving the quality of tap water, introducing a rapid warning system if any contamination of water supplies is detected, and helping provide access to running water for those who do not currently have it.

Announcing the measures in parliament, Piotr Kowal, a Left MP, said that it is important to promote drinking tap water because it is more environmentally friendly than consuming water from plastic or glass bottles, reports the Polish Press Agency (PAP).

A number of cities in Poland have in recent years run campaigns encouraging residents to drink tap water, which they note is safe, as well as being cheaper and more environmentally friendly than bottled water.



The Left’s proposals were, however, rejected by infrastructure minister Dariusz Klimczak, who comes from the centre-right Polish People’s Party (PSL), another member of the ruling coalition.

“I don’t think it’s the right time yet, and I won’t support this type of solution,” Klimczak told Radio Zet. “Not all places in Poland have tap water. I wouldn’t want to impose on businesses that you have to give it away for free from now on.”

“We currently have bigger problems on our hands with water: flood control measures, drought control measures, decentralisation of \[state agency\] Polish Waters,” he added. “Once I’ve dealt with that, I’d be happy to discuss free water at restaurants.”



The entire draft amendment to the water law – including The Left’s proposed additions – has now passed to the parliamentary committee on local government and regional policy, which will continue work on the legislation, reports the *Dziennik Gazeta Prawna* daily.

Among other measures included in the bill – which is intended to bring Poland in line with the EU’s Drinking Water Directive – are more stringent quality parameters for drinking water and requirements for water companies to provide customers with clearer data on prices and consumption.

There will also be greater responsibilities for property owners to conduct periodic risk assessments of water supplies and easier online access to up-to-date water quality information for residents.",4,0,0,economy,reddit,https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/09/26/left-calls-for-law-guaranteeing-free-tap-water-in-restaurants-in-poland/,new,Unknown,0.75

This would mean that creating new currency causes the devaluation of all the currency in circulation. This is the argument for why new government debt causes inflation.

I encountered a few historical examples that makes me question this simplistic view on the causes of inflation.

1. Roosevelt and the New Deal 
During the Great Depression Roosevelt created government debt to finance infrastructure projects and thus creating jobs to revive the economy. This did not cause a spike in inflation or higher inflation in the years after.

2. Japan
Japan has a very high debt/gdp ratio and also spent a lot of money sourced from debt. It hasnt seen a spike in inflation. It rather is in a phase of deflation.

3. The GFC in the US
After the collapse of the banking sector and the financial crisis that followed, the government printed money to bail out banks and stimulate the economy. The US hasnt seen a high inflation period in the 2010s.

I am sure there are more examples of government spending not triggering inflation.

A different argument that speaks against the thesis of money printing being responsible for inflation is the data. If the thesis was true, then a spike in debt/gdp or deficit would come (or followed by) an increase of the inflation rate. There should be a high correlation or correlation with lag. I looked at several developed countries and could not see that (I haven't done a statistical analysis of time series yet but I might do this if I find the time). 


So there is a lot of data that does not speak for the theory that has been supported by most economists (for example Milton Friedman).

Let’s get caught up to speed, for the benefit of everyone still obsessing over Epstein and Charlie Kirk:  
  
**Trump** (to planet): “You’re all going to pay huge tariffs on everything. I will change the amounts daily. Bwaaaah!!!”  
  
**China** (to US): “Please cancel our US soybean purchases for 2025. We’ll let you know later about 2026”  
  
**Farmers** (to Trump): “We need a $47 billion bailout because now China is buying all its soybeans from Argentina”  
  
**Trump**: “I’m going to bail out Argentina’s economy. Make Argentina Great Again. And here’s a new tariff on kitchen cabinets, in case anyone was thinking of remodeling.”  
  
The silver lining: at least no talking heads will appear on CNN and PBS wringing their hands over soybean inflation in America’s supermarkets. Stop laughing - all of this is true. See link at bottom.  
  
If you had asked me to guess the value of the annual US soybean crop, I’d have said anywhere from $1 billion to $1 trillion. If you asked me how much of America’s farmland is devoted to soybeans, I’d have been equally helpless. Turns out it’s 85 million acres, equal to the combined land mass of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and Delaware. See second link at bottom.  
  
That is a LOT of farmland devoted just to grow soybeans. What does China do with all of these beans? If you said “tofu” (curdled soy milk, congealed to impersonate cheese) you’d be wrong. China mostly feeds our soybeans to their pigs. Which in turn become pork egg rolls, sweet and sour spareribs, and possibly bacon.  
  
I’m okay with this, if it keeps China from harvesting wild bats and selling them alive in “wet markets”, which THEN ends up infecting half the world with the Covid 19 virus. If that’s the way it actually happened, and the pandemic WASN’T a leak from their Wuhan military experimental virus lab . . .  
  
**Let’s cut to the chase.** I wish no misfortune on America’s farmers. But those 85 million acres are probably put to better use feeding America, rather than fattening pigs to feed a global adversary which is constantly hacking America’s airports and banks, threatening to invade Taiwan, and torturing it’s Nobel peace prize winners in prison.  
  
Can we have a conversation about putting America first (not China or Argentina) and keeping our own people fed and housed?  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

Since the link between illegal money flows and the shadow banking system is still a relatively underexplored field (with limited academic coverage), I’m looking for serious sources to deepen my research. Beyond the well-known cases of Wachovia and HSBC, are there any major investigative reports, long-form journalism pieces, or reliable communities/forums where I can gather insights?

The goal is to build a solid foundation without sounding speculative in front of my professors — so I’m especially interested in credible investigative journalism, financial watchdog reports, or discussions in expert forums rather than conspiracy theories.",3,3,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nrral0/drug_money_and_2008_crisis_thesis/,new,Unknown,1.0

🌽 Maize area ↑ 17% (9.8M hectares, 5-year high)

🌶️ Red chilli exports ↓ 32% this year

Ethanol blending hit 19.8%, with corn now supplying 52% of ethanol


Corn offers higher profits (₹28k/acre vs ₹8k for chillies), shorter crop cycles, and 30–40% less water use. Meanwhile, chilli farmers are hit by collapsing prices, water scarcity, and falling exports.

This shift isn’t just about crops — it’s about policy-driven change reshaping India’s agriculture.

1nrmx72,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 01:17:59,AI leading to jobless growth,"According to imf.org:

The question is whether all this start-up activity is contributing significantly to job growth. Recent research published by the Federal Reserve suggests that the recent wave of start-ups is less likely than previous upsurges to contribute to employment growth. Young, high-growth start-ups accounted for less than 6 percent of employment in 2024, compared with almost 10 percent in 1985, according to the Fed. AI tech–driven start-ups tend to be capital- and skill-intensive, requiring fewer workers.

Productivity and wage increases manifest in the highest-skilled workers; automation reduces the wages of those engaged in routine tasks. Economic dynamism—whereby new businesses boost economic growth—may well reflect not so much large start-ups employing large numbers of workers as an increase in the number of start-ups, each one spawning more such firms thanks to a boost in the region’s risk-taking culture.

According to fool49:

AI will benefit high skilled workers, who can develop, manage, or use AI solutions. As for the deplorables, their numbers and wages will probably remain stagnant. Everyone should have the opportunity to reach their full potential. For the smart or hard working few, it may mean high paying and meaningful work. For the ignorant or lazy majority, it may mean low paying and meaningless work.

Which side are you on?

We graduate knowing mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell — but not how compounding interest makes or breaks your savings. That’s backwards.

History →
Because cycles repeat. Inflation today looks a lot like the 1970s. Debt blowups? Seen them before. If you know the playbook, you’re less likely to be blindsided.

Finance →
Because your wallet is the frontline. Credit cards, loans, compounding, budgeting — this is the difference between building wealth or sinking into debt.

Econ 101 →
Because GDP (Gross Domestic Product), inflation, and trade aren’t abstract. They decide your rent, your wages, your taxes, and whether your job survives the next cycle.

And yes, crypto belongs here too →

Not as a lottery ticket, but as part of the financial landscape you’ll need to understand. If you’re just starting out, a simple plan is DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) into the required holdings: BTC (Bitcoin) and ETH (Ethereum). Beyond that, satellite positions in SOL (Solana), LINK (Chainlink), and newer smart contract plays like Ether.fi are higher-risk, higher-potential bets.

The bigger picture →

You need a diversified financial planner mindset. Not a mutual fund salesman, not a pure-crypto influencer, not a day-trader, and not just another newsletter. The advisor you want in today’s world is one who actually sees the macroeconomic picture — interest rates, energy shocks, currency shifts, inflation cycles — and helps you adjust across stocks, bonds, commodities, crypto, and cash. Too many people blow up their portfolios chasing one lane. The real edge is having guidance that integrates it all, so you’re protected when the cycle turns.

Takeaway

“If you don’t understand the system, you’re stuck playing by someone else’s rules. Econ, Finance, and yes — knowing the basics of crypto — aren’t electives anymore. They’re survival skills.” - The Founder 

Pardon if I’m wasting time for my more experienced readers, but a refresher doesn’t hurt!

China’s international operations centre for the digital yuan opened in Shanghai on Thursday, with the People’s Bank of China highlighting three platforms designed to accelerate the internationalisation of the digital Chinese currency. “The evolution of monetary and payment systems in the digital era is a historical inevitability,” central bank deputy governor Lu Lei told a news conference on Wednesday. “The PBOC is committed to providing open, inclusive and innovative solutions to improve the global cross-border payment system.”

One of the three platforms is a cross-border digital payment platform that will explore the use of the central bank-backed digital currency – also known as e-CNY – to improve the efficiency of international transactions. Another is a blockchain service platform that will enable on-chain payments and provide standardised cross-chain transaction information transfers, and the third is a digital asset platform that will help existing financial infrastructure expand onto the blockchain by providing standardised, ready-to-use digital asset services.

But amid growing tensions with the United States over trade and technology issues, China has stepped up its push to expand overseas adoption of the yuan and e-CNY and accelerate the rise of Shanghai as a global financial hub to reduce its reliance on a US dollar-dominated financial system. In July, US President Donald Trump signed a law that would allow regulated US banks to issue stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to another asset – backed by the US dollar, a move that many observers say could pave the way for mass-market adoption and extend the currency's dominance into the digital realm.

While Beijing is wary of cryptocurrencies and their related risks, it has embraced the use of blockchain technology for its traceability and transparency, and applied it in the adoption of e-CNY. The PBOC has begun to collaborate with central banks in Hong Kong, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on a cross-border platform for digital currency payments. In a notice issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China on September 13, Beijing encouraged more financial institutions to explore the use of the digital yuan for cross-border payments.",0,0,0,economy,reddit,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3326928/will-chinas-digital-yuan-centre-be-step-forward-internationalisation,new,Unknown,0.44

***Photo above*** *- recent conclave of RUSSIAN generals. They apparently have more medals than their Pentagon counterparts, but worse dental coverage. Stay away from those hotel windows, guys . . .*

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned 800 generals admirals to Virginia for an impromptu meeting. I don’t know if 800 is “all of them”, but it’s a lot. I’ve been asking the government to consider closing or merging some of America’s 800 military bases worldwide. Now it appears that we have more than 1 general per base.

I was certain this was the most generals ever, but Google says there were 1,500 during World War 2. Google can’t tell for sure, however, because of promotions, demotions, retirements, and MIA. But that was wartime. Are we officially at war with anyone right now? Other than Washington DC and Los Angeles, mean. Is there a national guard general in DC overseeing the troops collecting trash there?

Each general travelling to Virginia will be accompanied by at least 1 senior advisor and several more aides. The total number of guests could exceed 3,000 . . . easily.

Defense Secretary Hegseth is no stranger to military service himself. He was (for approximately 11 months) a national guard reservist tasked with overseeing the care and feeding of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. So this has GOTTA be the thrill of a lifetime for him to summon and browbeat all the guys who were ever above him in the chain of command. If he has time, Hegseth should also take the wheel of an Abrams tank or Humvee, just for the fun of it.

Rumors are rampant that Hegseth plans to fire (or offer early retirement) to at least 100 generals. But we would still have at least 700 on standby, so I don’t think this materially weakens America’s security. In fact, knowing how the military works, I bet that about 30 seconds after those generals start packing their footlockers, a bunch of colonels start getting promoted to general, and majors get bumped up to colonel, etc. If you don’t think this will happen, you are invited to explain your reasoning.

Another line of speculation is that Hegseth is going to order the generals, admirals, commodores, and whatever to root out all the troops in their command who made disparaging social media posts about Charlie Kirk. Or give everyone a giant pay raise. Or prepare for World War 3. You can’t rule ANYTHING out.

The average General and Admiral earns about $220,000 a year. So if 100 of them do take early retirement, the savings will only be $22 million a year. Chump change. Except that they will all get military retirement pensions (as they should), so the actual savings will be quite a bit smaller.

But the optics of this are going to be great. *“Hey folks, I just fired 100 generals. But don’t worry, we still have at least 3 secret bases in Mogadishu Somalia nobody even knows about, so we’re safer than ever. Ignore the state sponsored hacking which is disabling our airports and commercial flights”.*

  
I'm just sayin' . . .

1nqyhs3,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 07:09:51,Starbucks is closing hundreds of stores and laying off 900 workers what’s going on?,"Starbucks just announced a massive restructuring plan that’s going to shake up how (and where) you get your lattes.

☕ The short version

Hundreds of stores are closing in the U.S. and Canada (and some in Europe).

About 900 corporate/support staff are being laid off.

Starbucks is taking a $1 billion hit in restructuring costs mostly from severance, lease exits, and shutting down underperforming stores.

Same-store sales in the U.S. have fallen for six straight quarters.

Why is Starbucks doing this?

Money talks: A lot of stores just aren’t pulling in enough to cover high rent, labor, and operating costs.

Changing habits: Customers are feeling inflation and cutting back on $6 coffees. Home-brewing setups and local cafés are eating into Starbucks’ dominance.

Strategy shift: CEO Brian Niccol says the company wants to get back to basics. That means fewer but better stores  over 1,000 are getting facelifts ( uplifts ) in the next year.

Reshuffling resources: Closing weaker locations frees up cash to invest in stronger ones.

But here’s the messy part

Workers are caught in the middle. Starbucks says baristas at closing stores can transfer, but critics argue many will end up jobless.

Unions are watching closely. Starbucks has been fighting unionization efforts, and some are accusing the company of using closures to target organized stores (something Starbucks denies).

Reputation risk: Starbucks built its brand on being everywhere. Cutting hundreds of stores risks making it less convenient which could push people to competitors.

Big picture

This isn’t just about coffee. It’s about how big chains handle inflation, high overhead, and changing consumer habits. Starbucks is betting that fewer stores + remodeled locations = higher profits. But with $1B in restructuring costs and rising competition, it’s a risky gamble.

If the turnaround works, Starbucks could reinvent itself. If not, your neighborhood green siren might not be around much longer.

1nqws6z,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 05:26:57,i got a question about energy backed currency,"first i see that a lot of people take energy as a ""stock"" from my research but its not energy comes and goes what you should mesure is how much a country is producing per hour hense the name of energy WH so like 0.01$=1kwh produced.

so from what i see it would link your currency to how much actual product your country is producing instead of speculations and such if you have 100 factories,1000homes and 300buisnesses in a country you can predict the value of a currency since it mirrors the economic stability of a country and

an energy backed currency would actualy make corruption harder since 1kwh=1kwh even in the 4th dimension or inside a black hole its physics you cant just lie and tell someone i got 16 terrawatt/h produced if you lie then the engineers wont have data to regulate the energy production to consumption and the grid will burn

and for the people saying if the grid fails i mean if the grid fails in the modern age you got much much much bigger problems to think about a money wont worth anything if nobody can go work

and it would force the goverment to diversify their energy production to make the currency more stable wich in turn is good for the enviroment

and for inequality between countries i mean we already have that tbh but rn if a currency is already stronger and more stable than other currencies he is the king of the hill and no one can take it from him but if it was an energy backed system small countries will have a chance to compete and have a much more stable currency than other countries

and the value of goods and services will increase with the amount of currency since you need energy to produce any other value

so yeah ik that there are some other problems but we have those same problems here and ik that there has to be smth that makes it not even thought about other than resistence from the elites since this removes TON of power from the elite and gives it to the nature of economics ps(i am by no mean an economist i am just an engineering student lol)",0,0,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nqws6z/i_got_a_question_about_energy_backed_currency/,new,Unknown,0.5

1nqvv72,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 04:26:41,Like it's year 1670 again,"# When We Say ""Economy,"" Do We Mean ""Gentry""?

# How Neutral Language Masks Concentrated Power

When politicians promise to ""help the economy"" or economists discuss ""market forces,"" the language sounds universal and democratic. But beneath these neutral terms lies a more uncomfortable reality: what we call ""the economy"" is largely controlled by a small class of owners who bear striking resemblance to the historical gentry.

# The Numbers

The concentration of economic power in modern America is staggering. As of 2023, the top 1% of American households owned 30 cents of every dollar, while in the first quarter of 2024, almost two-thirds percent of the total wealth in the United States was owned by the top 10 percent of earners. Meanwhile, the lowest 50 percent of earners only owned 2.5 percent of the total wealth.

But when we look specifically at productive capital ownership of businesses, stocks, and income-generating real estate, the concentration becomes even more extreme. The richest 1 percent own 50 percent of U.S. stock and mutual funds, up from 40 percent in 2002, according to Federal Reserve data. In fact, a record 93% of stock wealth is owned by the richest 10%, the Federal Reserve has found.

This isn't just about having money. It's about owning the systems that generate wealth: the factories, the algorithms, the distribution networks, the platforms where others work. A relatively small number of people own the means by which everyone else makes a living.

# The New Gentry Class

This ownership class functions remarkably like the historical gentry. Both derive their power and income primarily from ownership rather than labor. Both often inherit their advantages across generations. Both wield disproportionate political influence that flows directly from their economic position.

The key difference is that today's gentry own shares and intellectual property as well as landed estates. But the fundamental dynamic remains: a small class lives off the returns from assets while the majority work for wages within systems they don't control.

# The Language 

Here's where the euphemism becomes clear. When we hear ""economic growth,"" ""job creators,"" or ""market efficiency,"" these phrases obscure who actually makes the decisions and who benefits most from the outcomes.

""The economy"" sounds like a natural force or a collective endeavor. But in practice, major economic decisions such as where to invest, what to produce, how to organize work, and which communities get resources are made by and for the ownership class.

Consider how different our political discourse would sound if we used more precise language:

* ""Helping the economy"" becomes ""increasing returns to capital owners""
* ""Market forces"" becomes ""decisions by large asset holders""
* ""Economic policy"" becomes ""rules that govern how the ownership class can extract value""

# Beyond the Euphemism

Recognizing this linguistic sleight of hand doesn't require embracing any particular political solution. But it does demand intellectual honesty about how power actually works in our economic system.

When we strip away the neutral terminology, we see that many ""economic"" debates are really debates about class power: Should ownership be more distributed? Should workers have more say in workplace decisions? Should inheritance laws allow wealth concentration across generations?

These are fundamentally political questions about how we want to organize society, not technical questions about optimal resource allocation. The gentry, by whatever name we call them, understand this. Perhaps it's time the rest of us did too.

# The Power of Precise Language

Language shapes how we think about problems and solutions. As long as we discuss ""the economy"" as if it were a weather system rather than a set of human institutions controlled by specific people with specific interests, we'll struggle to have honest conversations about economic power.

The next time someone promises to ""help the economy,"" it's worth asking: whose economy? And who really controls it?

Also USA should not be allowed to engage in economic warfare against its enemies. Iran and Venezuela are sovereign nations. If they are guilty of human rights abuses, so are USA and India.

1nqied0,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 16:56:19,U.S. Economy Expands Fastest in the G7 — But Not Everyone Feels It,"Per the latest BEA revision reported by The Times (Mehreen Khan, 25 Sep 2025), the U.S. economy grew at an annualized 3.8% in Q2 — the fastest pace in nearly two years and the best among the G7. Consumer spending and private investment were revised higher, and initial jobless claims surprised to the downside. Whatever your politics, that’s real, measurable momentum.

But anyone who works with small producers, family businesses, or outside the big metros also knows: headline growth isn’t evenly experienced. Averages can conceal the fact that some groups are still under pressure (rising input costs, tighter financing, competition with scale players, and household balance-sheet strain).

The lesson from past “cuts-without-growth” experiments (Kansas is the usual case study) isn’t that reform is impossible. It’s that growth engines and governance have to move together. Cutting or subsidizing in a vacuum just shifts the pain around. The way you broaden participation is by pairing macro strength with practical pathways for people to adapt.

What that looks like in the real world:
	•	Business-model change for small players. Instead of endless, blunt subsidies, help farms and small firms modernize: technical assistance, market access, logistics co-ops, and low-interest public loans that crowd in private capital. That’s how you turn resilience into competitiveness.
	•	Smarter trade conditions. Whether via negotiated reciprocity or targeted tariffs, reduce arbitrage that punishes domestic producers while keeping export lanes open. The goal is better terms, not autarky.
	•	Balance-sheet prudence. In a volatile global system, owning hard, liquid hedges (households, institutions, and many central banks outside the U.S. have been net buyers of gold in recent years) can stabilize portfolios. For clarity: the U.S. official gold stock is largely unchanged; the point is risk management at the private/institutional level.
	•	Grow out of deficits. Sustained growth is the most durable way to lower debt-to-GDP. Austerity alone shrinks the tax base; growth plus reform expands it.

The U.S. posting 3.8% while leading the G7 is the good news. The next step is making sure more people can actually plug into that momentum. That’s less about abstract ideology and more about execution: practical finance, market access, and incentives that reward adaptation.

I’ll add a comment with a simple line chart showing the divergence (headline GDP improving vs. stress indicators for small business, farm income, and household debt) — not to dunk on the data, but to keep the discussion honest about who still needs a bridge into the boom.

***Photo above*** *- Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter. Notice the axe - it is NOT one of the 5 proven ways to kill a vampire for sure.*  
  
I have nothing against AI. It’s doing middle school kids' homework in a flash, giving them more time to play Call of Duty: Black Ops. In fact, AI is now designing videogames. The circle is unbroken!  
  
If you don’t play videogames, no need tot fret. AI is also doing the CGI on new TV series like “Star Trek – Strange New Worlds”. And possibly writing the screenplays as well. Which explains why ST-SNW episodes are rehashes of previous Star Trek series. AI just regurgitates what was trained on.  
  
The link below warns that AI is already using as much electricity as New York City and San Diego combined. I don’t really care about New York but I’d like to save San Diego if there’s still time. Maybe there isn’t. The article (Fortune magazine) goes on to theorize that AI will soon account for 10% of all the electricity used in the USA.  
  
If 10% doesn't seem like a lot, imagine the frenzy if someone warned that almond groves in California were using 10% of the state's water supply, or that 10% of the Brazilian rainforest was being clear-cut each year to create cattle pasture. (Both of these are true, apparently).  
  
In a related article (no link today, Google it) tech-boys are celebrating the imminent arrival of “backyard nuclear plants”. Not literally in YOUR back yard, if you own a 2,200 colonial on a quarter acre lot. Probably located in that vacanat lot which was going to become a mini-park with pickleball courts. (Village mayor: *“This should be a no-brainer. Do you want the lights to stay on, or do you want boomers playing pickleball day and night?”*)  
  
Just one problem: the typical US town doesn’t have the expertise to operate a nuclear power plant, even one the size of a shipping container. So they will hire some contractor to run it, like we do with private/for-profit prisons. And when it comes to plant maintenance and the safe storage of nuclear waste, those will be put on hold because the municipal employees’ pension fund is underfunded by a million dollars, and that has to be fixed before the next election, or those workers won’t vote to re-elect incumbent mayor and city council. (*""They saved our pensions!*)  
  
If you think the “deferred nuclear maintenance” thing won’t happen, just look at your own city’s water supply or mass transit. If you live in California, look overhead at the 100-year-old high voltage lines which keep sparking wildfires.  
  
As I noted at the start of today's column , I don’t hate AI. But kids won’t be any worse off if they have to cut and paste a Wikipedia article for their homework, instead of having ChatGPT tell them that Lincoln owned a fence installation business before he became president, freed the slaves, and hunted vampires.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

Barclays analysed 250 operational mines linked to 30 mining clients and around 9,000 power generation facilities from 40 European clients, and found both sectors faced notable earnings declines over five years.
The mining sector was hit harder, with earnings falling by around a quarter, driven largely by transition risks. Power companies saw a smaller impact of about 10%, mainly due to physical risks such as droughts and floods, which are more severe in degraded landscapes.

According to fool49:

Environmental degradation is going to have an impact on the bottom line. Europe must give up its addiction to raw materials and consumption. Transition to a sustainable or circular economy. Slow down or stop destruction of ecosystems and related services and biodiversity. EU talks a big game about protecting the environment. But what is the ground reality?

EU companies need to look after the triple bottom line: people, profit, and planet. EU policy needs to transition to maximizing GDP plus natural capital plus human capital. And tax those companies contributing to destruction of natural or human capital. While also rewarding companies with positive externalities.

Quantitative tightening mostly emptied ON RRP during the 2022-2024 period, as money funds migrated into bills, cushioning risk markets from reserve scarcity. But that cushion is gone! ON RRP usage has dwindled to near zero by late August 2025, so further balance‑sheet runoff now bites directly into bank reserves, the same regime that ended painfully in 2019.

The Fed already slowed QT twice — first in June 2024 and again in April 2025 — precisely to approach the unknown ample‑reserves regime more carefully. With TGA elevated and tax/quarter‑end ahead, marginal dollars will toggle between Treasury’s account and reserves with little buffer.

The implication is a market that becomes very sensitive to the cadence of bill issuance, tax dates and SRF take‑up: when TGA swells or issuance clusters, net liquidity sags and reserve balances tighten; when TGA drains, the relief rallies are sharp.

1npvhry,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 22:43:05,The Lesson of the Efficient Market Hypothesis: “Stock Prices Are Unpredictable”,"The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), first formalized by Eugene Fama in 1970, carries a sobering message for investors: if all publicly available information is already reflected in stock prices, then predicting tomorrow’s price is essentially impossible.

Why “Good News” Doesn’t Guarantee Gains

Markets tend to price in expectations before the news hits the wire. If investors anticipate that a company will post blockbuster earnings tomorrow, the stock price usually rises today—well before the actual announcement. Once the earnings are released, the price adjusts only to whatever new information emerges. That’s why trying to guess where a stock will go next is a fool’s errand. This logic underpins the random walk hypothesis, which argues that stock prices move unpredictably.

Does That Make Stock Analysis Useless?

Not necessarily. EMH suggests that on average, it’s extremely difficult to beat the market, which is why index funds have become the go-to investment vehicle for many. But markets are not perfectly efficient. Behavioral economists, like Nobel laureate Robert Shiller, have shown that fear, greed, and herd behavior create bubbles and crashes that EMH alone cannot explain.

The Buffett Exception

The existence of investors like Warren Buffett raises an uncomfortable question: if markets are truly efficient, how can anyone consistently outperform? Dismissing decades of outperformance as “luck” feels unsatisfying. Buffett himself has admitted, however, that most investors should simply buy low-cost index funds rather than chasing alpha. His success reflects both extraordinary discipline and the fact that markets, while mostly efficient, have pockets of inefficiency.

Where EMH Still Guides Us

Even if the hypothesis is not absolute, its implications matter:

1. Beware of hot tips. If a piece of information is truly valuable, chances are it’s already in the price.

2. Don’t overestimate your edge. For every investor who beats the market, someone else must lag behind—sometimes badly.

3. Stay humble. The stock market thrives on uncertainty, and those who forget that risk becoming the “greater fool.”

In the end, EMH doesn’t mean markets are perfectly rational, but it does remind us that chasing short-term predictions is a losing game. For most people, the smarter path is clear: own the market, stay invested, and avoid the temptation of easy promises.",3,0,0,economy,reddit,https://i.redd.it/r0rcb7gs48rf1.jpeg,new,Unknown,1.0

1npg998,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 12:07:37,Will money collapse forever?,"It comes to a meaning of what is money. Money is a resource of exchange for goods and services. For thousands of years, from the days of Mesopotamia when clay tablets recorded debts of grain and silver, money has acted as both a symbol of trust and a mechanism of coordination. People accepted it not because the coins or notes themselves had value, but because everyone agreed they could be used to obtain something else of value or can be easily tangible.

Fast forward to today, money is mostly digital signals blinking across banking servers, algorithmically traded faster than any human can blink. Yet even in this form, the same principle holds: money is is just data. And today's value has been depended on human scarcity. On the idea that our labor, our time, our knowledge, are limited and must be exchanged.

Here is where the story bends: artificial intelligence is beginning to unravel this foundation. If AI agents can design, produce, negotiate, and distribute with **near-zero** marginal cost, then the scarcity of human effort once the very anchor of money’s meaning is dissolved. Why would anyone pay for something when an AI can produce it endlessly and flawlessly? What would happen if these are powered fully by **renewable energy**? If machines outperform humans in nearly every market, the logic of exchange itself falters.

This does not necessarily mean collapse in the apocalyptic sense, but a metamorphosis. The end of money as we know it may give rise to a new system of ownership: perhaps measured not in dollars or crypto-tokens, but in access, reputation, or even attention. In such a future, the “resource of exchange” might no longer be material at all, but social, cognitive, or experiential.

The paradox is that money has always been both fiction and reality. A fiction because it only works if we believe in it, a reality because that belief has shaped empires, economies, and daily life. The arrival of AI may push us toward a future where we need to invent a new fiction, and probably form a new civilization into another planet. One fit for a world where human labor is not the bottleneck.

The real question isn’t whether money collapses forever, but what replaces it when humans are no longer the engines of value creation? Let's discuss this",0,4,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1npg998/will_money_collapse_forever/,new,Unknown,0.17

1jq1qji,2025-04-02,2025-04-02 18:24:11,"Trump's ""Tariff"" Numbers Are Just Trade Balance Ratios","These ""tariff"" numbers provided by the administration are just ludicrous. They don't reflect any version of reality where real tariffs are concerned. I was convinced they weren't just completely made up, though, and their talk about trade balances made me curious enough to dig in and try to find where they got these numbers.

This guess paid off immediately. As far as I can tell with just a tiny bit of digging, almost all of these numbers are literally just the inverse of our trade balance as a ratio. Every value I have tried this calculation on, it has held true.


I'll just use the 3 highest as examples:

***Cambodia: 97%***

US exports to Cambodia: $321.6 M

Cambodia exports to US: 12.7 B

Ratio: 321.6M / 12.7 B = ~3%

https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/southeast-asia-pacific/Cambodia-

***Vietnam: 90%***

US exports to Vietnam: $13.1 B

Vietnam exports to US: $136.6 B

Ratio: 13.1B / 136.6B = ~10%

https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/southeast-asia-pacific/vietnam

***Sri Lanka: 88%***

US exports to Sri Lanka: $368.2 M

Sri Lanka exports to US: $3.0 B

Ratio: ~12%

https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/south-central-asia/sri-lanka

What the Administration appears to be calling a ""97% tariff"" by Cambodia is in reality the fact that we export 97% less stuff to Cambodia than they export to us.

EDIT: The minimum 10% seems to have been applied when the trade balance ratio calculation resulted in a number lower than that, even if we actually have a trade *surplus* with that country.",11994,913,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1jq1qji/trumps_tariff_numbers_are_just_trade_balance/,year,Unknown,0.97

1) China inks a deal with Brazil to buy their soybeans. China dropped its US soybean orders to just 1,800 tons’ worth in the week ending April 17 – down massively from 72,800 tons purchased the week before, (Source: USDA)

2) China inks a deal with Spain (and other EU countries) to buy their Pork.  China then cancels a shipment of 12,000 tons of pork from the USA

3) trucking companies lay off drivers who transport goods from the farms to the ports. Independent truckers can't get jobs.

4) Longshoremen are now out of work from cancelled sailings and from the fact that China cancelled all terminal deliveries of Chinese vessels because Trump slapped them with a port fee. 

5) The majority of Christmas toys come from China. There will be bare shelves for Christmas as the shipments are due to sail in 2 months time.  Toy companies, warehouses, and trucking are hit with layoffs as the warehouses will be bare.

6) Germany announced that they move their gold reserve from USA to Switzerland. 30 countries house their gold in the USA but now this is in question as the US economy is in question for stability. 

7) The US dollar is falling. And that’s a bit odd. Because this is happening at a time when US bond yields are rising. Normally you’d see both these things lifting the dollar. Also, when the world gets risky, global investors usually rush to the US. They buy US government bonds, convert their currencies into dollars. The dollar gets stronger. That’s how it’s  always worked. But that’s not what we’re seeing this time. Investors are swapping the dollar assets they hold for anything else — gold and even Japanese and European bonds. Basically, the dollar is losing its safe-haven status.

There will be no quick fix for this as the slide of the US Economy continues to build momentum and mass layoffs begin.

UPDATE: Many of you are just looking at only China but Trump slapped tariffs on the entire world (except Russia, Belarus, and North Korea). China is the example to a greater exodus from the US market.

UPDATE #2 -U.S. employers posted 7.2 million vacancies in March, down from 7.5 million in February and 8.1 million in March 2024. It was the fewest number of openings since September and below the 7.5 million that economists had forecast. (SOURCE: WashingtonPost).

UPDATE #3 - The US Economy shrunk 0.03%   (SOURCE: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/gdp-q1-2025-.html ).

1jqt346,2025-04-03,2025-04-03 16:20:18,The Blindingly Obvious Goal of Trump’s Tariffs That Everyone Seems to be Missing…,"I keep seeing confusion about what Trump’s trying to accomplish with his new “tariffs on the world (except Russia, of course)” strategy.



Some have come up with partial truths, like him crashing the economy so that his billionaire friends can sell in advance, short the market then buy the dip, and further consolidating industries by knocking out small and medium sized businesses (eg. https://www.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/s/pjgB8tIqpW) and while those may be side benefits, it misses his BY FAR most important motive:



**His goal with these tariffs is to force any corporations that want to survive to submit to his direct control & “buy” his favor (a, by definition, fascist takeover FWIW).**



This is classic mob boss “carrot & stick persuasion” tactics & they are **terrifyingly** effective.



**By imposing mixed levels of industry and country-specific tariffs & making it clear that these are all being imposed (& removed)** ***at his will*****, Trump is able to dramatically (& immediately) influence nearly every company’s relative costs & competitiveness.**

**Within an astonishingly short period (likely just a matter of weeks or months) this financial control will force even the largest companies to submit to his demands in order to get the specific tariffs driving up the cost of \*their\* products & supply chains reduced or removed. Those who don't play by his rules will end up having to charge more & profit less, & will eventually be driven out of business by the competition that does play along.**



With this latest move, he’s given the CEOs & board rooms of America a **very clear, stark choice**:



Do whatever he says (likely including in the long term purging your company of anyone who publicly opposes him & no longer advertising on platforms that allow opposition messaging), publicly praise him and “donate” millions to his “campaign"" (for a 3rd term?), and the tariffs that most directly affect your bottom line will be magically reduced or removed overnight.



Do anything he doesn’t like, in contrast, and he’ll reimpose or increase them instead.



His calculus is simple:



He’s got another 3 1/2 years of executive power, minimum (you’re dreaming if you think BOTH the Republican-controlled house & 2/3rds of the Senate would ever vote to remove him, and even if they did, Vance would likely just continue with these tactics).



Most CEOs can only survive a year ***at most*** of continually losing market share to the competitors that *are* willing to pay to play before they’ll be replaced by someone more compliant.



This means that by the 2026 midterms, any remaining corporate opposition will be substantially weakened and on its way out the door. By 2028, they will be utterly marginalized or gone.



For anyone who thinks this is alarmist, you only have to look at the brazen effectiveness of his most recent targeted attacks via executive order on the nation’s largest law firms.



Law firms that had previously participated in cases against him (or his cronies) have been individually named and prohibited from entering federal buildings (obviously a necessity to participate in federal court cases), had their security clearances threatened and been banned from working with federal agencies (often a multimillion dollar portion of their business).



The result?



One by one, **and within just a few weeks**, they’ve ALL bent the knee and not only dropped the cases they *were* working on, but also “donated” tens of millions in free legal work for organizations that Trump likes in order to get his executive orders reversed (successfully, btw). Understanding the clear intended message of these targeted attacks, many of the other big law firms have already announced plans to preemptively bribe (er, provide) him with over $100 million in pro bono services(!):



[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-big-law-firms-retribution/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-big-law-firms-retribution/)



FWIW, this has been Trump’s MO forever, so no one should be surprised. He has always used his outsized wealth and power to bully others into doing his bidding. Whether it’s stiffing small contractors out of millions after they’ve done all the work, then burying them in legal debt when they try to complain until they've commit suicide ([https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454](https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454)) or publicly humiliating fellow Republicans into complete submission (eg. Lil Marco Rubio, Lyin' Ted Cruz, etc), this is simply how he operates.



This is all out of the Dictator’s handbook, of course, and it’s why our founding fathers designated the power of the purse to congress instead of the president alone. Unfortunately, congresspeople are far too cowardly to assert their rightful power and will passively watch our democracy die long before they do anything about it. It seems highly unlikely that any company can resist this type of targeted coercion long term.



How we the people respond will determine whether the country we grew up in still exists in recognizable form just a few months from now.

TL,DR: The “emergency” powers Trump currently has allow him to start, stop and dramatically alter international tariffs at will.

Given his extensive record of abusing power for personal gain (as demonstrated recently by him sabotaging individual law firms’ ability to conduct business with individually targeted executive orders, forcing them to not only stop all work on cases against him and his cronies, but also give him hundreds of millions of dollars in free labor in order for him to rescind them. These orders caused other law firms to preemptively offer him hundred million dollar bribes as well).

I’m suggesting that he is likely to abuse his power again, effectively controlling many companies’ ability to compete depending on their compliance with his demands. By suddenly raising and lowering tariffs by large amounts (currently 50% in some cases, and there’s no reason he can’t go higher to make a point), he can attack individual companies’ respective weak points and sabotage their operations, making them consistently less competitive. He can also pair this with reduced tariffs on their rivals, making them MORE competitive. He can thus pit them against one another, consistently punishing the least complaint and rewarding the most compliant to strengthen their hand.

Because most companies legally exist to maximize shareholder profits, this will eventually force them to either acquiesce to his demands (no matter how extreme, eg. Demanding they replace employees he dislikes with people he does and participate in crimes) or be forced out of business, leading to what’s commonly known as a fascist state.

This isn’t random. He’s doing it for one (or both) of the following reasons:

1. Crash the economy → Lower stock prices, raise uncertainty → Force the Fed to slash interest rates and bond yields *(He’s said it himself — no one can make money with high rates)*
2. Insider trading & sketchy deals → His friends, donors, and cronies benefit from market volatility → Classic pump-and-dump or position-then-policy play

**Let’s be clear — he’s not doing this for America.**  
Not for the ""Golden Age""  
Not to ""bring back manufacturing jobs""  
**He doesn’t believe in any of that.**

Neither do his advisors.

Could this be the first tangible step in Americas decline -- the death and destruction of an entire industry?

Before Trump, America was a place to be emulated, admired, and a dream country to visit .Now we are a country to be pitied, even with our economic might we are viewed as a country of bumkins who elected a narcissistic buffoon - a tin plate tyrant and bully - and that reputation is growing to include us all.

No longer Bush's 'Shining city on a hill', we are now being recognized as a country with a government rotting from the inside, comprised of bureaucrats pandering and quaking,  where freedoms so costly fought for are being challenged daily, where dissenting , lawful citizens are threatened with deportation if they don't toe the fascistic line, and an authoritarian regime catering to our worst angels; dullards who equate sophistication and education with weakness.

You remember that gang in high school, the bullies, street thugs and tramps you were warned to stay away from?

This is the welcome mat we have extended to the world, and the world is turning up their noses at the stench!

See this:



The United States is experiencing a clear and measurable decline in its dominance of the travel industry. This is a financial gut-punch, not hyperbole or economic scare tactics. The collapse of America's inbound tourism industry is expected to cost up to $29 billion in 2025 alone, with repercussions for local economies, transportation, and hospitality. While other countries are setting new records, the United States, one of 184 economies, is seeing a complete drop in foreign visitor spending. This isn't a statistical anomaly. Policy, perception, and the psychology of foreign tourists who are collectively opting to spend their money elsewhere are all contributing factors to this dramatic reversal.

Geopolitical tensions, shifting global alliances, and competitive destinations that have taken advantage of America's current difficulties are some of the underlying factors that go beyond simple economic conditions. The effect spreads further into the service sectors that depend significantly on foreign visitors, escalating regional inequalities and compounding losses in sources of income that have historically been thought of as steady.

1mri8fs,2025-08-15,2025-08-15 22:32:29,"There are many people on Reddit who envy China's clean and tidy cities. As a Mongolian who was born in China and has lived there for thirty years, I hope to clarify a few things.","The Chinese government isn't magical. A big reason China has clean and tidy cities is that it's a centralized and internally colonial government. Here are some examples.

First, the Chinese government can expropriate land to build modern cities and factories at almost no cost. All land in China is state-owned. The central government can disregard local residents and governments, acquire land at almost no cost, and then lease it to foreign companies at low prices, offering them extremely favorable terms. This is why foreign investment didn't favor China in the 1980s, but after China fully welcomed foreign investment in the 1990s, Western capital began pouring into China rather than India.

China has a household registration system, which acts as an internal colonization, discriminating against impoverished provinces in education and welfare. A child with a Henan hukou in China faces a much harder time getting into Tsinghua University than one with a Beijing hukou. Not only are the required scores higher, but the exams are also the more difficult Henan version. Chinese schools are also all government-controlled; there are no so-called private schools. Henan Province, according to the central government's plan, is an agricultural province. The central government has resorted to every possible means to prevent Henan residents from receiving higher education and becoming engineers and white-collar workers. This not only creates obstacles for Henan residents to attend universities outside Henan, but also prevents Henan residents from building their own schools. Henan, with a population of nearly 100 million, has only one key university, while Beijing, with a population of 20 million, has 34. Furthermore, to encourage Henan residents to remain farmers, the Beijing government has also created obstacles for Henan factory construction, preventing them from becoming workers instead of farming. Furthermore, due to the household registration system, even if a Henan resident has lived in Beijing for 20 years, it is difficult for their children to receive education there, unless they are high-ranking civil servants or intellectuals. Therefore, children of migrant workers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen often remain in their hometowns, separated from their parents. This effectively controls urban populations and prevents them from becoming overcrowded like New Delhi.

Similar situations occur in other provinces. For example, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia are mining provinces, but their resources have been used to build Beijing and Shanghai, leaving local residents with little benefit other than pollution. In the oil and gas-rich Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, natural gas prices have long been higher than in Shanghai because gas is prioritized for the eastern region. People from these regions, like those from Henan, face discrimination based on their household registration (hukou) when applying for university entrance exams compared to residents of Beijing and Shanghai.

In addition, China has severe ethnic discrimination policies. If you're Uyghur or Tibetan, you might be harassed by police five times a night in a Beijing hotel, making it nearly impossible to obtain a passport. While Mongolians won't be harassed by police, they will be punished by teachers for speaking their native language at school. Some companies will explicitly refuse to hire Mongolians. Incidentally, it's not just ethnic minorities; even Chinese speakers who speak Cantonese (the language used in classic Hong Kong films) or Wu (Shanghainese dialect) instead of Mandarin at school are also penalized. Using minority languages on social media in China can easily lead to investigation.

China does have relatively clean cities, having benefited from globalization by attracting foreign investment through preferential policies. I don't deny this, but it's important to note that the Chinese people bear the cost. Although the children of Shanxi and Henan eventually benefited from the crowd, building clean cities with funds earned from serving Beijing and Shanghai, the soil in Henan was severely polluted by fertilizers, and the soil in Shanxi was so contaminated with heavy metals that Beijing officials visiting these areas were afraid to drink local water and instead brought in imported mineral water.

Simply put, the Chinese government isn't a 1984-style dystopian society, but rather a bureaucratic capitalist state ruled by bureaucrats. After the Cultural Revolution, the country was ruled by technocrats from the intellectual class, such as Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao. These individuals used bureaucratic capitalism and their own planning to create China's economic miracle, similar to Park Chung-hee's ""Miracle on the Han River"" in South Korea. Private entrepreneurs appeared to have great power, but a single word from the emperor could destroy their families and their families. These individuals were evil and wicked, but they were highly educated bureaucrats with extensive grassroots experience in economic and industrial planning. However, they have now been replaced by the ""Red Aristocracy,"" represented by Xi Jinping, the children of the founding leaders of Mao Zedong's generation. Because Xi Jinping didn't complete secondary school during the Cultural Revolution, he technically only has an elementary school diploma. Consequently, China's economic policies over the past decade have been plagued by numerous missteps.

Furthermore, in recent years, the problem of wage arrears in China's infrastructure design and construction has become increasingly serious. Have you seen those beautiful cities? The companies that built them are likely bankrupt, and the owners have likely committed suicide.

I think the biggest difficulty in understanding foreign countries these days is that people tend to only care about what they care about.

For example, when the West exposed China's Uyghur concentration camps, they were most concerned about the Chinese government forcing Uyghurs to pick cotton, because this resonated with their understanding of pre-Civil War slavery. They paid no attention to the more serious rape and cultural genocide.

When Indians visit China, they are most concerned about cow dung and the animals on the streets. That's why they marvel at China's cleanliness. However, Indians, without experience living under a centralized system, often fail to appreciate the price paid to achieve these clean cities.

When Americans come to China, they are most concerned about immigration and drug issues, so they would feel surprised to see no drug addicts or homeless people lying on the streets. However, they would not know that beggars would be taken away by the police and sent to the suburbs for centralized detention.

There are no miracles in the world. If you want a government that recognizes private land and relatively respects individual rights, you have to accept that it cannot demolish the slums in the city center. If you want an efficient central government, you have to accept the possibility that it may give you a good job one day and take it away the next, or even forbid your children to speak their mother tongue.",1386,292,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1mri8fs/there_are_many_people_on_reddit_who_envy_chinas/,year,Unknown,0.88

We're talking about how the economic news matters to regular people: prices, interest rates, saving, and jobs. And we're not afraid to have some fun with it....

In our first episode – Shutdown S\*\*tshow – we discuss how the US shutdown is a symptom of larger fiscal problems that have spread to several major economies. These problems have big implications for future inflation and the value of your savings.

While I explain the macro policy picture, Jason offers an unsentimental perspective from the markets, and Jeremy keeps us both grounded. We're all focused on what the news means to you, not some billionaire planning their next trip to Pluto.

You can find Gross Domestic Provocation on Apple, Spotify, and other major platforms. Links are below. Please share and let us know what you think – feedback, questions, and suggestions are very welcome. We hope you enjoy!

1ny86iw,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 18:58:01,What would happen to Australian savings/investments if the US dollar defaults?,"Good day everyone,

I have a pressing question. With all of the news going around that the US dollar might default with the implementation of a new (digital?) currency, if this were to happen, how would this impact us in Australia? Specifically, how would it impact the value of our dollar and, subsequently, the value of our investments and savings that are based in the Aussie dollar and Aussie market? 

I don't want to live in fear, but I need to plan for a worst-case scenario. I a mostly blind and my mother's caretaker (we moved to Australia a few years ago), so I cannot, like most others in the world, afford to lose all the value of my money as it would devastate our future. I have been diversifying investments into non-Us and non-Aussie etfs, e.g., into European and Asian markets, into gold. But I do have the majority invested in Australia and ones that overlap with the US. So I want to build a long-term strategy that can account for both the best-case and worst-case scenarios.

I am aware that no one knows for certain what will happen, but I believe it is essential that we are cautious and prepared. Any informed insight and advice would be greatly appreocated. 

Thank you. ",1,2,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1ny86iw/what_would_happen_to_australian/,new,Unknown,0.6

The app listens to your voice and gives feedback on confidence, clarity, and tone. You can practice public speaking, mock interviews, or everyday conversation.

It’s been exciting to see people use it in ways I didn’t expect — like practicing pitches, conversations with friends, even dates.

I’m curious what the community thinks:
	•	Would a tool like this feel genuinely useful, or is it just a novelty?
	•	How do you test new apps or tools before fully committing to them?
	•	Any tips for getting honest early feedback from users?

***Photo above*** *– 81 year old Larry Ellison (founder of Oracle) saw his personal fortune soar $100 billion in a single day last month, when he teased that his company might have too many AI orders to fill on time. Accompanying octogenarian Ellison is Irina Osipova, a Ukrainian model who he began dating when she was 19.*  
  
Whenever corporate America decides that enormous scale is their only option, does disaster invariably follow? Was the 2008 housing crash caused by Wall Street and too-big-to fail-banks believing their best idea was jumping into the zero-down mortgages to bad FICO score applicants? Was the [dot.com](http://dot.com) crash caused by everyone believing that everything with “com” in its name was to die for, despite having zero profits? What should we expect next of the 7 AI companies on which much of the stock market value is underpinned?  
  
Do you feel safer, or get more worried, if you hear that the S&P 500 is valued (market cap) at nearly 4 times what the America’s entire GDP is? Should i be more concerned about egg inflation, or stock market inflation?  
  
The normal P/E ratio (price to earnings ratio) for a company’s stock is 10-15. (If you need the price-earnings 101 introductory course, please, google it.). How are the magnificent 7 AI stocks doing on that basis? NVDA is at 50 P/E. It has a market capitalization of $5 Trillion (with a T). Microsoft has a market cap of $4 trillion, and a P/E of 40. Apple also has a market cap of $4 trillion, and P/E of 40. Google (Alphabet) has a market cap of $3 trillion, and P/E of 30 – apparently, they’re a laggard ? Meta, Amazon, Oracle . . . the list goes on. Oracle’s company value rose **$200 billion IN ONE DAY,** and their PE is now 70. The trigger for this explosion? Founder Larry Ellison said they have a backlog of orders.  
  
Remember when [AOL.com](http://AOL.com), Ebay, and Geocities were must-have stocks?  
  
My hope is that all these high-flying AI stocks announce ever more fantastic products/updates. And these products are all excellent, and attract millions of satisfied users. That all the 7 survive, and our retirement accounts are not shot to pieces because we are invested in S&P 500 mutual funds, which is like buying AI as our main investment.  
  
I also had a dream that one day that America would reduce its $37 Trillion national debt, build affordable housing, and return the Social Security Trust fund to solvency. We all have dreams, right?  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

Theory in short: Tie US treasuries to stable coins THEN massively reduce the value of cryptocurrencies through regulation, propaganda, and severing ties to the treasury.

In other words a “rug pull” which is exactly how Russia framed it and it makes perfect sense to me. US debt is greater than 100% of the GDP, when Nixon pulled his stunt, it was only around 30%.

It’s all printed imaginary money propped up by pure faith. The more they print the less valuable our money becomes. The less valuable our money becomes the more we lose faith. So it seems like actions like this WOULD be crucial to sustain the economy. Especially makes sense if they have access to real numbers on job growth and employment while keeping us in the dark so that we will not panic.

I have my car parked elsewhere away from the storefront as to not arose suspicion. Anyway, I was able to hide under the sheets for the entire night. Before opening, I hid in one of the beautiful full sized cabinets. No one noticed me. I ate breakfast in the Swedish restaurant, and subsequently washed up in the bathrooms in the downstairs corner. I’ve been doing this for about two weeks now, saving a lot in rent in the mean time. However, I’ve had a few close calls. It started when I got addicted to the Swedish meatballs. In short, I got super plugged up, and started farting like crazy. Night time security almost caught me mid fart, so I had to hold a painful gassy one for 30 minutes. Luckily, the guard had fallen asleep in another corner of the store so they didn’t hear me erupt. Does anyone have any suggestions on where else to hide? I think they’re on to me after my farting escapade last Thursday.

Because if they had the same amount of children as their parents did, the costs of everything related to childcare (schools, college, medical, women staying at home etc.) would be much higher. Since they were such a large group, the effects of less people entering the workforce could easily be covered with migration.
I‘m a Millenial, my generation has even less kids. But the scheme doesn‘t seem to be working anymore. Would it financially be even possible, that our generation had as many children as required?
I feel like the wealth of the boomer generation and every generation after is more like a loan, we should have invested much more but spent it all on consumer products and cruise ship trips. And now this scheme doesn‘t work anymore, because we have less people entering the workforce but more entering the retiree group. Additionally,  migration with well educated people doesn‘t seem to be working forever.

This is not a rant on boomers, but might it be that this wealth was only possible due to very specific conditions in demographics? ",2,32,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nx4r94/is_the_wealth_of_the_west_based_on_declining/,new,Unknown,0.58

I was curious to know how these festivals impacted the local economy, since music festivals on the whole are struggling to stay in production and, sheeeesh, we are talking $300 million +

***Photo above*** *- Student protestors at the University of California are demanding free tuition. Governor Newsom is threatening to withhold $45 billion in existing funding. Can you predict how this will end?*  
  
**President Trump** \- *“Do as I say, or I’ll cancel your university funding!”*  
  
**Governor Newsom** – “*Me too. I mean, if you do what Trump sez, then I'm gonna cancel the state university funding.”*  
  
This is really happening. See link to San Francisco Chronicle, at bottom  
  
This is a power struggle for sure. Will Trump keep his word, and pursue his anti-woke, anti-antisemitism, anti-illegal alien student agenda?  
  
Or will Newsom get overruled by his state legislature? They might say *“Okay . . . enough with your 2028 campaign posturing. We are so NOT closing down all our colleges and universities. Take a deep breath, okay?“*  
  
This is a battle Newsom might lose. This does not mean I endorse Trump’s university viewpoints. Even if I understood them, and they weren’t changing day by day like tariffs (I just found the Apple iPad Air is exempt from tariffs even though it's assembled in Chengdu China, whose 5 auto plants are buried under those new tariffs).  
  
As far as havens from reality like Harvard and Columbia go, the only thing I’m certain of is that I support jailing or expelling students who attack suspected Jews on campus, or are cancelling classes, or who are trashing buildings. Stick to that one, Mr Trump. I don’t view campus unisex bathrooms for consenting adults as that big a deal. Let the pro-Muslim students explain why they want the kind of restrooms which probably offend Allah, while they're delivering a beat down to some guy wearing yarmulke.  
  
We are in day 3 of the US government shutdown. The stock market is still rockin’ it . . . the DOW is up 300+ points this week. The Nikkei Japan index was up nearly 2% yesterday. The London index (FTSE 100) up nearly 1% as well. None of this means that these places endorse our shutdown, or Trump's policies of course. Just that billionaires don’t believe the rhetoric both sides are spewing.  
  
The US government shutdown, like California college funding, isn’t about balancing budgets. It’s a power struggle to assert dominance of political ideology.  
  
It might be better to stay focused on the economics. Does anybody believe a $37 trillion national debt is sane? How about $45,000 tuition to the University of California? That’s like buying a Tesla Model Y and driving it off a cliff every year, for 4 years.  
  
We can have anything we want in America, as long as we can pay for. We can’t print fake money endlessly for things which most people don't understand or use.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

The big ugly fundamentally altered the priorities of the United States government. It cut about $1tn from healthcare programs, including Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, meaning that health insurance premiums for tens of millions of Americans will soar starting in January.

According to fool49:

It should be not a requirement to have health insurance, as it is now. If people get sick, they should be offered the option of free euthanasia. In India healthcare is corrupt, with false diagnosis, leading to unnecessary treatment and expenses. Furthermore it serves as a front for the authorities and their security services, to detain and torture people.

Yield curve: Historically one of the best predictors. Right now, the 10y–2y spread is positive (~+55bps), so it doesn’t scream “imminent recession.” The NY Fed model pegs 12-month odds around 20–30%.

Labor market: Unemployment has ticked up to ~4.3%, and hiring is slowing, but we’re not in freefall.

Inflation + Fed policy: Inflation is ~2.7–2.9%, and the Fed is shifting toward cuts, which usually reduces recession risk.

Debt + markets: Household debt is at record highs (~$18.4T), corporate leverage is heavy, and equities are at record valuations. This makes the system fragile — a small shock could tip it over.

So depending on which lens you use, you could argue:

Soft landing: <20% chance of recession.

Baseline slowdown: 25–35% chance, mild downturn.

Fragile system / shock-sensitive: >35% chance if leverage meets a trigger event.

My working view: ~30% probability of recession in the next 12 months, ~10–15% chance of a deeper/severe one.

What do you think is the most underappreciated factor in current recession risk? Is the yield curve still trustworthy in the QE/post-COVID era?

1nwt3ga,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 04:03:08,"NASA can be competitive with private companies, especially for more complex and scientifically innovative projects","According to FT:

Industry-built spacecraft were indeed cheaper, but only for lower-risk projects: the so-called Class C and D missions, where the scientific stakes are modest and the chance of failure is acceptable. Once the analysis moved up to Class A and B missions, the high-profile, flagship science projects where budgets balloon and timelines stretch, the difference evaporated. Nasa and industry came out roughly equal. In some cases, Nasa was cheaper.

According to fool49:

This article challenges the wisdom that private space companies are always overwhelmingly cheaper or more efficient, as compared to NASA. However it does confirm that for the simplest spacecraft private companies are cheaper. For the most complex projects NASA is competitive. You just have to think of all the failures and ballooning costs of Starship. 

And the government is involved even in the private economy. They develop many technologies, which private players get for free. Government agencies provide short to long term contracts and funding for private companies. Long term projects that require high R&D spending, requires parties that have patience and long term capital.

In addition the article explains that most space startups have failed, as most new businesses fail. And that having alternative suppliers of space launch systems, lowers risk and provides redundancy.

Offshore dollar credit exploded in the 2000s as global banks recycled U.S. deficits into loans abroad, embedding the dollar into every balance sheet from Brazil to Korea.

After the financial crisis, official liquidity backstops kept the system alive, though growth in offshore credit slowed even as the U.S. trade deficit deepened again. The pandemic brought another burst of dollar lending, reflecting both emergency funding and risk‑taking during stimulus, but, since 2022, the expansion has faltered while America’s external deficit has widened to historic extremes.

The divergence tells a structural story in that global demand for dollar funding is no longer scaling at the pace of U.S. external borrowing needs, tightening the hinge that connects Wall Street liquidity to Main Street trade flows.

1nw6e9k,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 11:08:52,Implications of a stock market detached from reality.,"I know that there's been a lot of posts about an overvalued stock market and a ""stock market bubble"" but I'm looking for opinions and serious discussion about what the implications to the economy are and what it actually means for everyday Americans.

My own view is that we are in a bubble, and that things may end badly.

Part 1: Are we in a stock market bubble? Many factors indicate yes.

* [Shiller PE ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe): now at levels only seen once before—the dot-com bubble.
* [Buffett indicator](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp-the-buffett-indicator/) (Market Cap / GDP): soaring past its all-time high.
* Extreme Valuations: e.g Palantir is trading at a 600+ PE ratio.
* Tech has risen nearly 50% since the April lows.

Part 2: What it means

Obviously, a growing stock market is generally a good thing, both for the country, as well as for the individuals invested in it. However, I am increasingly seeing a disconnect between the valuations and the state of the economy

* Job growth is at the lowest level in 15 years and unemployment rate is at the highest this year ([source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jobs-report-today-august-2025-three-takeways-federal-reserve/))
* US Dollar is continuously weakening (and projected to weaken more amidst fed rate cuts)
* Tariffs are at an all time high (maybe related to [0.4% MoM inflation](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/09/11/BLS-Consumer-Price-Index-inflation-joblessness/6251757604128/) in August which is still stick) 
* The government shutdown, and [gdp taking a hit ](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/bessent-shutdown-gdp.html)

Everyone likes seeing their stock portfolio go up, but what does it mean for the US economy if the underlying value is not there? QQQ took over 15 years to rereach its high of $118 after the dot com crash. On the one hand, prices today are this elevated because more Americans are invested in the stock market than ever before (and by a lot). On the other hand, this means that a crash will have the most widespread impact on Americans in history. I think we could be living in an unprecedented time and would like to hear everyone's thoughts on the best case as well as the worst case.

1nw3fqp,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 09:13:38,Poland launches deposit-refund system for drinks bottles and cans,"Poland has today launched a nationwide deposit-refund system for plastic bottles and metal cans, with the aim of ensuring more such packaging is recycled. Glass bottles will also soon be added to the scheme.

The system, similar to others already operating in many European countries, requires consumers to pay a deposit as part of the price when purchasing products in such containers. The deposit is then returned to them when they bring the packaging back to the store or another collection point.



For plastic bottles up to three litres in capacity and metal cans up to one litre, the deposit is 0.5 zloty (€0.12). For reusable glass bottles up to a capacity of 1.5 litres, the deposit will be 1 zloty from January 2026.

Containers covered by the scheme will have a special logo on them saying “kaucja” (meaning “deposit”) and the size of the deposit.

However, the climate and environment ministry notes that drinks with such markings will only appear gradually over the coming months, as producers and stores sell down existing stock and introduce the new packaging. Items without the logo will not be eligible for deposits.



After use, packaging with the deposit logo can be returned to any store over 200m² in size that sells beverages in deposit-refundable packaging; shops smaller than 200m² that sell drinks in reusable glass bottles; or any other stores that choose to join the system.

In stores, deposit returns can be handled either by employees or by automated machines. Meanwhile, there will also be automatic deposit machines placed outside some stores, while each of Poland’s almost 2,500 administrative districts (*gminy*) will have at least one public collection point.

No receipt or other proof of purchase is needed in order to return packaging. However, the climate and environment ministry, which is responsible for the system, emphasises that containers should not be crushed or damaged in any other way before being returned.

It is also possible for individual beverage producers to decide not to participate in the system, and instead to pay a fee themselves directly rather than collecting deposits for their packaging.



“The deposit-refund system is one of the steps that will allow us to achieve important environmental goals,” says deputy climate and environment minister Anita Sowińska. “We all want clean forests and beaches. We want our rivers, lakes and seas not to be filled with tonnes of plastic.”

Plans for the system were first [announced](https://notesfrompoland.com/2021/04/09/polish-government-plans-deposit-system-for-plastic-and-glass-bottles/) in 2021. The following year, the then government said it hoped to [launch the system in 2023](https://notesfrompoland.com/2022/06/03/poland-to-introduce-deposit-system-for-recycling-bottles-and-cans-next-year/). However, the process was subsequently [repeatedly delayed](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/04/11/delay-in-recycling-deposit-system-will-cost-poland-billions-in-eu-charges-warns-industry/) amid political wrangling and industry lobbying.

Now that the system is in place, it is likely to take Poles some time to get used to how it works – and get into the habit of saving and returning their bottles and cans.

An opinion poll by the IBRiS agency published last week by the Polish Press Agency (PAP) found that only 47% of Poles say they understand how the system works. A further quarter said they had heard of the idea but were unfamiliar with the details, while over a quarter had not even heard of it.",1,0,0,economy,reddit,https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/10/01/poland-launches-deposit-refund-system-for-drinks-bottles-and-cans/,new,Unknown,0.67

According to fool49:

OpenAI has overtaken SpaceX to become the most valuable private company in the world. As a kid I was very interested in computers and AI, and space and space travel and exploration. So I am very happy about the recent progress in generative AI, and private space companies. 

But SpaceX is an older and more mature company with 2 to 3 times the sales revenue of OpenAI. OpenAI is a software company, while SpaceX is a space hardware company.

I am not sure, but both have long term objectives. SpaceX: making humans a multi planetary species, including Mars. OpenAI: artificial general or super intelligence, though they may be more focused on incremental innovations like Agentic AI.

***Photo above*** *- During World War 2 cars and trucks were modified to run on coal, as an alternative fuel.*  
  
The docents and dowagers named Ford must be turning over in their graves right now. Ford Motor Company's CEO – Jim Farley - is presiding over a 50% drop in stock price. From $27 in 2022, when he ascended to the corner office, to $12 today. Ford’s 1 year future “target price” as estimated by Wall Street pro's is a further decline to $11.  
  
How could this happen?  
  
Mr. Farley blames “pesky” customers for not flocking to his $100,000 Ford F150 Lightning pickups (platinum trim). If $100K sounds insane, you can get a less heroic trim EV F150 for only $75,000. See link below. Okay, I can see a couple of problems here, Mr. Farley.  
  
First, somebody in accounting may have told you that EV tax rebates continue forever and would rise from $7,500 to $12,000. As long as the assembly line churning them out was staffed by UAW members. Various people in DC were talking this up, as if they could just print money endlessly.  
  
Second, somebody in Ford's sales department may have misplaced a digit, and overestimated the market size for $100,000 pickups. Electric vehicles are a thing with coastal elites. Those locations have the charging infrastructure. Farmers in Kansas? Not so much. If a farmer runs short on electrons, it could be a long way back to barn to plug in.  
  
So Ford is pivoting to hybrids, a decade after Honda and Toyota figured out this was the answer to range anxiety. Apparently, all new Ford, GM and Ram pickups will be hybrids. It’s not certain if they will still be “flex fuel”, and able to run on 85% ethanol. This was one of the byproducts of the 1992 Energy Policy Act. Almost immediately refineries began churning out more than 1 billion gallons of ethanol a year, as a consequence of government handouts to corn farmers. Even though there are actually almost zero filling stations where you can get E85. E85 capability became a feature, not a bug. on new pickup truck window stickers.  
  
As usual, I’m dissatisfied. I don’t want to throw tax money at farmers to produce ethanol instead of food for my dinner table. I don’t want perpetual tax incentives on $100,000 electric pickup trucks simply because someone covets UAW votes. I don’t want to wake up tomorrow and read that someone else has patented a pickup truck that runs on coal, and there’s a tax incentive on THAT now . . .  
  
Mr. Farley, you’re not the first CEO to get bamboozled by congress, your accountants, and your sales department. But Ford stock HAS declined 50% over the past couple of years. And you're almost 65 years old. Maybe this would be a good time to start retirement planning?  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

However with the new GST tax regime, luxury watches may face a high sales tax of 40% - but lower tariffs.

The Indians are allies of USA, as they share common values and interests, and a common enemy in China. So while things may look bad in the short term and in the press, eventually they will reach a mutually beneficial trade agreement. 

And EU will not want to be left behind, so they have been negotiating for about 18 years - let us hope that the EFTA agreement incentivises the EU to complete a trade agreement with India.

If companies are going to bring in talent from abroad, they'll make sure to pick the best of the best, but we’re missing the bigger picture: **we’re regulating the people who come here to work, while completely ignoring the massive amount of software development that’s being outsourced overseas.**

While we’re focused on regulating visa salaries, offshore labor now makes up nearly half of all software development in mid-to-large U.S. tech companies. **That’s millions of IT jobs and billions of dollars flowing out of the country** to India, Latin America, and Eastern Europe, while thousands of U.S. developers are getting laid off. On top of that, it's billions of dollars in lost tax revenue every year, money that is not being collected to fund the needs of the country.

[Average Annual Cost to Hire Offshore Developers \(2025\)](https://preview.redd.it/5fv2av3j1lsf1.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4b95ec30aca542fa05cfd696aa66d1e5b1cbfe9)

So, **why not impose tariffs/taxes on overseas labor**? We already do this with physical goods, **even basic necessities like food** facing tariffs of 20%, 50%, **even more than 100%** depending on origin.

Meanwhile, companies can outsource half their software development to overseas teams with **zero equivalent penalty**. No tariffs. No accountability. Just cheaper labor and bigger margins, while thousands of U.S. developers get laid off.

Look again at that table above and make the math, you pick whatever percentage you think is fair... and just for reference, there is a **250% tariff on Dairy products** (yes, like Milk and Cheese) imported from Canada.

>!My personal take would be to stop treating developers like rock stars and progressively align their salaries with other engineering fields, but at the same time heavily tax offshore labor to make local hiring attractive again. After months of unemployment, I doubt many developers would complain about a more reasonable salary when the alternative is no job at all.!<",0,4,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nvo28i/forget_the_h1b_debate_offshore_labor_is_stomping/,new,Unknown,0.47

1nvlyca,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 18:01:13,The falling foreign share of Treasuries and the Fed’s oscillating dominance show that U.S. debt absorption has moved from global savings toward central bank balance sheet management.,"The split between central bank balance sheet demand and foreign demand is ultimately the fulcrum of the Treasury market. Foreign ownership peaked just after the Great Recession, when recycling of U.S. current‑account deficits through official reserves made Treasuries the global savings sink. That structural bid has eroded as reserve accumulation plateaued, China diversified and oil exporters drew down savings.

The Fed filled the vacuum, first through QE waves that pulled its share to historic highs, then through QT phases that temporarily ceded ground before being forced back in by stress.

The recent picture shows a secular handoff, with the foreign share grinding lower while the Fed’s share oscillates around policy cycles. That means the Treasury market’s marginal buyer is no longer external surplus countries but the central bank managing domestic liquidity and collateral.

This, in turn, ties debt sustainability to policy credibility, makes the system more reflexive and leaves global linkages weaker.

***Photo above*** *- this is NOT the Versailles Palace, built for French King Louis XIV. It's the Pennsylvania capitol building in Harrisburg, where politicians are debating how to balance the state budget. Can you see the forest, guys?*  
  
Wow, for a guy (allegedly) running for president in 2028,, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro seems determined to tank his chances before the first debate even takes place. Because neither the Democrat controlled Pennsylvania state house or Republican controlled state senate can agree on a budget, so Shapiro’s solution is stop showing them relevant expense data. *“Your only job is to pass the budget. Just do it.*” (actual quote - see link below).  
  
I don’t think Shapiro is inspired by Trump here, although there are eerie parallels between the Federal budget (we just started a federal shutdown this morning) and Pennsylvania’s attempt to rein in their own out of control expenses. The highest paid state employee is apparently a guy named “James Grossman” earning $500,000. James flew under the radar until earlier this year. He’s the teachers pension fund administrator, and he earns twice as much as Governor Shapiro, who himself is apparently the highest paid governor in America.  
  
If you think the head teachers' pension fund guy SHOULD be paid a lot, I won’t debate this on Glassdoor metrics. But I will point out that Pencilvania's pension fund has been underfunded for 15 years (obligations far exceed assets) and would have been declared bankrupt if it weren't a government agency. If it were a bank, the FDIC would have closed the doors and liquidated it. Eventually this pension balloon is going to burst, probably requiring a state bailout.  
  
So maybe $500,000 a year to decide to run the pension fund’s $72 billion investment fund is fair. I'd do it for that salary, for sure. And - in the interest of public policy transparency - I would have put the whole shebang in an S&P 500 municipal fund. It would have earned 13.7% compounded return on average every year since 2010. The fund assets would be 600% higher than where they started in 2010. This would be WAAAAY more than Mr. Grossman was getting from the esoteric mix of “fixed income and corporate debt"" holdings being pushed on him by wall street smarties earning sales commissions.  
  
The answer to government budget problems isn’t to declare government salaries off limits for review, or officials’ free cars, or how much it will cost to refurbish the state capitol building in Harrisburg, with its 282 foot, 52 million pound dome. Hiding overspending never works. I really cannot give Shapiro, or Newsom, or AOC, or Pritzker a thumbs up for the 2028 presidential nomination. Just like the current president, they're all instinctive liars and over spenders.  
  
I’m just sayin' . . .

Workday is embedding AI into HR, finance, and analytics – helping businesses cut inefficiencies and make faster decisions.

This AI adoption is being seen as a blueprint for growth in enterprise software.

Early investors who spotted this trend benefited big.

It got me thinking – Workday isn’t alone. Similar companies leveraging cloud + AI (especially in HR tech, fintech, enterprise tools) could be the next breakout stocks.

Toyota and its Japanese peers have been slow to put high-tech EVs similar to those provided by BYD on the market, creating doubts over whether they can ever catch up. Auto industry insiders see a fundamental problem in the development speed for new models, which Masato Shoji, partner at Deloitte Tohmatsu in Tokyo, estimates to be six to seven years for Japan’s car producers compared with 18 months for some Chinese peers...

...""The one concern I have is software and autonomous driving technology,” says Yuzawa, who describes the Japanese groups’ slow progress as a risk rather than an immediate threat.

According to fool49:

Chinese not only have superior technology, they also have a superior much faster product development process. I don't see how Japan can catch up in EVs and SDVs, unless they change their business model. Right now Japan has large protected markets like India, USA, and home. 

But they must not get complacent and only design and build models for such markets, largely protected from Chinese competition. Automotive companies will have to transform, to technology and software companies.

The US government has shut down, after senators fail to agree on a last-minute funding bill - this is how we got here

Earlier, President Donald Trump threatened mass ''irreversible"" firings of federal workers if the shutdown went ahead

During the shutdown, the federal government stops all non-essential functions, while employees whose work is deemed essential, such as active-duty military members and federal law enforcement officers, are required to report to work, often without pay.

According to fool49:

Trump is planning to fire thousands of workers. When the government restarts it may be a lot smaller. And I don't think security workers, or anyone else, should have to work without pay. The last time the government shutdown was also during a Trump administration. I don't know if the democrats are being unreasonable and punishing Trump. 

Let us try an experiment on how the country functions without funding or services. I think we can survive without law enforcement. But how secure is the country without military. They shouldn't work if they are not getting paid. Unless the government makes a commitment to pay them for all their labour during the shutdown, when the government restarts.

***Photo above*** *- America's largest surviving coal fired power plant, near Macon Georgia. See the intense orange flames, proving those are NOT nuclear cooling towers? The plant uses 11 million tons of coal annually, all brought by train from Wyoming. That's 1 million railroad cars, if you're keeping count . . .*  
  
I haven’t seen a coal fired electric plant in years. The closest one to me is about an hour south, near Gibsonville Florida, off route 41. Never been there. America has been phasing coal plants out. President Trump wants to change all that. $600 million in taxpayer money will be used to reopen closed coal fired electric plants (see link below).  
  
If I can oppose government handouts for windmills - and billion dollar fusion reactors which don’t actually generate power – I can rant against handouts for coal strip mines and power plants too. More coal is the answer to a question nobody ever asked, except possibly miners in West Virginia and Wyoming.  
  
I’m all for more electricity. During a watch party for the Buccaneers game Sunday we were bombarded with several “AWS” ads – Amazon Web Services. Between AWS and Amazon’s half dozen AI projects there is a LOT of electrical consumption. Jeff Bezos refuses to disclose how much electricity his empire uses, but I’m going to guess it’s considerably more than what could be generated by $600 million worth of remodeled coal plants.  
  
The problem isn’t coal. Or AI, or server farms in general. Or nuclear power plants nearing the end of their useful lives. Or windmills which need to be torn down and thrown into the sea to become artificial reefs after their 25 year life expectancy is reached. Or dams which block rivers and prevent fish from spawning. The problem is that we – as consumers – always insist on more and more electrically powered conveniences, and the cheapest possible KwH cost to run these things.  
  
Remember when we were brainwashed that LED lights were so efficient that they were going to save us from needing new power plants? Government mandates forbade the construction of new homes with incandescent bulbs, and soon they were no longer even for sale at Home Depot. A single 60 watt (equivalent) LED replacement cost $9.99 back then. Hooray, we will earn back the purchase cost over 25 years if we use that bulb 2 hours a day.  
  
Today those same bulbs are available (from Amazon) for 90 cents each. Down from $9.99 each during the heady government mandate+stop climate change era. I possibly still have some of those $9.99 legacy LED bulbs in some of my lamps. And CFC twist bulbs, too.  
  
Government mandates and giveaways distort markets. Just like the cost of LED bulbs first went over the moon, then eventually came back to earth. Now those refurbished coal plants are going to make someone rich. Our government is picking winners and losers. Someone with a stake in coal has just become a winner, and someone with a stake in wind turbines was a loser earlier this year.  
  
  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

Quits are the mirror image of that under the skin of the labor market, rising only when workers have credible outside options.

When you put the spread and quits together, you get a clear signal of bargaining power moving through the cycle. The 2002–2007 upswing, for example, narrowed the spread without ever producing an explosive quits impulse, which is why wage growth never truly broke out.

Since the 2022 spike in quits — at which point marked peak worker leverage — the re-balancing has been textbook, with the U-6/U-3 spread drifting wider while quits have slipped toward their pre-2018 range, telling you that the jobs market still creates positions but with thinner option value for workers and a quieter wage-pressure channel.

A wider slack spread with subdued quits implies wage inflation cools even without a hard break in payrolls, which preserves room for disinflation to continue while keeping measured unemployment deceptively calm.",2,0,0,economy,reddit,https://i.redd.it/65cinb3mkasf1.jpeg,new,Unknown,0.75

1nu1q99,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 22:42:52,China official manufacturing PMI shrinks in Sept; Private PMIs positive.,"Chinese manufacturing activity shrank for a sixth consecutive month in September, official purchasing managers index data showed on Tuesday, while service sector activity also weakened. 

But a separate, private PMI survey showed both manufacturing and services activity growing much more than expected in September. 

Manufacturing PMI read 49.8 in September, government data showed. The print was slightly stronger than expectations of 49.6 and the prior month’s reading of 49.4. 

A reading below 50 indicates contraction, with China’s manufacturing sector having shrunk consistently since April this year. 

But private PMI data presented a different picture. The RatingDog China manufacturing PMI grew to 51.2 in September, more than expectations of 50.2 and above last month’s reading of 50.5. 

The print showed manufacturing growth at its strongest level in six months, and reflected a much sharper increase in exports than seen in the government data. 

The RatingDog PMI, formerly the Caixin PMI, differs from the government reading-- while the government print focuses more on bigger, state-run enterprises in the north, the private data covers smaller private enterprises in the south. 

Investors usually use both PMIs to gain a broader picture of the Chinese economy. 

While Tuesday’s readings did show some improvement in September, it still pointed to the manufacturing sector remaining largely under pressure from soft overseas demand, especially in the United States.",3,1,0,economy,reddit,https://uk.investing.com/news/economy-news/china-manufacturing-pmi-shrinks-for-sixth-consecutive-month-in-september-4284291,new,Unknown,1.0

The tariffs are set to apply from Oct. 14, with some increases targeted to take effect Jan. 1, according to a proclamation signed Monday. They follow a Commerce Department investigation into imports of lumber, timber and derivative projects that was launched in March.

Trump said the planned actions will “strengthen supply chains, bolster industrial resilience, create high-quality jobs and increase domestic capacity utilization for wood products.”

Yet home builders have warned they also could deter investments in new houses and renovations. That could blunt the effectiveness of Trump’s high-profile campaign to boost homebuying by encouraging the Fed to lower interest rates.

Canada stands to be hit hard by the order, as it’s by far the US’s largest wood supplier and it’s already subject to 35.2% duties meant to counter alleged subsidies and unfair pricing.

1nu0jsv,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 21:47:29,Shutdown Showdown,"This week will test the market’s ability to separate politics from fundamentals. The immediate driver is the September jobs report, which the Labor Department has warned will be suspended if a government shutdown begins on October 1. That puts traders in a unique bind; markets are forced to hedge not only against the jobs number itself, but also the possibility of no release at all. Historically, shutdowns lasting less than a week create modest equity drawdowns (−1% to −2%), while volatility (VIX) spikes +10–20% before fading once a deal emerges. With Trump openly signaling that Democrats will take the blame, and with both sides entrenched, the odds favor at least a short shutdown of 5–7 days.

For the S&P 500, this suggests a choppy, defensive week with a likely range of −2% to +1%, as investors await political clarity. The Nasdaq may hold up somewhat better, as any softer jobs tone or delay will ease pressure on yields; however, it will remain vulnerable to intraday swings, trading within a −2.5% to +1.5% band. The VIX will be the most telling instrument, expect an initial 8–15% surge early in the week, with the potential for another spike if a shutdown drags past October 3–4, followed by sharp mean reversion if a stopgap deal is reached by the weekend or early next week.

The broader takeaway: volatility is the trade, politics are the driver, and equities will only find footing once Trump can secure a symbolic “win” at home and allow negotiations to resolve.

**TLDR:** This week leans volatile and defensive — S&P 500 and Nasdaq will chop lower, while the VIX surges early before fading if a short shutdown is resolved by October 7–10.",2,6,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nu0jsv/shutdown_showdown/,new,Unknown,0.67

1ntjdwv,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 10:23:58,How do we deal with weak local government?,"A city government with limited resources has access to a local spring that could provide drinking water to tens of thousands of people at a very low cost. The same spring is also sought by a multinational bottling company with extensive legal teams, lobbyists, and campaign funding. The company is in a far stronger position to secure the rights.

Once the contract has been signed, the spring is effectively transferred from a potential public utility to a private input for global distribution. The city remains responsible for infrastructure such as roads, policing, and drought management, but no longer controls the water itself. Small municipalities rarely have the legal expertise or political leverage to demand high fees that reflect full costs.

A single truck driving the bottled water away already has an impact. Engineers measure this with the “equivalent single axle load” (ESAL). A single 80,000-pound semi can cause road damage equivalent to thousands of passenger cars. Now imagine dozens or hundreds of trucks. Even though the company is providing jobs which pay wages. The citizens earning those wages still have to go through local government. Meanwhile the local government won't even earn enough money to fix the roads. 

Citizens can then pay a ~200,000% mark-up to buy a bottle of water, while their roads turn to shit. How do we solve this issue while ""keeping government small"" ? Who is supposed to stand up in favor of the public good? In every single arena where the citizen can demand change, the company has more power. In the courts, in the chambers of power, in the newspapers. Hell, in the next election cycle, the politicians will brag about bringing new jobs to the area. They might even be rewarded for it, while they will now be subsidizing a billion dollar company.

So trade numbers don't give an accurate picture. One should look at value added. Tarrifs on particular countries will not necessarily result in reshoring, it could result in a shift of manufacturing from high tarrifs countries to low tarrifs countries.

1ntg6xz,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 08:05:51,This ratio shows which scarcity is in charge — financial hedging (gold) or physical barrels (oil).,"The crude oil-in-gold ratio is a purity test for scarcity, as it strips out the dollar and tells you whether the market is paying a security premium for financial hedges or a barrel premium for physical tightness.

When one ounce buys many barrels, the bid is in gold (that is, macro hedging, duration fear and liquidity demand), as the chart clearly illustrates, while upstream capacity and efficiency keep oil from commanding scarcity rents.

If, however, one ounce buys fewer barrels, energy tightness is doing the talking and inflation risk is coming from the pump rather than the “printing press.”

As of July 2025, one ounce of gold could buy 48.3 barrels of crude oil. That’s quite elevated, though it pales in comparison to the pandemic-induced 80 mark recorded five years ago.

This ratio outperforms narratives because it forces you to pick which scarcity the market is actually pricing.

Read it as a regime gauge: high barrels-per-ounce says financial anxiety is outrunning physical shortage; low barrels-per-ounce says the constraint is real-world molecules and logistics.

***Photo above*** *- The Simpsons, Season 7, Episode 7. Homer demonstrates a variety of techniques to feign productivity while working from home.*  
  
Let me admit – right from the start – that I don’t expect the mass firings (if they even happen) to make the tiniest dent in the national debt. It will be like a rounding error (less than 0.01%). So why are we even paying any attention to this, if it serves no greater purpose? Americans of all kinds – government workers, the homeless, substance addicts, teachers, first responders, voters in general – we are ALL just bargaining chips to career politicians who are scrambling to get re-elected again and again.  
  
But *“thousands of federal workers are terrified”* that they might lose their jobs. (see link below). Nobody is terrified that housing might become LESS affordable as the national debt soars, or that colleges continue to churn out students with irrelevant degrees who are functionally illiterate. Probably a few people are worried that defunding the police (and FBI, and ICE and homeland security) is going to result in more random shootings. Probably a few people are hoping this happens, as a way to get elected to a vulnerable senate seat.  
  
Let’s focus on the practical aspects of mass government firings, instead of the metaphysical ones. Imagine you were in charge of making a “short list” of people to be fired. (Full disclosure – I have been asked to help with this question a few times in the corporate world). Here are my recommendations, based on experience.  
  
1 – **First in line – anyone with excessive absenteeism and no bonafide medical situation.** This is probably the single biggest tranche of headcount that could be cut at every government level. Most federal, state, and local workers behave like they cannot be fired unless they commit a felony. Absenteeism, insubordination, and petty theft are off the menu as disciplinary triggers. Let’s start with these smirking wisenheimers.  
  
2 – **Those defying repeated “back to the office” mandates**. This applies equally to government and private sector workers. Especially if they have skills which mesh nicely with side hustles: coders, supply chain managers, attorneys, property management, accounting . . . it’s unbelievable how much time these people spend on their second laptop generating their second income, while clocked in. It is important to keep both laptops side by side so you can respond to work emails/texts, attend zoom meetings, etc. and convince everyone that are on the job.  
  
3 – **Vacant positions**. Most people have no idea how lucrative this target is for savings. Any position which has been vacant for longer than 90 days should be eliminated. If you don’t do this, the manager protecting that vacant position will sooner or later fritter it away by hiring a friend, relative, or relative of his/her superiors in the chain of the command. That is the reason that cube is vacant in the first place. The incumbent didn’t do anything vital, and neither will the successor.  
  
4 – **Anything the private sector does with a larger workforce, and for less money.** This is a mind boggling array of jobs. Federal gas stations and attendants for government issued vehicles. Janitorial and trash removal services. Couriers for non-top-secret documents and package delivery. Systems/web management. If you balk at this last one, ask yourself why government agencies get hacked MUCH MORE often than the private sector databases. The difference is that the government doesn’t tell us about those events, because they’re not required to. My mom's local library was hacked and held up for $1 million ransom. The administrators tried to keep it a secret. (Resolution - no ransom was paid and the files were rebuilt over 90 days by the same ""experts"" who allowed the intrusion in the first place)  
  
Okay, if your job appears as part of any of the above items, you probably should be “terrified”, as the article frets. But in reality, don’t worry. There won’t be any mass terminations. Both sides will strike a deal this week, because this is all a kabuki play, and the end game is public perceptions and votes.  
  
Remember, we are all just pawns.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

World models are trained using data streams of real or simulated environments. They are viewed as an important step in pushing forward progress in self-driving cars, robotics and so-called AI agents, but require a huge amount of data and computing power to train and are considered an unsolved technical challenge.

According to fool49:

We are reaching the limits of generative AI and LLMs. As LLMs are trained on most data publicly available. To have a better understanding of the world, AI models need to be trained on multi modal data. World models are the next step in AI. But I didn't read any mention of embodied intelligence. That is when AI is placed in like a robot where the intelligence interacts with a physical environment. With the intelligence including world models.

I think a combination of multi modal generative AI with world models embodied in a robot is the next step. But robots can be very expensive with limited mobility and dexterity, and inability to adapt to unstructured environments. Computing has been coming down in costs while increasing in power following Moores law; data, bandwith, processing power all have been growing exponentially. While progress in robots is much slower, we can only hope that simple humanoid robots become cheap, with mass production, and adoption in homes and businesses. Accelerating progress in intelligent machines.

If the deplorables who fear intelligent machines, don't adopt them, then the lead will be taken by countries more welcoming. Especially in Asian countries like Japan, and China. The Luddites will hold back technological and economic progress with their unreasonable fear of machines.

P.S. Everytime I discuss AI, I get downvoted, so I know most participants in this forum, are biased against AI; I hope AIs take your jobs, and those who are more welcome to AIs prosper.

“A 25bp cut is more likely in November, taking the policy rate to 3.35% for an extended period,” ANZ analysts said in a recent note, adding that Governor Michele Bullock was widely expected to reiterate the central bank’s data-driven stance on further easing, after about 75 bps of cuts so far in 2025.

The China bloc is smaller, and includes many authoritarian and poor countries, including countries rich in commodities.

Where does this leave India? The quick answer will be to remain neutral as it did during the cold war. But India can benefit from an alignment with USA. Even as it will become the third largest economy within a decade. It is not interested in projecting power abroad, or leading a bloc of countries. India has a large trade deficit with China, and a small trade surplus with USA. Best is if India remains neutral, but if forced to choose, it would prefer the USA along with EU. For flow of knowledge, goods, capital, and people. And because India shares values and interests with USA.

1nsx98h,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 15:29:13,🚀 Wall Street Radar: Stocks to Watch Next Week - vol 57,"**Weeks That Take Skin**

It was the kind of week that makes you talk to screens. Not prayers, bargains.

We spent most of it hunched over prices like mechanics over a stubborn engine, day‑trading a couple of names just to drag Friday into the green by its collar. Nothing humiliates quite like survival mode. You’re not building, you’re just bailing.

Trust? Thin. We don’t trust this market, and the market knows it.

Full article and watchlist [HERE](https://www.gb.capital/p/wall-street-radar-stocks-to-watch-vol-57)

We’re moving super cautiously, the way you walk across black ice pretending you’re not. Our job is simple and ugly: participate until the gauges light up red, and then breathe, regroup, sharpen. Not before. Not after. When Energy and Utilities are wearing the relative‑strength crown, you don’t whine that the party feels off; you pat your pockets, keep your shoes on, and stay near the door.

The portfolio shifted hard. We raised both **CRWV** and **ENPH** to break‑even stops and got tossed. Right call. They’d been loitering, doing nothing but charging rent on our attention. No harm, no shame. The best trades make you feel clever; the right trades often make you feel nothing.

**ATAI** gave us a head rush: up more than 35% in a blink. We sold 30% into strength like adults and welded the stop to break even. Maybe it holds, maybe it doesn’t. The company’s interesting, the tape says biotech’s one of the few industries not lying to itself. Hope is not a thesis. A stop is.

**OKLO**: We sang our last note on Friday. Seventy‑five percent in short order. You don’t complain about a win like that. You log it, nod once, and refuse the victory lap. Recent best, yes. Proof of immortality, no.

Then there’s **CROX**. Friday’s HeyDude x Sydney Sweeney splash hit, and we slid in, not because celebrity endorsements save souls, but because the risk/reward answered without stuttering. Solid company, heavy shelf of support at 74–75, a clean break of the recent daily downtrend, and volume almost doubled. We took it with a wide stop and a smaller size; this isn’t a two‑day fling if it’s going to matter.

**LTRX** is the bruise you keep pressing. We bought the breakout that never arrived. The stock’s pacing a channel like a caged cat; our thesis dies if it slips the lower rail, and we’re already hearing the lock rattle. We gave it room on purpose, not out of mercy. The room is expensive. So is denial.

Macro mood music: VIX down, T2118 down, T2108 ticking up. The market’s bouncing. In two weeks, we’ll learn if this is a dead‑cat hop into a lower high or the coiling that slings us to fresh records.

Feels fifty‑fifty: an honest coin flip, the most dangerous odds in trading because they whisper that you’re supposed to guess. We won’t. We’ll react.

That’s the whole blueprint, unromantic and true:

* Respect the drift even when it insults you.
* Sell into strength because gravity is patient.
* Put the stop where your thesis ends, not where your feelings begin.
* Trade what’s in front of you, not the story you wanted.

We’ll show up again on Monday with knuckles uncurled and rules intact. If the bounce grows teeth, we’ll feed it. If it rolls under and shows belly, we’ll cut the risk and let it play dead without us.

Either way, no speeches, no hero shots. Just the work, done tight, while the market decides whether this was the week it took skin or the week it taught us how to keep it.",1,0,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nsx98h/wall_street_radar_stocks_to_watch_next_week_vol_57/,new,Unknown,0.67

1nstyj7,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 13:20:03,"Citizens’ budgets are quietly transforming Poland’s cities, towns and villages – and leading the way in Europe","**By Callum MacRae**

Wisława Szymborska Park in Kraków opened just two years ago, but Cracovians have already come to know and love it as a precious area of public green space right at the heart of the city.

And it is Cracovians themselves who are responsible for the creation of the park, which was funded through a so-called “citizens’ budget”, under which residents can propose, discuss and vote on projects to be implemented using municipal funds.

Poland has become a global leader in this kind of participatory budgeting. Today, more than 50% of such schemes in Europe are found in Poland, where participatory budgeting is now mandated by law for every major city and has also been adopted voluntarily in many smaller municipalities.

The result has been the beginnings of a minor revolution in local governance, with the steady spread of citizens’ budgets quietly remaking villages, towns and cities.

# The roots of citizens’ budgets in Poland

Poland’s experiment with participatory budgets began in 2009 with the Solecki Fund. While such schemes are most often conceived in the urban context, the Solecki Fund was targeted at small rural administrative units (in Polish: *sołectwa*), allowing them to request that a portion of the local budget be allocated to participatory budgeting.

The programme saw [considerable success in its initial years](http://funduszesoleckie.pl/index.html@p=457.html) (almost half of those eligible made use of the scheme in its first year), and continues to shape local governance in rural Poland, with [around two thirds](https://www.gwsh.pl/content/biblioteka/org/zeszyty/ag/zn20/ZN20AG_11Wojewodzic.pdf#:~:text=Field%20research%20conducted%20in%202023%20and%202024,of%20life%20in%20rural%20and%20urban%20areas.) of the country’s almost 41,000 *sołectwa* today incorporating some form of participatory budgeting under the Solecki Fund.



With the precedent set at the rural level, participatory budgeting soon spread to urban government after Sopot introduced the first city-level citizens’ budget scheme in 2011.

“Slowly, more cities began implementing it as a form of civic celebration, as councillors in municipal and city councils demanded participatory budgets,” says Jarosław Kempa, an economist at the University of Gdańsk and a member of Sopot city council since the introduction of the original scheme in 2011.

From 2014 to 2019, the number of cities and towns running some form of participatory budget [grew almost tenfold](https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/pp/article/view/46722/38233), from 35 to 320. When in 2019 citizens’ budgets became a statutory obligation for all cities with urban district (*powiat*) status, for most this was a matter of legal frameworks playing catch-up.

The schemes are even popular in towns where the legal requirement does not apply – in 2022, [43.5% of municipalities with a population greater than 5,000](https://obserwatorium.miasta.pl/biblioteka/barometr-budzetu-obywatelskiego-edycja-2022/) implemented a citizens’ budget.

# The impact of citizens’ budgets

Across the past 15 years, citizens’ budgets have become a powerful means for local democratic engagement in Poland.

“The initiative to establish a participatory budget in Sopot was an attempt by local government to offer pragmatic dialogue and engage the local community in the decision-making process,” says Artur Roland Kozłowski, a political theorist at WSB Merito University in Gdańsk. As the schemes spread after Sopot’s success, they became “a tool for genuine social activation and inclusion”.

Wisława Szymborska Park is a powerful symbol of the potential of these schemes to transform local economic decision-making.

Until 2019, when the proposal to build the park was submitted, the land on which it now sits was a (poorly kept) car park. The citizens’ budget gave residents of Kraków the opportunity – in a city [plagued by some of the worst air quality levels in Europe](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/12/07/polish-city-records-worlds-second-highest-air-pollution-as-winter-smog-sets-in/) – to consider how else they might like that land to be used.



Moreover, this symbolic power is only heightened by the presence of the former site of Dolne Młyny – once a popular hub for bars, restaurants and exhibition spaces located in a former tobacco factory – which sits across a street to the west of the park.

Despite concerted local opposition, the investors who owned the land on which Dolne Młyny sat [evicted the tenants in 2020](https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/09/18/krakows-post-industrial-nightlife-and-culture-hub-forced-to-close-as-developers-move-in/), with plans to build a luxury apartment and hotel complex that are yet to materialise.

Sitting amid the tranquil trees of the park and gazing across the road, the contrast can feel stark. On one side of the street, citizens have come together to turn a rundown car park into a thriving and much-needed public park.

On the other, the wishes of the local community were circumvented, and a well-loved cultural and entertainment space made way for (yet more) [unaffordable housing](https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/09/02/warsaw-now-more-expensive-than-rome-as-poland-sees-europes-fastest-house-price-rises-in-2024/).



Furthermore, Wisława Szymborska Park is just one of an ever-growing list of participatory budgeting success stories from across Poland: repairs to roads and pavements, new parks, more trees, cycle paths, sporting events and training sessions, public concerts, classes and workshops.

As a resident of Kraków, I frequently make use of citizens’ budget-funded parks, I train and race twice weekly with a citizens’ budget-funded running club, and I witness regular citizens’ budget-funded improvements to basic infrastructure in my local neighbourhood.

In 2024, [163 different projects were funded in Kraków](https://budzet.krakow.pl/aktualnosci/288152,1909,komunikat,wyniki_glosowania_2024.html), from an original list of 1,100 proposals, with a total of 46 million zł (€10.8 million) allocated for implementation.

Taken together, such amenities constitute the lived environment that forms the backdrop against which our lives unfold. Through the citizens’ budgets, residents of Poland are increasingly afforded the opportunity to shape this backdrop to better meet their needs and wants.

# Poland is setting the example in Europe

Interest in participatory budgeting has not been confined only to Poland in recent years. But the extent to which these schemes have become a systematised part of local governance marks the country out from its EU neighbours and beyond.

“Probably nowhere else in the world has this idea permeated such a wide cross-section of different communities and types of administration,” explains Kamil Orzechowski, CEO of Mediapark, a company that develops digital platforms to support local governments in collecting citizens’ budget project submissions and conducting votes.

“The idea of participatory budgeting in Poland has gone far beyond the standard approach, from the micro to the macro scale, from small villages and municipalities with a few thousand inhabitants, to towns, cities, and even entire provinces.”



Orzechowski attributes some of this remarkable success to the idiosyncrasies of Poland’s local government structures, particularly a series of reforms in the 1990s which gave municipalities and cities broad powers over their own budgets.

“The participatory budget was therefore not an empty gesture: it gave citizens the opportunity to make real decisions about the distribution of real money,” he says.

But some of the credit must also go to those residents who participate in the schemes, often in impressive numbers.

“The example of Częstochowa, where 800 projects were in 2024 submitted in a town of approximately 200,000 inhabitants, is astonishing,” Orzechowski notes, adding that statistically, that means there was one idea for every 250 inhabitants.

# There is still room for Poland’s citizens’ budgets to expand

Despite these successes, the Polish scheme is not without its limitations. Most obviously, when compared with some participatory budgeting in other countries, Poland’s citizens’ budgets cover a relatively limited amount of local government finance – generally under 2% of the total budget.

Polish law requires a minimum of only 0.5% of the total budget to be allocated, whereas in Brazil – whose Porto Alegre scheme is often credited as the beginning of the modern participatory budget movement – the figure is [typically between 2 and 10%](https://partycypacjaobywatelska.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/faqqpp.pdf), and in some cases even higher.



Moreover, though the extent of their proliferation through Polish society has been impressive, there is still room for more growth. Putting aside larger *powiat* cities, far fewer of Poland’s smaller municipalities (*gminy*) currently implement citizens’ budgets.

“Participatory budgets have been implemented in approximately 13% of *gminy*, or around 320 out of 2,477,” Kozłowski explains. “The need to introduce mandatory participatory budgets in municipalities and cities without *powiat* status should be considered.”

Though these limitations are significant, the existing legal infrastructure creates a national framework for future reforms – so long as the political will exists to implement them. And, as Kozłowski points out, this will depend on who is in government at the national level.

“Increasing the size of participatory budgets requires a stable financial policy from the central government, which was not forthcoming under \[former ruling party\] Law and Justice (PiS),” he says, adding that their “focus on limiting local government funding served to undermine openness to increasing the size” of citizens’ budgets.

# An optimistic vision of Poland’s economic future

As well as providing a clear institutional pathway to extending the policy, the success of existing citizens’ budgets illustrates why more ambitious schemes are worth fighting for.

In Kraków, as one passes the boarded-up development site of Dolne Młyny and enters the peaceful gardens of Wisława Szymborska Park, two different visions of how Poland’s economy might work in the coming decades are offered – one in which unaccountable investors call the shots, and one in which important funding decisions are made directly accountable to local citizens.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) savings and real debt tracked each other in rough proportion, reflecting a system where household thrift and public borrowing were still bound by a common ceiling.

But the divergence started in the 1980s, as deficits compounded without a parallel rise in savings.

And the real break came after 2008: debt issuance outpaced the capacity of the household sector to accumulate real deposits, leaving monetary assets dwarfed by government liabilities.

The pandemic made this imbalance visible in extreme form, as savings briefly surged but were rapidly eroded by inflation while debt continued to march higher.

The result is a system structurally dependent on institutional balance sheets and foreign buyers to absorb public borrowing, with households no longer providing the ballast.

That shift matters for interest rate dynamics, for financial stability and for the sustainability of fiscal dominance: the private cushion has thinned, and with it the margin of safety in the domestic savings base.

***Photo above*** *- local Albuquerque residents break open a few cold ones to celebrate $800 million in tax breaks awarded to a proposed nuclear power plant.*  
  
People in Albuquerque are cheering. Pacific Fusion has selected New Mexico for its $1 billion nuclear fusion plant. New Mexicans aren’t going to see any actual electricity from this new plant, however. It will CONSUME power instead, because this is just an experiment, not a working reactor. See [ABQjournal.com](http://ABQjournal.com) link below.  
  
I had never heard of “Pacific Fusion” before this morning, so I googled them. Wikipedia has never heard of them either. The closest I came to authentic financial data was the link at bottom, to the Financial Post. A year ago Pacific Fusion's first mention was: “unknown startup nabs $900 million from venture capitalists”. They have zero plants until today's announcement. The Albuquerque location will be their first. And New Mexico taxpayers have become venture capital investors to the tune of $800 million.  
  
Although I am clearly ridiculing the use of tax dollars to propel venture capitalists’ schemes, please note that I am NOT dissing fusion power itself. Even though we've had dozens of claims of fusion breakthroughs over the last decade, and so far no device that produces more kilowatts than it consumes. The Albuquerque plant will do exactly the same.  
  
Remember the tickertape parades and popping champagne corks when some college professor announced he had invented “cold fusion”? That sounds significantly safer than the device proposed for Albuquerque, which will operate at 150 million degrees Celsius – hotter than the center of the sun. Has anybody checked out if that will add to global warming? And if a fusion reactor melts like a broken Fukushima or Chernobyl containment vessel, will it ""safely"" sink into the center of the earth, so it doesn’t harm anyone? What happens when a 150-million-degree fireball reaches the center of our planet, which is only 10,000 degrees? That core will be more than 1,000 times hotter than the lava at there. I hope this isn't one of the experiments Pacific Fusion has planned for its new plant.  
  
I am not inherently against fusion experiments, whether cold, or room temperature, or hotter than the sun. I am not against wind turbine farms, solar farms, tidal power, thermal generation from magma fissures, microwave beams pointed at us from orbiting satellites. I just don’t want my tax dollars given to billionaire venture capitalists to make money off these things.  
  
Let the venture capitalists and/or shareholders bear ALL the risk. Unless someone holds a vote and America's Amazon drivers, public school teachers, and soybean farmers sign up to have their tax dollars involved. Don't leave these decisions in the hands of the local mayor and city council. They're simply lawyers and former school board members who can't even keep the water supply running safely.  
  
But I personally won’t be on the hook for a dime this time. Residents of Albuquerque, this one’s totally on you. But consider breaking ground on a new fire department located near this research hotspot. Just in case 150 million degrees has unintended consequences no one anticipated. We’ve never actually been to the core of the sun you know, so whatever's happening there is strictly a matter of conjecture. And ask the people of Fukushima and Chernobyl what happened their mayors invited ""normal"" nuclear reactors to their towns.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

Will machines make humans useless. Despite the claims of leftists, humans aren't equal. Most humans will become dependents relying on the state to feed clothe and house them. However there will be a minority of humans, who create original art, and transform business and society. Will ordinary humans become powerless, will democracy survive?

Perhaps the only way to save humanity, is with machine augmentation and genetic engineering, where they are able to successfully compete with machines and live alongside them.

Pitted against the VCs, the AI models came out on top. For context, top firms broadly get it right one time in 20. But some LLMs did much better. OpenAI’s GPT-5 correctly picked a winner half the time. China’s DeepSeek-V3 beat the lot, able to single out a future success story six times out of 10. It was also able to do so more cheaply than most other models.

According to Fool49:

I don't think generative AI is quite ready to work independently and replace venture capitalists. But certainly give them a run for the money. What worked in the past, won't work in the future.  But I think it can create a shortlist of entrepreneurs to invest in, for review by VCs. And it might make us rethink venture capitalism. Maybe investors, instead of investing only through VCs, can also use generative AI to directly invest in startups and their founders.

At its core, it tells you whether the banking system is functioning as a credit engine or as a distribution channel for government debt.

The fact that the ratio has never regained its early-1970s high is the fact that regulation, capital charges and liquidity rules over the years have tilted balance sheets toward Treasuries, while loan demand is increasingly met outside banks through private credit markets.

The consequence is that fiscal issuance, not private lending, increasingly dominates how banks deploy their balance sheet. Of course, that reshapes the transmission of policy.

1nrwbfk,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 10:14:26,Left calls for law guaranteeing free tap water in restaurants in Poland,"The Left (Lewica), which is part of Poland’s ruling coalition, has proposed legislation that would require restaurants to provide free tap water to diners. “Water is a right, not a commodity,” says the group.

However, its proposal has already been met with opposition from a government minister hailing from a different part of the ruling coalition, who says that it is “not the right time yet” to introduce such an obligation.



While in many countries it is standard for restaurants to offer tap water if requested – or sometimes even to simply bring it to tables unrequested – in Poland the practice is rare. Indeed, many people remain suspicious of drinking tap water in general.

On Wednesday, deputy infrastructure minister Przemysław Koperski, who hails from The Left, announced that his group had submitted proposed additions to a planned amendment of Poland’s law on water supplies and sewage disposal, which is already intended to further improve drinking-water standards.

Among the newly proposed measures is the introduction of a requirement for restaurants to provide half a litre of tap water for free to every person who orders food.



Other elements include ensuring free access to drinking water in public places, improving the quality of tap water, introducing a rapid warning system if any contamination of water supplies is detected, and helping provide access to running water for those who do not currently have it.

Announcing the measures in parliament, Piotr Kowal, a Left MP, said that it is important to promote drinking tap water because it is more environmentally friendly than consuming water from plastic or glass bottles, reports the Polish Press Agency (PAP).

A number of cities in Poland have in recent years run campaigns encouraging residents to drink tap water, which they note is safe, as well as being cheaper and more environmentally friendly than bottled water.



The Left’s proposals were, however, rejected by infrastructure minister Dariusz Klimczak, who comes from the centre-right Polish People’s Party (PSL), another member of the ruling coalition.

“I don’t think it’s the right time yet, and I won’t support this type of solution,” Klimczak told Radio Zet. “Not all places in Poland have tap water. I wouldn’t want to impose on businesses that you have to give it away for free from now on.”

“We currently have bigger problems on our hands with water: flood control measures, drought control measures, decentralisation of \[state agency\] Polish Waters,” he added. “Once I’ve dealt with that, I’d be happy to discuss free water at restaurants.”



The entire draft amendment to the water law – including The Left’s proposed additions – has now passed to the parliamentary committee on local government and regional policy, which will continue work on the legislation, reports the *Dziennik Gazeta Prawna* daily.

Among other measures included in the bill – which is intended to bring Poland in line with the EU’s Drinking Water Directive – are more stringent quality parameters for drinking water and requirements for water companies to provide customers with clearer data on prices and consumption.

There will also be greater responsibilities for property owners to conduct periodic risk assessments of water supplies and easier online access to up-to-date water quality information for residents.",6,0,0,economy,reddit,https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/09/26/left-calls-for-law-guaranteeing-free-tap-water-in-restaurants-in-poland/,new,Unknown,0.87

This would mean that creating new currency causes the devaluation of all the currency in circulation. This is the argument for why new government debt causes inflation.

I encountered a few historical examples that makes me question this simplistic view on the causes of inflation.

1. Roosevelt and the New Deal 
During the Great Depression Roosevelt created government debt to finance infrastructure projects and thus creating jobs to revive the economy. This did not cause a spike in inflation or higher inflation in the years after.

2. Japan
Japan has a very high debt/gdp ratio and also spent a lot of money sourced from debt. It hasnt seen a spike in inflation. It rather is in a phase of deflation.

3. The GFC in the US
After the collapse of the banking sector and the financial crisis that followed, the government printed money to bail out banks and stimulate the economy. The US hasnt seen a high inflation period in the 2010s.

I am sure there are more examples of government spending not triggering inflation.

A different argument that speaks against the thesis of money printing being responsible for inflation is the data. If the thesis was true, then a spike in debt/gdp or deficit would come (or followed by) an increase of the inflation rate. There should be a high correlation or correlation with lag. I looked at several developed countries and could not see that (I haven't done a statistical analysis of time series yet but I might do this if I find the time). 


So there is a lot of data that does not speak for the theory that has been supported by most economists (for example Milton Friedman).

Let’s get caught up to speed, for the benefit of everyone still obsessing over Epstein and Charlie Kirk:  
  
**Trump** (to planet): “You’re all going to pay huge tariffs on everything. I will change the amounts daily. Bwaaaah!!!”  
  
**China** (to US): “Please cancel our US soybean purchases for 2025. We’ll let you know later about 2026”  
  
**Farmers** (to Trump): “We need a $47 billion bailout because now China is buying all its soybeans from Argentina”  
  
**Trump**: “I’m going to bail out Argentina’s economy. Make Argentina Great Again. And here’s a new tariff on kitchen cabinets, in case anyone was thinking of remodeling.”  
  
The silver lining: at least no talking heads will appear on CNN and PBS wringing their hands over soybean inflation in America’s supermarkets. Stop laughing - all of this is true. See link at bottom.  
  
If you had asked me to guess the value of the annual US soybean crop, I’d have said anywhere from $1 billion to $1 trillion. If you asked me how much of America’s farmland is devoted to soybeans, I’d have been equally helpless. Turns out it’s 85 million acres, equal to the combined land mass of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and Delaware. See second link at bottom.  
  
That is a LOT of farmland devoted just to grow soybeans. What does China do with all of these beans? If you said “tofu” (curdled soy milk, congealed to impersonate cheese) you’d be wrong. China mostly feeds our soybeans to their pigs. Which in turn become pork egg rolls, sweet and sour spareribs, and possibly bacon.  
  
I’m okay with this, if it keeps China from harvesting wild bats and selling them alive in “wet markets”, which THEN ends up infecting half the world with the Covid 19 virus. If that’s the way it actually happened, and the pandemic WASN’T a leak from their Wuhan military experimental virus lab . . .  
  
**Let’s cut to the chase.** I wish no misfortune on America’s farmers. But those 85 million acres are probably put to better use feeding America, rather than fattening pigs to feed a global adversary which is constantly hacking America’s airports and banks, threatening to invade Taiwan, and torturing it’s Nobel peace prize winners in prison.  
  
Can we have a conversation about putting America first (not China or Argentina) and keeping our own people fed and housed?  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

I’m currently preparing my undergraduate thesis on the role of drug money in the 2008 financial crisis.

Since the link between illegal money flows and the shadow banking system is still a relatively underexplored field (with limited academic coverage), I’m looking for serious sources to deepen my research. Beyond the well-known cases of Wachovia and HSBC, are there any major investigative reports, long-form journalism pieces, or reliable communities/forums where I can gather insights?

The goal is to build a solid foundation without sounding speculative in front of my professors — so I’m especially interested in credible investigative journalism, financial watchdog reports, or discussions in expert forums rather than conspiracy theories.",3,3,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nrral0/drug_money_and_2008_crisis_thesis/,new,Unknown,1.0

🌽 Maize area ↑ 17% (9.8M hectares, 5-year high)

🌶️ Red chilli exports ↓ 32% this year

Ethanol blending hit 19.8%, with corn now supplying 52% of ethanol


Corn offers higher profits (₹28k/acre vs ₹8k for chillies), shorter crop cycles, and 30–40% less water use. Meanwhile, chilli farmers are hit by collapsing prices, water scarcity, and falling exports.

This shift isn’t just about crops — it’s about policy-driven change reshaping India’s agriculture.

1nrmx72,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 01:17:59,AI leading to jobless growth,"According to imf.org:

The question is whether all this start-up activity is contributing significantly to job growth. Recent research published by the Federal Reserve suggests that the recent wave of start-ups is less likely than previous upsurges to contribute to employment growth. Young, high-growth start-ups accounted for less than 6 percent of employment in 2024, compared with almost 10 percent in 1985, according to the Fed. AI tech–driven start-ups tend to be capital- and skill-intensive, requiring fewer workers.

Productivity and wage increases manifest in the highest-skilled workers; automation reduces the wages of those engaged in routine tasks. Economic dynamism—whereby new businesses boost economic growth—may well reflect not so much large start-ups employing large numbers of workers as an increase in the number of start-ups, each one spawning more such firms thanks to a boost in the region’s risk-taking culture.

According to fool49:

AI will benefit high skilled workers, who can develop, manage, or use AI solutions. As for the deplorables, their numbers and wages will probably remain stagnant. Everyone should have the opportunity to reach their full potential. For the smart or hard working few, it may mean high paying and meaningful work. For the ignorant or lazy majority, it may mean low paying and meaningless work.

Which side are you on?

We graduate knowing mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell — but not how compounding interest makes or breaks your savings. That’s backwards.

History →
Because cycles repeat. Inflation today looks a lot like the 1970s. Debt blowups? Seen them before. If you know the playbook, you’re less likely to be blindsided.

Finance →
Because your wallet is the frontline. Credit cards, loans, compounding, budgeting — this is the difference between building wealth or sinking into debt.

Econ 101 →
Because GDP (Gross Domestic Product), inflation, and trade aren’t abstract. They decide your rent, your wages, your taxes, and whether your job survives the next cycle.

And yes, crypto belongs here too →

Not as a lottery ticket, but as part of the financial landscape you’ll need to understand. If you’re just starting out, a simple plan is DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) into the required holdings: BTC (Bitcoin) and ETH (Ethereum). Beyond that, satellite positions in SOL (Solana), LINK (Chainlink), and newer smart contract plays like Ether.fi are higher-risk, higher-potential bets.

The bigger picture →

You need a diversified financial planner mindset. Not a mutual fund salesman, not a pure-crypto influencer, not a day-trader, and not just another newsletter. The advisor you want in today’s world is one who actually sees the macroeconomic picture — interest rates, energy shocks, currency shifts, inflation cycles — and helps you adjust across stocks, bonds, commodities, crypto, and cash. Too many people blow up their portfolios chasing one lane. The real edge is having guidance that integrates it all, so you’re protected when the cycle turns.

Takeaway

“If you don’t understand the system, you’re stuck playing by someone else’s rules. Econ, Finance, and yes — knowing the basics of crypto — aren’t electives anymore. They’re survival skills.” - The Founder 

Pardon if I’m wasting time for my more experienced readers, but a refresher doesn’t hurt!

👉 And if you want to see how I put this into action — with real positions, diversification strategies, and the macro picture tied together — that’s all in my Founders Portfolio (exclusive to Substack). 😉

China’s international operations centre for the digital yuan opened in Shanghai on Thursday, with the People’s Bank of China highlighting three platforms designed to accelerate the internationalisation of the digital Chinese currency. “The evolution of monetary and payment systems in the digital era is a historical inevitability,” central bank deputy governor Lu Lei told a news conference on Wednesday. “The PBOC is committed to providing open, inclusive and innovative solutions to improve the global cross-border payment system.”

One of the three platforms is a cross-border digital payment platform that will explore the use of the central bank-backed digital currency – also known as e-CNY – to improve the efficiency of international transactions. Another is a blockchain service platform that will enable on-chain payments and provide standardised cross-chain transaction information transfers, and the third is a digital asset platform that will help existing financial infrastructure expand onto the blockchain by providing standardised, ready-to-use digital asset services.

But amid growing tensions with the United States over trade and technology issues, China has stepped up its push to expand overseas adoption of the yuan and e-CNY and accelerate the rise of Shanghai as a global financial hub to reduce its reliance on a US dollar-dominated financial system. In July, US President Donald Trump signed a law that would allow regulated US banks to issue stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to another asset – backed by the US dollar, a move that many observers say could pave the way for mass-market adoption and extend the currency's dominance into the digital realm.

While Beijing is wary of cryptocurrencies and their related risks, it has embraced the use of blockchain technology for its traceability and transparency, and applied it in the adoption of e-CNY. The PBOC has begun to collaborate with central banks in Hong Kong, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on a cross-border platform for digital currency payments. In a notice issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China on September 13, Beijing encouraged more financial institutions to explore the use of the digital yuan for cross-border payments.",0,0,0,economy,reddit,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3326928/will-chinas-digital-yuan-centre-be-step-forward-internationalisation,new,Unknown,0.5

***Photo above*** *- recent conclave of RUSSIAN generals. They apparently have more medals than their Pentagon counterparts, but worse dental coverage. Stay away from those hotel windows, guys . . .*

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned 800 generals admirals to Virginia for an impromptu meeting. I don’t know if 800 is “all of them”, but it’s a lot. I’ve been asking the government to consider closing or merging some of America’s 800 military bases worldwide. Now it appears that we have more than 1 general per base.

I was certain this was the most generals ever, but Google says there were 1,500 during World War 2. Google can’t tell for sure, however, because of promotions, demotions, retirements, and MIA. But that was wartime. Are we officially at war with anyone right now? Other than Washington DC and Los Angeles, mean. Is there a national guard general in DC overseeing the troops collecting trash there?

Each general travelling to Virginia will be accompanied by at least 1 senior advisor and several more aides. The total number of guests could exceed 3,000 . . . easily.

Defense Secretary Hegseth is no stranger to military service himself. He was (for approximately 11 months) a national guard reservist tasked with overseeing the care and feeding of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. So this has GOTTA be the thrill of a lifetime for him to summon and browbeat all the guys who were ever above him in the chain of command. If he has time, Hegseth should also take the wheel of an Abrams tank or Humvee, just for the fun of it.

Rumors are rampant that Hegseth plans to fire (or offer early retirement) to at least 100 generals. But we would still have at least 700 on standby, so I don’t think this materially weakens America’s security. In fact, knowing how the military works, I bet that about 30 seconds after those generals start packing their footlockers, a bunch of colonels start getting promoted to general, and majors get bumped up to colonel, etc. If you don’t think this will happen, you are invited to explain your reasoning.

Another line of speculation is that Hegseth is going to order the generals, admirals, commodores, and whatever to root out all the troops in their command who made disparaging social media posts about Charlie Kirk. Or give everyone a giant pay raise. Or prepare for World War 3. You can’t rule ANYTHING out.

The average General and Admiral earns about $220,000 a year. So if 100 of them do take early retirement, the savings will only be $22 million a year. Chump change. Except that they will all get military retirement pensions (as they should), so the actual savings will be quite a bit smaller.

But the optics of this are going to be great. *“Hey folks, I just fired 100 generals. But don’t worry, we still have at least 3 secret bases in Mogadishu Somalia nobody even knows about, so we’re safer than ever. Ignore the state sponsored hacking which is disabling our airports and commercial flights”.*

  
I'm just sayin' . . .

1nqyhs3,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 07:09:51,Starbucks is closing hundreds of stores and laying off 900 workers what’s going on?,"Starbucks just announced a massive restructuring plan that’s going to shake up how (and where) you get your lattes.

☕ The short version

Hundreds of stores are closing in the U.S. and Canada (and some in Europe).

About 900 corporate/support staff are being laid off.

Starbucks is taking a $1 billion hit in restructuring costs mostly from severance, lease exits, and shutting down underperforming stores.

Same-store sales in the U.S. have fallen for six straight quarters.

Why is Starbucks doing this?

Money talks: A lot of stores just aren’t pulling in enough to cover high rent, labor, and operating costs.

Changing habits: Customers are feeling inflation and cutting back on $6 coffees. Home-brewing setups and local cafés are eating into Starbucks’ dominance.

Strategy shift: CEO Brian Niccol says the company wants to get back to basics. That means fewer but better stores  over 1,000 are getting facelifts ( uplifts ) in the next year.

Reshuffling resources: Closing weaker locations frees up cash to invest in stronger ones.

But here’s the messy part

Workers are caught in the middle. Starbucks says baristas at closing stores can transfer, but critics argue many will end up jobless.

Unions are watching closely. Starbucks has been fighting unionization efforts, and some are accusing the company of using closures to target organized stores (something Starbucks denies).

Reputation risk: Starbucks built its brand on being everywhere. Cutting hundreds of stores risks making it less convenient which could push people to competitors.

Big picture

This isn’t just about coffee. It’s about how big chains handle inflation, high overhead, and changing consumer habits. Starbucks is betting that fewer stores + remodeled locations = higher profits. But with $1B in restructuring costs and rising competition, it’s a risky gamble.

If the turnaround works, Starbucks could reinvent itself. If not, your neighborhood green siren might not be around much longer.

1nqws6z,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 05:26:57,i got a question about energy backed currency,"first i see that a lot of people take energy as a ""stock"" from my research but its not energy comes and goes what you should mesure is how much a country is producing per hour hense the name of energy WH so like 0.01$=1kwh produced.

so from what i see it would link your currency to how much actual product your country is producing instead of speculations and such if you have 100 factories,1000homes and 300buisnesses in a country you can predict the value of a currency since it mirrors the economic stability of a country and

an energy backed currency would actualy make corruption harder since 1kwh=1kwh even in the 4th dimension or inside a black hole its physics you cant just lie and tell someone i got 16 terrawatt/h produced if you lie then the engineers wont have data to regulate the energy production to consumption and the grid will burn

and for the people saying if the grid fails i mean if the grid fails in the modern age you got much much much bigger problems to think about a money wont worth anything if nobody can go work

and it would force the goverment to diversify their energy production to make the currency more stable wich in turn is good for the enviroment

and for inequality between countries i mean we already have that tbh but rn if a currency is already stronger and more stable than other currencies he is the king of the hill and no one can take it from him but if it was an energy backed system small countries will have a chance to compete and have a much more stable currency than other countries

and the value of goods and services will increase with the amount of currency since you need energy to produce any other value

so yeah ik that there are some other problems but we have those same problems here and ik that there has to be smth that makes it not even thought about other than resistence from the elites since this removes TON of power from the elite and gives it to the nature of economics ps(i am by no mean an economist i am just an engineering student lol)",0,0,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nqws6z/i_got_a_question_about_energy_backed_currency/,new,Unknown,0.5

1nqvv72,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 04:26:41,Like it's year 1670 again,"# When We Say ""Economy,"" Do We Mean ""Gentry""?

# How Neutral Language Masks Concentrated Power

When politicians promise to ""help the economy"" or economists discuss ""market forces,"" the language sounds universal and democratic. But beneath these neutral terms lies a more uncomfortable reality: what we call ""the economy"" is largely controlled by a small class of owners who bear striking resemblance to the historical gentry.

# The Numbers

The concentration of economic power in modern America is staggering. As of 2023, the top 1% of American households owned 30 cents of every dollar, while in the first quarter of 2024, almost two-thirds percent of the total wealth in the United States was owned by the top 10 percent of earners. Meanwhile, the lowest 50 percent of earners only owned 2.5 percent of the total wealth.

But when we look specifically at productive capital ownership of businesses, stocks, and income-generating real estate, the concentration becomes even more extreme. The richest 1 percent own 50 percent of U.S. stock and mutual funds, up from 40 percent in 2002, according to Federal Reserve data. In fact, a record 93% of stock wealth is owned by the richest 10%, the Federal Reserve has found.

This isn't just about having money. It's about owning the systems that generate wealth: the factories, the algorithms, the distribution networks, the platforms where others work. A relatively small number of people own the means by which everyone else makes a living.

# The New Gentry Class

This ownership class functions remarkably like the historical gentry. Both derive their power and income primarily from ownership rather than labor. Both often inherit their advantages across generations. Both wield disproportionate political influence that flows directly from their economic position.

The key difference is that today's gentry own shares and intellectual property as well as landed estates. But the fundamental dynamic remains: a small class lives off the returns from assets while the majority work for wages within systems they don't control.

# The Language 

Here's where the euphemism becomes clear. When we hear ""economic growth,"" ""job creators,"" or ""market efficiency,"" these phrases obscure who actually makes the decisions and who benefits most from the outcomes.

""The economy"" sounds like a natural force or a collective endeavor. But in practice, major economic decisions such as where to invest, what to produce, how to organize work, and which communities get resources are made by and for the ownership class.

Consider how different our political discourse would sound if we used more precise language:

* ""Helping the economy"" becomes ""increasing returns to capital owners""
* ""Market forces"" becomes ""decisions by large asset holders""
* ""Economic policy"" becomes ""rules that govern how the ownership class can extract value""

# Beyond the Euphemism

Recognizing this linguistic sleight of hand doesn't require embracing any particular political solution. But it does demand intellectual honesty about how power actually works in our economic system.

When we strip away the neutral terminology, we see that many ""economic"" debates are really debates about class power: Should ownership be more distributed? Should workers have more say in workplace decisions? Should inheritance laws allow wealth concentration across generations?

These are fundamentally political questions about how we want to organize society, not technical questions about optimal resource allocation. The gentry, by whatever name we call them, understand this. Perhaps it's time the rest of us did too.

# The Power of Precise Language

Language shapes how we think about problems and solutions. As long as we discuss ""the economy"" as if it were a weather system rather than a set of human institutions controlled by specific people with specific interests, we'll struggle to have honest conversations about economic power.

The next time someone promises to ""help the economy,"" it's worth asking: whose economy? And who really controls it?

Also USA should not be allowed to engage in economic warfare against its enemies. Iran and Venezuela are sovereign nations. If they are guilty of human rights abuses, so are USA and India. India should be allowed to buy oil from Iran and Venezuela. Also India is offering to buy more fossil fuels from USA. With these concessions USA and India should come to a trade agreement.

1nqied0,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 16:56:19,U.S. Economy Expands Fastest in the G7 — But Not Everyone Feels It,"Per the latest BEA revision reported by The Times (Mehreen Khan, 25 Sep 2025), the U.S. economy grew at an annualized 3.8% in Q2 — the fastest pace in nearly two years and the best among the G7. Consumer spending and private investment were revised higher, and initial jobless claims surprised to the downside. Whatever your politics, that’s real, measurable momentum.

But anyone who works with small producers, family businesses, or outside the big metros also knows: headline growth isn’t evenly experienced. Averages can conceal the fact that some groups are still under pressure (rising input costs, tighter financing, competition with scale players, and household balance-sheet strain).

The lesson from past “cuts-without-growth” experiments (Kansas is the usual case study) isn’t that reform is impossible. It’s that growth engines and governance have to move together. Cutting or subsidizing in a vacuum just shifts the pain around. The way you broaden participation is by pairing macro strength with practical pathways for people to adapt.

What that looks like in the real world:
	•	Business-model change for small players. Instead of endless, blunt subsidies, help farms and small firms modernize: technical assistance, market access, logistics co-ops, and low-interest public loans that crowd in private capital. That’s how you turn resilience into competitiveness.
	•	Smarter trade conditions. Whether via negotiated reciprocity or targeted tariffs, reduce arbitrage that punishes domestic producers while keeping export lanes open. The goal is better terms, not autarky.
	•	Balance-sheet prudence. In a volatile global system, owning hard, liquid hedges (households, institutions, and many central banks outside the U.S. have been net buyers of gold in recent years) can stabilize portfolios. For clarity: the U.S. official gold stock is largely unchanged; the point is risk management at the private/institutional level.
	•	Grow out of deficits. Sustained growth is the most durable way to lower debt-to-GDP. Austerity alone shrinks the tax base; growth plus reform expands it.

The U.S. posting 3.8% while leading the G7 is the good news. The next step is making sure more people can actually plug into that momentum. That’s less about abstract ideology and more about execution: practical finance, market access, and incentives that reward adaptation.

I’ll add a comment with a simple line chart showing the divergence (headline GDP improving vs. stress indicators for small business, farm income, and household debt) — not to dunk on the data, but to keep the discussion honest about who still needs a bridge into the boom.

***Photo above*** *- Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter. Notice the axe - it is NOT one of the 5 proven ways to kill a vampire for sure.*  
  
I have nothing against AI. It’s doing middle school kids' homework in a flash, giving them more time to play Call of Duty: Black Ops. In fact, AI is now designing videogames. The circle is unbroken!  
  
If you don’t play videogames, no need tot fret. AI is also doing the CGI on new TV series like “Star Trek – Strange New Worlds”. And possibly writing the screenplays as well. Which explains why ST-SNW episodes are rehashes of previous Star Trek series. AI just regurgitates what was trained on.  
  
The link below warns that AI is already using as much electricity as New York City and San Diego combined. I don’t really care about New York but I’d like to save San Diego if there’s still time. Maybe there isn’t. The article (Fortune magazine) goes on to theorize that AI will soon account for 10% of all the electricity used in the USA.  
  
If 10% doesn't seem like a lot, imagine the frenzy if someone warned that almond groves in California were using 10% of the state's water supply, or that 10% of the Brazilian rainforest was being clear-cut each year to create cattle pasture. (Both of these are true, apparently).  
  
In a related article (no link today, Google it) tech-boys are celebrating the imminent arrival of “backyard nuclear plants”. Not literally in YOUR back yard, if you own a 2,200 colonial on a quarter acre lot. Probably located in that vacanat lot which was going to become a mini-park with pickleball courts. (Village mayor: *“This should be a no-brainer. Do you want the lights to stay on, or do you want boomers playing pickleball day and night?”*)  
  
Just one problem: the typical US town doesn’t have the expertise to operate a nuclear power plant, even one the size of a shipping container. So they will hire some contractor to run it, like we do with private/for-profit prisons. And when it comes to plant maintenance and the safe storage of nuclear waste, those will be put on hold because the municipal employees’ pension fund is underfunded by a million dollars, and that has to be fixed before the next election, or those workers won’t vote to re-elect incumbent mayor and city council. (*""They saved our pensions!*)  
  
If you think the “deferred nuclear maintenance” thing won’t happen, just look at your own city’s water supply or mass transit. If you live in California, look overhead at the 100-year-old high voltage lines which keep sparking wildfires.  
  
As I noted at the start of today's column , I don’t hate AI. But kids won’t be any worse off if they have to cut and paste a Wikipedia article for their homework, instead of having ChatGPT tell them that Lincoln owned a fence installation business before he became president, freed the slaves, and hunted vampires.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

Barclays analysed 250 operational mines linked to 30 mining clients and around 9,000 power generation facilities from 40 European clients, and found both sectors faced notable earnings declines over five years.
The mining sector was hit harder, with earnings falling by around a quarter, driven largely by transition risks. Power companies saw a smaller impact of about 10%, mainly due to physical risks such as droughts and floods, which are more severe in degraded landscapes.

According to fool49:

Environmental degradation is going to have an impact on the bottom line. Europe must give up its addiction to raw materials and consumption. Transition to a sustainable or circular economy. Slow down or stop destruction of ecosystems and related services and biodiversity. EU talks a big game about protecting the environment. But what is the ground reality?

EU companies need to look after the triple bottom line: people, profit, and planet. EU policy needs to transition to maximizing GDP plus natural capital plus human capital. And tax those companies contributing to destruction of natural or human capital. While also rewarding companies with positive externalities.

Quantitative tightening mostly emptied ON RRP during the 2022-2024 period, as money funds migrated into bills, cushioning risk markets from reserve scarcity. But that cushion is gone! ON RRP usage has dwindled to near zero by late August 2025, so further balance‑sheet runoff now bites directly into bank reserves, the same regime that ended painfully in 2019.

The Fed already slowed QT twice — first in June 2024 and again in April 2025 — precisely to approach the unknown ample‑reserves regime more carefully. With TGA elevated and tax/quarter‑end ahead, marginal dollars will toggle between Treasury’s account and reserves with little buffer.

The implication is a market that becomes very sensitive to the cadence of bill issuance, tax dates and SRF take‑up: when TGA swells or issuance clusters, net liquidity sags and reserve balances tighten; when TGA drains, the relief rallies are sharp.

1npvhry,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 22:43:05,The Lesson of the Efficient Market Hypothesis: “Stock Prices Are Unpredictable”,"The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), first formalized by Eugene Fama in 1970, carries a sobering message for investors: if all publicly available information is already reflected in stock prices, then predicting tomorrow’s price is essentially impossible.

Why “Good News” Doesn’t Guarantee Gains

Markets tend to price in expectations before the news hits the wire. If investors anticipate that a company will post blockbuster earnings tomorrow, the stock price usually rises today—well before the actual announcement. Once the earnings are released, the price adjusts only to whatever new information emerges. That’s why trying to guess where a stock will go next is a fool’s errand. This logic underpins the random walk hypothesis, which argues that stock prices move unpredictably.

Does That Make Stock Analysis Useless?

Not necessarily. EMH suggests that on average, it’s extremely difficult to beat the market, which is why index funds have become the go-to investment vehicle for many. But markets are not perfectly efficient. Behavioral economists, like Nobel laureate Robert Shiller, have shown that fear, greed, and herd behavior create bubbles and crashes that EMH alone cannot explain.

The Buffett Exception

The existence of investors like Warren Buffett raises an uncomfortable question: if markets are truly efficient, how can anyone consistently outperform? Dismissing decades of outperformance as “luck” feels unsatisfying. Buffett himself has admitted, however, that most investors should simply buy low-cost index funds rather than chasing alpha. His success reflects both extraordinary discipline and the fact that markets, while mostly efficient, have pockets of inefficiency.

Where EMH Still Guides Us

Even if the hypothesis is not absolute, its implications matter:

1. Beware of hot tips. If a piece of information is truly valuable, chances are it’s already in the price.

2. Don’t overestimate your edge. For every investor who beats the market, someone else must lag behind—sometimes badly.

3. Stay humble. The stock market thrives on uncertainty, and those who forget that risk becoming the “greater fool.”

In the end, EMH doesn’t mean markets are perfectly rational, but it does remind us that chasing short-term predictions is a losing game. For most people, the smarter path is clear: own the market, stay invested, and avoid the temptation of easy promises.",3,0,0,economy,reddit,https://i.redd.it/r0rcb7gs48rf1.jpeg,new,Unknown,1.0

1npg998,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 12:07:37,Will money collapse forever?,"It comes to a meaning of what is money. Money is a resource of exchange for goods and services. For thousands of years, from the days of Mesopotamia when clay tablets recorded debts of grain and silver, money has acted as both a symbol of trust and a mechanism of coordination. People accepted it not because the coins or notes themselves had value, but because everyone agreed they could be used to obtain something else of value or can be easily tangible.

Fast forward to today, money is mostly digital signals blinking across banking servers, algorithmically traded faster than any human can blink. Yet even in this form, the same principle holds: money is is just data. And today's value has been depended on human scarcity. On the idea that our labor, our time, our knowledge, are limited and must be exchanged.

Here is where the story bends: artificial intelligence is beginning to unravel this foundation. If AI agents can design, produce, negotiate, and distribute with **near-zero** marginal cost, then the scarcity of human effort once the very anchor of money’s meaning is dissolved. Why would anyone pay for something when an AI can produce it endlessly and flawlessly? What would happen if these are powered fully by **renewable energy**? If machines outperform humans in nearly every market, the logic of exchange itself falters.

This does not necessarily mean collapse in the apocalyptic sense, but a metamorphosis. The end of money as we know it may give rise to a new system of ownership: perhaps measured not in dollars or crypto-tokens, but in access, reputation, or even attention. In such a future, the “resource of exchange” might no longer be material at all, but social, cognitive, or experiential.

The paradox is that money has always been both fiction and reality. A fiction because it only works if we believe in it, a reality because that belief has shaped empires, economies, and daily life. The arrival of AI may push us toward a future where we need to invent a new fiction, and probably form a new civilization into another planet. One fit for a world where human labor is not the bottleneck.

The real question isn’t whether money collapses forever, but what replaces it when humans are no longer the engines of value creation? Let's discuss this",0,4,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1npg998/will_money_collapse_forever/,new,Unknown,0.17

***Photo above*** *- China claims it has diverted an entire container ship full of 80 cent jeans to Indonesia, because of Trump's tariffs.*  
  
I don’t recall EVER buying jeans for less than $10. But now China says that its 80 cents (wholesale) jeans are going everywhere EXCEPT the USA. (see link below)  
  
What’s the profit margin on something that only costs 80 cents to make, and retails for $19.99 on Amazon? And more to the point, what are the labor and materials cost that go into a pair of 80 cent jeans? Those workers are being paid so little they probably can’t even afford to look at China’s new bullet trains, let alone take a ride to Kangbashi, that half-built city in the Mongolian desert. (Here’s an idea – can we send our deported migrants Kangbashi, instead of Africa? There are evidently 65 million vacant apartments in China's ghost cities.)  
  
I’m being deluged with iPhone 17 ads. The list price of a Foxconn/China assembled 17 seems no higher than previous iPhone 15 or 16 models. In fact, both Verizon and T-Mobile are giving the new iPhone 17 away for free (see second link below). If they're free, then the USA isn’t collecting any import tariffs on them, right?  
  
Can some historical quotes help us understand today's news? How about “We will bury you!!!” (Nikita Khruschev) or “race to the bottom”?  
  
I honestly believe that a shortage of 80 cent jeans and free iPhones could cause a recession in America. If people aren’t churning their paychecks into disposable fashion and that 3-year-long service contract on a “free” iPhone, then Amazon and Verizon earnings might take a hit. In fact, the whole US stock market may take a hit if there's a recession. Does the phrase “Octoberphobia” ring a bell?  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

1nrsenw,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 07:02:56,US farmers lose $47 billion soybean market overnight. Maybe tariffs aren’t the answer to everything?,"https://preview.redd.it/6tri7v57vorf1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77ab641169e01dbde35b6b584898f86255ccb017

Let’s get caught up to speed, for the benefit of everyone still obsessing over Epstein and Charlie Kirk:  
  
**Trump** (to planet): “You’re all going to pay huge tariffs on everything. I will change the amounts daily. Bwaaaah!!!”  
  
**China** (to US): “Please cancel our US soybean purchases for 2025. We’ll let you know later about 2026”  
  
**Farmers** (to Trump): “We need a $47 billion bailout because now China is buying all its soybeans from Argentina”  
  
**Trump**: “I’m going to bail out Argentina’s economy. Make Argentina Great Again. And here’s a new tariff on kitchen cabinets, in case anyone was thinking of remodeling.”  
  
The silver lining: at least no talking heads will appear on CNN and PBS wringing their hands over soybean inflation in America’s supermarkets. Stop laughing - all of this is true. See link at bottom.  
  
If you had asked me to guess the value of the annual US soybean crop, I’d have said anywhere from $1 billion to $1 trillion. If you asked me how much of America’s farmland is devoted to soybeans, I’d have been equally helpless. Turns out it’s 85 million acres, equal to the combined land mass of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and Delaware. See second link at bottom.  
  
That is a LOT of farmland devoted just to grow soybeans. What does China do with all of these beans? If you said “tofu” (curdled soy milk, congealed to impersonate cheese) you’d be wrong. China mostly feeds our soybeans to their pigs. Which in turn become pork egg rolls, sweet and sour spareribs, and possibly bacon.  
  
I’m okay with this, if it keeps China from harvesting wild bats and selling them alive in “wet markets”, which THEN ends up infecting half the world with the Covid 19 virus. If that’s the way it actually happened, and the pandemic WASN’T a leak from their Wuhan military experimental virus lab . . .  
  
**Let’s cut to the chase.** I wish no misfortune on America’s farmers. But those 85 million acres are probably put to better use feeding America, rather than fattening pigs to feed a global adversary which is constantly hacking America’s airports and banks, threatening to invade Taiwan, and torturing it’s Nobel peace prize winners in prison.  
  
Can we have a conversation about putting America first (not China or Argentina) and keeping our own people fed and housed?  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

When I posted this, I didn’t expect thousands of people to respond. What I read in those comments was sobering:
	•	Young adults aren’t “giving up.” They’re strategic — choosing community college first, skipping degrees that won’t pay off, and avoiding debt they know could crush them for life.
	•	Parents are making heartbreaking choices, guiding their kids through a system that feels like it’s designed to trap, not empower.
	•	People across generations said the same thing: the ladder is broken. College costs are sky-high, wages stagnant, housing out of reach, and debt has become a business model.

This isn’t a “Gen Z problem.” It’s a flashing red light for an economy that no longer works for those starting out.

If a whole generation is opting out, it’s not because they’re lazy — it’s because they’re paying attention. And maybe the rest of us should too.",557,79,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nec35n/gen_z_cashing_out_their_future_isnt_recklessness/,month,Unknown,0.92

1nqyhs3,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 07:09:51,Starbucks is closing hundreds of stores and laying off 900 workers what’s going on?,"Starbucks just announced a massive restructuring plan that’s going to shake up how (and where) you get your lattes.

☕ The short version

Hundreds of stores are closing in the U.S. and Canada (and some in Europe).

About 900 corporate/support staff are being laid off.

Starbucks is taking a $1 billion hit in restructuring costs mostly from severance, lease exits, and shutting down underperforming stores.

Same-store sales in the U.S. have fallen for six straight quarters.

Why is Starbucks doing this?

Money talks: A lot of stores just aren’t pulling in enough to cover high rent, labor, and operating costs.

Changing habits: Customers are feeling inflation and cutting back on $6 coffees. Home-brewing setups and local cafés are eating into Starbucks’ dominance.

Strategy shift: CEO Brian Niccol says the company wants to get back to basics. That means fewer but better stores  over 1,000 are getting facelifts ( uplifts ) in the next year.

Reshuffling resources: Closing weaker locations frees up cash to invest in stronger ones.

But here’s the messy part

Workers are caught in the middle. Starbucks says baristas at closing stores can transfer, but critics argue many will end up jobless.

Unions are watching closely. Starbucks has been fighting unionization efforts, and some are accusing the company of using closures to target organized stores (something Starbucks denies).

Reputation risk: Starbucks built its brand on being everywhere. Cutting hundreds of stores risks making it less convenient which could push people to competitors.

Big picture

This isn’t just about coffee. It’s about how big chains handle inflation, high overhead, and changing consumer habits. Starbucks is betting that fewer stores + remodeled locations = higher profits. But with $1B in restructuring costs and rising competition, it’s a risky gamble.

If the turnaround works, Starbucks could reinvent itself. If not, your neighborhood green siren might not be around much longer.

It is the conceit of billionaires and their sycophants that they and they alone increase the value of a company. How exactly does that happen? Does Elon show up on the factory floor at 4 AM and work his fingers to the bone until midnight? Nope, never happening.  Is he the sole source of every new design or innovation? Nope, that doesn't work out either.

So how does he grow the company to such heights?

Could it possibly be that he uses his influence to get sweetheart, no-bid deals from a corrupt president? Special tax breaks? Subsidies to help ""innovation? All the above?

Ah, that's the key, no doubt.

But where would that massive amount of money ultimately come from? You guessed it: out of the pockets off employees up and down the ladder, and the pockets of taxpayers.

Would he pay income taxes on any of it? Probably not.

But the real question is what would he do with that much money and the power it brings? From past experience, nothing good. What effect would such a pay package have on the packages offered other CEOs? Gotta keep up with the Joneses, right?

To say that this pay package distorts the economy and is dangerous to society is making the remarkable discovery that water is wet. This kind of increasingly dangerous wealth disparity can only lead to the ruin of the nation and the world. It fuels inflation as the ridiculously and dangerously wealthy compete for scarce whatevers, bidding up the prices to show up their competitors on the billionaire class, dragging all other prices up with them. Could that money be better spent? Not a shred of a doubt.

Rent and cost of living issues have caused me to move into my local IKEA. I started by hiding under one of the beds in the apartment living section. I came in 1 hour before closing. I pretended to shop  for an hour with a bag, and then a few minutes before the 30 minute closing warning, I hid under one of the beds. I have my car parked elsewhere away from the storefront as to not arose suspicion. Anyway, I was able to hide under the sheets for the entire night. Before opening, I hid in one of the beautiful full sized cabinets. No one noticed me. I ate breakfast in the Swedish restaurant, and subsequently washed up in the bathrooms in the downstairs corner. I’ve been doing this for about two weeks now, saving a lot in rent in the mean time. However, I’ve had a few close calls. It started when I got addicted to the Swedish meatballs. In short, I got super plugged up, and started farting like crazy. Night time security almost caught me mid fart, so I had to hold a painful gassy one for 30 minutes. Luckily, the guard had fallen asleep in another corner of the store so they didn’t hear me erupt. Does anyone have any suggestions on where else to hide? I think they’re on to me after my farting escapade last Thursday.

1nk98yi,2025-09-18,2025-09-18 10:06:15,I Think We’re Sleepwalking Into a Slow Motion Crash,"Lately I’ve been digging into the numbers behind the headlines, and I’m starting to think the U.S. economy is weaker than it looks on paper. The official unemployment rate is sitting at 4.3%, but payroll growth is basically at stall speed, only 22k jobs in August and averaging 29k over the last three months. On top of that, the BLS quietly admitted payrolls might have been overstated by 911,000 jobs over the past year. If that’s even close to accurate, the “real” unemployment rate could be closer to 4.8%. Layoffs are still relatively low, but people are staying unemployed longer and hiring has slowed to a crawl. This is starting to feel very late cycle.

Meanwhile,  tariffs are set to price in October and November. Companies are freezing hiring and delaying investment because they can’t model costs, which is exactly what Powell called a “curious balance” both labor demand and supply dropping at the same time. Despite that, the Fed just cut rates by 0.25% to 4.00 4.25% and signaled more cuts later this year. They’re clearly trying to cushion the labor market before it tips over, but it’s a risky bet. Rate cuts plus tariffs could re-ignite price pressures even as growth slows.

Inflation’s latest print is 2.9% headline (core 3.1%), and I’m guessing it stays somewhere in the 2.8–3.2% range through fall. The big question is whether weaker demand offsets the tariff driven price bumps or if we’re walking straight into a stagflation lite setup where growth slows but prices stay sticky. This feels like the Fed’s trying to engineer a soft landing with a lot of turbulence still ahead.

**TL;DR:** The labor market’s weaker than the official stats show, tariffs are about to bump prices, and the Fed’s cutting rates anyway. Looks like stagflation lite vibes heading into 2026.",195,79,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nk98yi/i_think_were_sleepwalking_into_a_slow_motion_crash/,month,Unknown,0.92

1nchfd6,2025-09-09,2025-09-09 08:23:19,"The richer you get, the lower taxes you pay","According to phys.org:

For roughly a century, the U.S. tax system has been designed to be progressive, with the wealthiest people paying the highest tax rates. But the fortunes of the wealthiest Americans have been booming in recent decades, and the new research appears to show that when all taxes are combined, the ultra-wealthy pay a lower rate than many people of lesser wealth.

For example: The overall effective tax rate for the top 100 wealthiest in the 2018–2020 period was 22%, but 26.6% for the next 300. The effective tax rate was 45% for top earners who made their income from wages and salaries, as opposed to those whose wealth came from ownership or investment.

According to fool49:

Business taxes have also been cut from 35% to 21%. Why is there no progressive taxation for businesses? Businesses with larger profits should face higher marginal tax rates.

As for taxes on rich individuals, if you compare the tax rates for top workers, it is about double that of top 100 richest, who are mainly owners. Why should workers pay taxes at a higher rate than owners?

I think the maximum tax rate should be about 50%. So rather than lowering tax rates for the highest earning workers, the top richest should see their taxes rise up to a maximum of 50%. Must close loopholes for tax avoidance.

Use the money to lower the annual fiscal deficit.

The Trump administration is drawing up plans to use tariff revenue to fund a programme to support US farmers as they head into harvest facing falling export sales and rising input costs, agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins said...

...The move follows mounting pressure from farm groups after China curbed purchases of new crop US soyabeans and as tariffs have pushed up costs for fertiliser, machinery and other imported inputs. With the soyabean harvest already under way, farmers warn the crisis is deepening.

According to fool49:

Trump will always look after the deplorables, including the uneducated or rural. He has caused a crisis for them due to his trade policies. Fixing them will not make things better, only restore the status quo. I don't think he had fully thought out the consequences of his actions, like implementing tariffs.

The Brazilian farmers are now exporting more soybeans to China, as the Chinese reduce American imports. I am sure they are thankful to Trump.

We're talking about how the economic news matters to regular people: prices, interest rates, saving, and jobs. And we're not afraid to have some fun with it....

In our first episode – Shutdown S\*\*tshow – we discuss how the US shutdown is a symptom of larger fiscal problems that have spread to several major economies. These problems have big implications for future inflation and the value of your savings.

While I explain the macro policy picture, Jason offers an unsentimental perspective from the markets, and Jeremy keeps us both grounded. We're all focused on what the news means to you, not some billionaire planning their next trip to Pluto.

You can find Gross Domestic Provocation on Apple, Spotify, and other major platforms. Links are below. Please share and let us know what you think – feedback, questions, and suggestions are very welcome. We hope you enjoy!

1ny86iw,2025-10-04,2025-10-04 18:58:01,What would happen to Australian savings/investments if the US dollar defaults?,"Good day everyone,

I have a pressing question. With all of the news going around that the US dollar might default with the implementation of a new (digital?) currency, if this were to happen, how would this impact us in Australia? Specifically, how would it impact the value of our dollar and, subsequently, the value of our investments and savings that are based in the Aussie dollar and Aussie market? 

I don't want to live in fear, but I need to plan for a worst-case scenario. I a mostly blind and my mother's caretaker (we moved to Australia a few years ago), so I cannot, like most others in the world, afford to lose all the value of my money as it would devastate our future. I have been diversifying investments into non-Us and non-Aussie etfs, e.g., into European and Asian markets, into gold. But I do have the majority invested in Australia and ones that overlap with the US. So I want to build a long-term strategy that can account for both the best-case and worst-case scenarios.

I am aware that no one knows for certain what will happen, but I believe it is essential that we are cautious and prepared. Any informed insight and advice would be greatly appreocated. 

Thank you. ",1,2,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1ny86iw/what_would_happen_to_australian/,new,Unknown,0.6

The app listens to your voice and gives feedback on confidence, clarity, and tone. You can practice public speaking, mock interviews, or everyday conversation.

It’s been exciting to see people use it in ways I didn’t expect — like practicing pitches, conversations with friends, even dates.

I’m curious what the community thinks:
	•	Would a tool like this feel genuinely useful, or is it just a novelty?
	•	How do you test new apps or tools before fully committing to them?
	•	Any tips for getting honest early feedback from users?

***Photo above*** *– 81 year old Larry Ellison (founder of Oracle) saw his personal fortune soar $100 billion in a single day last month, when he teased that his company might have too many AI orders to fill on time. Accompanying octogenarian Ellison is Irina Osipova, a Ukrainian model who he began dating when she was 19.*  
  
Whenever corporate America decides that enormous scale is their only option, does disaster invariably follow? Was the 2008 housing crash caused by Wall Street and too-big-to fail-banks believing their best idea was jumping into the zero-down mortgages to bad FICO score applicants? Was the [dot.com](http://dot.com) crash caused by everyone believing that everything with “com” in its name was to die for, despite having zero profits? What should we expect next of the 7 AI companies on which much of the stock market value is underpinned?  
  
Do you feel safer, or get more worried, if you hear that the S&P 500 is valued (market cap) at nearly 4 times what the America’s entire GDP is? Should i be more concerned about egg inflation, or stock market inflation?  
  
The normal P/E ratio (price to earnings ratio) for a company’s stock is 10-15. (If you need the price-earnings 101 introductory course, please, google it.). How are the magnificent 7 AI stocks doing on that basis? NVDA is at 50 P/E. It has a market capitalization of $5 Trillion (with a T). Microsoft has a market cap of $4 trillion, and a P/E of 40. Apple also has a market cap of $4 trillion, and P/E of 40. Google (Alphabet) has a market cap of $3 trillion, and P/E of 30 – apparently, they’re a laggard ? Meta, Amazon, Oracle . . . the list goes on. Oracle’s company value rose **$200 billion IN ONE DAY,** and their PE is now 70. The trigger for this explosion? Founder Larry Ellison said they have a backlog of orders.  
  
Remember when [AOL.com](http://AOL.com), Ebay, and Geocities were must-have stocks?  
  
My hope is that all these high-flying AI stocks announce ever more fantastic products/updates. And these products are all excellent, and attract millions of satisfied users. That all the 7 survive, and our retirement accounts are not shot to pieces because we are invested in S&P 500 mutual funds, which is like buying AI as our main investment.  
  
I also had a dream that one day that America would reduce its $37 Trillion national debt, build affordable housing, and return the Social Security Trust fund to solvency. We all have dreams, right?  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

Theory in short: Tie US treasuries to stable coins THEN massively reduce the value of cryptocurrencies through regulation, propaganda, and severing ties to the treasury.

In other words a “rug pull” which is exactly how Russia framed it and it makes perfect sense to me. US debt is greater than 100% of the GDP, when Nixon pulled his stunt, it was only around 30%.

It’s all printed imaginary money propped up by pure faith. The more they print the less valuable our money becomes. The less valuable our money becomes the more we lose faith. So it seems like actions like this WOULD be crucial to sustain the economy. Especially makes sense if they have access to real numbers on job growth and employment while keeping us in the dark so that we will not panic.

I have my car parked elsewhere away from the storefront as to not arose suspicion. Anyway, I was able to hide under the sheets for the entire night. Before opening, I hid in one of the beautiful full sized cabinets. No one noticed me. I ate breakfast in the Swedish restaurant, and subsequently washed up in the bathrooms in the downstairs corner. I’ve been doing this for about two weeks now, saving a lot in rent in the mean time. However, I’ve had a few close calls. It started when I got addicted to the Swedish meatballs. In short, I got super plugged up, and started farting like crazy. Night time security almost caught me mid fart, so I had to hold a painful gassy one for 30 minutes. Luckily, the guard had fallen asleep in another corner of the store so they didn’t hear me erupt. Does anyone have any suggestions on where else to hide? I think they’re on to me after my farting escapade last Thursday.

Because if they had the same amount of children as their parents did, the costs of everything related to childcare (schools, college, medical, women staying at home etc.) would be much higher. Since they were such a large group, the effects of less people entering the workforce could easily be covered with migration.
I‘m a Millenial, my generation has even less kids. But the scheme doesn‘t seem to be working anymore. Would it financially be even possible, that our generation had as many children as required?
I feel like the wealth of the boomer generation and every generation after is more like a loan, we should have invested much more but spent it all on consumer products and cruise ship trips. And now this scheme doesn‘t work anymore, because we have less people entering the workforce but more entering the retiree group. Additionally,  migration with well educated people doesn‘t seem to be working forever.

This is not a rant on boomers, but might it be that this wealth was only possible due to very specific conditions in demographics? ",2,32,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nx4r94/is_the_wealth_of_the_west_based_on_declining/,new,Unknown,0.57

I was curious to know how these festivals impacted the local economy, since music festivals on the whole are struggling to stay in production and, sheeeesh, we are talking $300 million +

***Photo above*** *- Student protestors at the University of California are demanding free tuition. Governor Newsom is threatening to withhold $45 billion in existing funding. Can you predict how this will end?*  
  
**President Trump** \- *“Do as I say, or I’ll cancel your university funding!”*  
  
**Governor Newsom** – “*Me too. I mean, if you do what Trump sez, then I'm gonna cancel the state university funding.”*  
  
This is really happening. See link to San Francisco Chronicle, at bottom  
  
This is a power struggle for sure. Will Trump keep his word, and pursue his anti-woke, anti-antisemitism, anti-illegal alien student agenda?  
  
Or will Newsom get overruled by his state legislature? They might say *“Okay . . . enough with your 2028 campaign posturing. We are so NOT closing down all our colleges and universities. Take a deep breath, okay?“*  
  
This is a battle Newsom might lose. This does not mean I endorse Trump’s university viewpoints. Even if I understood them, and they weren’t changing day by day like tariffs (I just found the Apple iPad Air is exempt from tariffs even though it's assembled in Chengdu China, whose 5 auto plants are buried under those new tariffs).  
  
As far as havens from reality like Harvard and Columbia go, the only thing I’m certain of is that I support jailing or expelling students who attack suspected Jews on campus, or are cancelling classes, or who are trashing buildings. Stick to that one, Mr Trump. I don’t view campus unisex bathrooms for consenting adults as that big a deal. Let the pro-Muslim students explain why they want the kind of restrooms which probably offend Allah, while they're delivering a beat down to some guy wearing yarmulke.  
  
We are in day 3 of the US government shutdown. The stock market is still rockin’ it . . . the DOW is up 300+ points this week. The Nikkei Japan index was up nearly 2% yesterday. The London index (FTSE 100) up nearly 1% as well. None of this means that these places endorse our shutdown, or Trump's policies of course. Just that billionaires don’t believe the rhetoric both sides are spewing.  
  
The US government shutdown, like California college funding, isn’t about balancing budgets. It’s a power struggle to assert dominance of political ideology.  
  
It might be better to stay focused on the economics. Does anybody believe a $37 trillion national debt is sane? How about $45,000 tuition to the University of California? That’s like buying a Tesla Model Y and driving it off a cliff every year, for 4 years.  
  
We can have anything we want in America, as long as we can pay for. We can’t print fake money endlessly for things which most people don't understand or use.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

The big ugly fundamentally altered the priorities of the United States government. It cut about $1tn from healthcare programs, including Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, meaning that health insurance premiums for tens of millions of Americans will soar starting in January.

According to fool49:

It should be not a requirement to have health insurance, as it is now. If people get sick, they should be offered the option of free euthanasia. In India healthcare is corrupt, with false diagnosis, leading to unnecessary treatment and expenses. Furthermore it serves as a front for the authorities and their security services, to detain and torture people.

Yield curve: Historically one of the best predictors. Right now, the 10y–2y spread is positive (~+55bps), so it doesn’t scream “imminent recession.” The NY Fed model pegs 12-month odds around 20–30%.

Labor market: Unemployment has ticked up to ~4.3%, and hiring is slowing, but we’re not in freefall.

Inflation + Fed policy: Inflation is ~2.7–2.9%, and the Fed is shifting toward cuts, which usually reduces recession risk.

Debt + markets: Household debt is at record highs (~$18.4T), corporate leverage is heavy, and equities are at record valuations. This makes the system fragile — a small shock could tip it over.

So depending on which lens you use, you could argue:

Soft landing: <20% chance of recession.

Baseline slowdown: 25–35% chance, mild downturn.

Fragile system / shock-sensitive: >35% chance if leverage meets a trigger event.

My working view: ~30% probability of recession in the next 12 months, ~10–15% chance of a deeper/severe one.

What do you think is the most underappreciated factor in current recession risk? Is the yield curve still trustworthy in the QE/post-COVID era? Or are debt and asset bubbles the real ticking bomb?",0,7,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nwu27h/how_likely_is_a_us_recession_in_the_next_12/,new,Unknown,0.17

1nwt3ga,2025-10-03,2025-10-03 04:03:08,"NASA can be competitive with private companies, especially for more complex and scientifically innovative projects","According to FT:

Industry-built spacecraft were indeed cheaper, but only for lower-risk projects: the so-called Class C and D missions, where the scientific stakes are modest and the chance of failure is acceptable. Once the analysis moved up to Class A and B missions, the high-profile, flagship science projects where budgets balloon and timelines stretch, the difference evaporated. Nasa and industry came out roughly equal. In some cases, Nasa was cheaper.

According to fool49:

This article challenges the wisdom that private space companies are always overwhelmingly cheaper or more efficient, as compared to NASA. However it does confirm that for the simplest spacecraft private companies are cheaper. For the most complex projects NASA is competitive. You just have to think of all the failures and ballooning costs of Starship. 

And the government is involved even in the private economy. They develop many technologies, which private players get for free. Government agencies provide short to long term contracts and funding for private companies. Long term projects that require high R&D spending, requires parties that have patience and long term capital.

In addition the article explains that most space startups have failed, as most new businesses fail. And that having alternative suppliers of space launch systems, lowers risk and provides redundancy.

What happens next:

Short term: market can stay irrational.

Medium term: earnings collapse as demand dies, stagflation in essentials.

Offshore dollar credit exploded in the 2000s as global banks recycled U.S. deficits into loans abroad, embedding the dollar into every balance sheet from Brazil to Korea.

After the financial crisis, official liquidity backstops kept the system alive, though growth in offshore credit slowed even as the U.S. trade deficit deepened again. The pandemic brought another burst of dollar lending, reflecting both emergency funding and risk‑taking during stimulus, but, since 2022, the expansion has faltered while America’s external deficit has widened to historic extremes.

The divergence tells a structural story in that global demand for dollar funding is no longer scaling at the pace of U.S. external borrowing needs, tightening the hinge that connects Wall Street liquidity to Main Street trade flows.

1nw6e9k,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 11:08:52,Implications of a stock market detached from reality.,"I know that there's been a lot of posts about an overvalued stock market and a ""stock market bubble"" but I'm looking for opinions and serious discussion about what the implications to the economy are and what it actually means for everyday Americans.

My own view is that we are in a bubble, and that things may end badly.

Part 1: Are we in a stock market bubble? Many factors indicate yes.

* [Shiller PE ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe): now at levels only seen once before—the dot-com bubble.
* [Buffett indicator](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp-the-buffett-indicator/) (Market Cap / GDP): soaring past its all-time high.
* Extreme Valuations: e.g Palantir is trading at a 600+ PE ratio.
* Tech has risen nearly 50% since the April lows.

Part 2: What it means

Obviously, a growing stock market is generally a good thing, both for the country, as well as for the individuals invested in it. However, I am increasingly seeing a disconnect between the valuations and the state of the economy

* Job growth is at the lowest level in 15 years and unemployment rate is at the highest this year ([source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jobs-report-today-august-2025-three-takeways-federal-reserve/))
* US Dollar is continuously weakening (and projected to weaken more amidst fed rate cuts)
* Tariffs are at an all time high (maybe related to [0.4% MoM inflation](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/09/11/BLS-Consumer-Price-Index-inflation-joblessness/6251757604128/) in August which is still stick) 
* The government shutdown, and [gdp taking a hit ](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/bessent-shutdown-gdp.html)

Everyone likes seeing their stock portfolio go up, but what does it mean for the US economy if the underlying value is not there? QQQ took over 15 years to rereach its high of $118 after the dot com crash. On the one hand, prices today are this elevated because more Americans are invested in the stock market than ever before (and by a lot). On the other hand, this means that a crash will have the most widespread impact on Americans in history. I think we could be living in an unprecedented time and would like to hear everyone's thoughts on the best case as well as the worst case.

1nw3fqp,2025-10-02,2025-10-02 09:13:38,Poland launches deposit-refund system for drinks bottles and cans,"Poland has today launched a nationwide deposit-refund system for plastic bottles and metal cans, with the aim of ensuring more such packaging is recycled. Glass bottles will also soon be added to the scheme.

The system, similar to others already operating in many European countries, requires consumers to pay a deposit as part of the price when purchasing products in such containers. The deposit is then returned to them when they bring the packaging back to the store or another collection point.



For plastic bottles up to three litres in capacity and metal cans up to one litre, the deposit is 0.5 zloty (€0.12). For reusable glass bottles up to a capacity of 1.5 litres, the deposit will be 1 zloty from January 2026.

Containers covered by the scheme will have a special logo on them saying “kaucja” (meaning “deposit”) and the size of the deposit.

However, the climate and environment ministry notes that drinks with such markings will only appear gradually over the coming months, as producers and stores sell down existing stock and introduce the new packaging. Items without the logo will not be eligible for deposits.



After use, packaging with the deposit logo can be returned to any store over 200m² in size that sells beverages in deposit-refundable packaging; shops smaller than 200m² that sell drinks in reusable glass bottles; or any other stores that choose to join the system.

In stores, deposit returns can be handled either by employees or by automated machines. Meanwhile, there will also be automatic deposit machines placed outside some stores, while each of Poland’s almost 2,500 administrative districts (*gminy*) will have at least one public collection point.

No receipt or other proof of purchase is needed in order to return packaging. However, the climate and environment ministry, which is responsible for the system, emphasises that containers should not be crushed or damaged in any other way before being returned.

It is also possible for individual beverage producers to decide not to participate in the system, and instead to pay a fee themselves directly rather than collecting deposits for their packaging.



“The deposit-refund system is one of the steps that will allow us to achieve important environmental goals,” says deputy climate and environment minister Anita Sowińska. “We all want clean forests and beaches. We want our rivers, lakes and seas not to be filled with tonnes of plastic.”

Plans for the system were first [announced](https://notesfrompoland.com/2021/04/09/polish-government-plans-deposit-system-for-plastic-and-glass-bottles/) in 2021. The following year, the then government said it hoped to [launch the system in 2023](https://notesfrompoland.com/2022/06/03/poland-to-introduce-deposit-system-for-recycling-bottles-and-cans-next-year/). However, the process was subsequently [repeatedly delayed](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/04/11/delay-in-recycling-deposit-system-will-cost-poland-billions-in-eu-charges-warns-industry/) amid political wrangling and industry lobbying.

Now that the system is in place, it is likely to take Poles some time to get used to how it works – and get into the habit of saving and returning their bottles and cans.

An opinion poll by the IBRiS agency published last week by the Polish Press Agency (PAP) found that only 47% of Poles say they understand how the system works. A further quarter said they had heard of the idea but were unfamiliar with the details, while over a quarter had not even heard of it.",1,0,0,economy,reddit,https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/10/01/poland-launches-deposit-refund-system-for-drinks-bottles-and-cans/,new,Unknown,0.67

According to fool49:

OpenAI has overtaken SpaceX to become the most valuable private company in the world. As a kid I was very interested in computers and AI, and space and space travel and exploration. So I am very happy about the recent progress in generative AI, and private space companies. 

But SpaceX is an older and more mature company with 2 to 3 times the sales revenue of OpenAI. OpenAI is a software company, while SpaceX is a space hardware company.

I am not sure, but both have long term objectives. SpaceX: making humans a multi planetary species, including Mars. OpenAI: artificial general or super intelligence, though they may be more focused on incremental innovations like Agentic AI.

***Photo above*** *- During World War 2 cars and trucks were modified to run on coal, as an alternative fuel.*  
  
The docents and dowagers named Ford must be turning over in their graves right now. Ford Motor Company's CEO – Jim Farley - is presiding over a 50% drop in stock price. From $27 in 2022, when he ascended to the corner office, to $12 today. Ford’s 1 year future “target price” as estimated by Wall Street pro's is a further decline to $11.  
  
How could this happen?  
  
Mr. Farley blames “pesky” customers for not flocking to his $100,000 Ford F150 Lightning pickups (platinum trim). If $100K sounds insane, you can get a less heroic trim EV F150 for only $75,000. See link below. Okay, I can see a couple of problems here, Mr. Farley.  
  
First, somebody in accounting may have told you that EV tax rebates continue forever and would rise from $7,500 to $12,000. As long as the assembly line churning them out was staffed by UAW members. Various people in DC were talking this up, as if they could just print money endlessly.  
  
Second, somebody in Ford's sales department may have misplaced a digit, and overestimated the market size for $100,000 pickups. Electric vehicles are a thing with coastal elites. Those locations have the charging infrastructure. Farmers in Kansas? Not so much. If a farmer runs short on electrons, it could be a long way back to barn to plug in.  
  
So Ford is pivoting to hybrids, a decade after Honda and Toyota figured out this was the answer to range anxiety. Apparently, all new Ford, GM and Ram pickups will be hybrids. It’s not certain if they will still be “flex fuel”, and able to run on 85% ethanol. This was one of the byproducts of the 1992 Energy Policy Act. Almost immediately refineries began churning out more than 1 billion gallons of ethanol a year, as a consequence of government handouts to corn farmers. Even though there are actually almost zero filling stations where you can get E85. E85 capability became a feature, not a bug. on new pickup truck window stickers.  
  
As usual, I’m dissatisfied. I don’t want to throw tax money at farmers to produce ethanol instead of food for my dinner table. I don’t want perpetual tax incentives on $100,000 electric pickup trucks simply because someone covets UAW votes. I don’t want to wake up tomorrow and read that someone else has patented a pickup truck that runs on coal, and there’s a tax incentive on THAT now . . .  
  
Mr. Farley, you’re not the first CEO to get bamboozled by congress, your accountants, and your sales department. But Ford stock HAS declined 50% over the past couple of years. And you're almost 65 years old. Maybe this would be a good time to start retirement planning?  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

However with the new GST tax regime, luxury watches may face a high sales tax of 40% - but lower tariffs.

The Indians are allies of USA, as they share common values and interests, and a common enemy in China. So while things may look bad in the short term and in the press, eventually they will reach a mutually beneficial trade agreement. 

And EU will not want to be left behind, so they have been negotiating for about 18 years - let us hope that the EFTA agreement incentivises the EU to complete a trade agreement with India.

If companies are going to bring in talent from abroad, they'll make sure to pick the best of the best, but we’re missing the bigger picture: **we’re regulating the people who come here to work, while completely ignoring the massive amount of software development that’s being outsourced overseas.**

While we’re focused on regulating visa salaries, offshore labor now makes up nearly half of all software development in mid-to-large U.S. tech companies. **That’s millions of IT jobs and billions of dollars flowing out of the country** to India, Latin America, and Eastern Europe, while thousands of U.S. developers are getting laid off. On top of that, it's billions of dollars in lost tax revenue every year, money that is not being collected to fund the needs of the country.

[Average Annual Cost to Hire Offshore Developers \(2025\)](https://preview.redd.it/5fv2av3j1lsf1.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4b95ec30aca542fa05cfd696aa66d1e5b1cbfe9)

So, **why not impose tariffs/taxes on overseas labor**? We already do this with physical goods, **even basic necessities like food** facing tariffs of 20%, 50%, **even more than 100%** depending on origin.

Meanwhile, companies can outsource half their software development to overseas teams with **zero equivalent penalty**. No tariffs. No accountability. Just cheaper labor and bigger margins, while thousands of U.S. developers get laid off.

Look again at that table above and make the math, you pick whatever percentage you think is fair... and just for reference, there is a **250% tariff on Dairy products** (yes, like Milk and Cheese) imported from Canada.

>!My personal take would be to stop treating developers like rock stars and progressively align their salaries with other engineering fields, but at the same time heavily tax offshore labor to make local hiring attractive again. After months of unemployment, I doubt many developers would complain about a more reasonable salary when the alternative is no job at all.!<",0,4,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nvo28i/forget_the_h1b_debate_offshore_labor_is_stomping/,new,Unknown,0.5

1nvlyca,2025-10-01,2025-10-01 18:01:13,The falling foreign share of Treasuries and the Fed’s oscillating dominance show that U.S. debt absorption has moved from global savings toward central bank balance sheet management.,"The split between central bank balance sheet demand and foreign demand is ultimately the fulcrum of the Treasury market. Foreign ownership peaked just after the Great Recession, when recycling of U.S. current‑account deficits through official reserves made Treasuries the global savings sink. That structural bid has eroded as reserve accumulation plateaued, China diversified and oil exporters drew down savings.

The Fed filled the vacuum, first through QE waves that pulled its share to historic highs, then through QT phases that temporarily ceded ground before being forced back in by stress.

The recent picture shows a secular handoff, with the foreign share grinding lower while the Fed’s share oscillates around policy cycles. That means the Treasury market’s marginal buyer is no longer external surplus countries but the central bank managing domestic liquidity and collateral.

This, in turn, ties debt sustainability to policy credibility, makes the system more reflexive and leaves global linkages weaker.

***Photo above*** *- this is NOT the Versailles Palace, built for French King Louis XIV. It's the Pennsylvania capitol building in Harrisburg, where politicians are debating how to balance the state budget. Can you see the forest, guys?*  
  
Wow, for a guy (allegedly) running for president in 2028,, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro seems determined to tank his chances before the first debate even takes place. Because neither the Democrat controlled Pennsylvania state house or Republican controlled state senate can agree on a budget, so Shapiro’s solution is stop showing them relevant expense data. *“Your only job is to pass the budget. Just do it.*” (actual quote - see link below).  
  
I don’t think Shapiro is inspired by Trump here, although there are eerie parallels between the Federal budget (we just started a federal shutdown this morning) and Pennsylvania’s attempt to rein in their own out of control expenses. The highest paid state employee is apparently a guy named “James Grossman” earning $500,000. James flew under the radar until earlier this year. He’s the teachers pension fund administrator, and he earns twice as much as Governor Shapiro, who himself is apparently the highest paid governor in America.  
  
If you think the head teachers' pension fund guy SHOULD be paid a lot, I won’t debate this on Glassdoor metrics. But I will point out that Pencilvania's pension fund has been underfunded for 15 years (obligations far exceed assets) and would have been declared bankrupt if it weren't a government agency. If it were a bank, the FDIC would have closed the doors and liquidated it. Eventually this pension balloon is going to burst, probably requiring a state bailout.  
  
So maybe $500,000 a year to decide to run the pension fund’s $72 billion investment fund is fair. I'd do it for that salary, for sure. And - in the interest of public policy transparency - I would have put the whole shebang in an S&P 500 municipal fund. It would have earned 13.7% compounded return on average every year since 2010. The fund assets would be 600% higher than where they started in 2010. This would be WAAAAY more than Mr. Grossman was getting from the esoteric mix of “fixed income and corporate debt"" holdings being pushed on him by wall street smarties earning sales commissions.  
  
The answer to government budget problems isn’t to declare government salaries off limits for review, or officials’ free cars, or how much it will cost to refurbish the state capitol building in Harrisburg, with its 282 foot, 52 million pound dome. Hiding overspending never works. I really cannot give Shapiro, or Newsom, or AOC, or Pritzker a thumbs up for the 2028 presidential nomination. Just like the current president, they're all instinctive liars and over spenders.  
  
I’m just sayin' . . .

Workday is embedding AI into HR, finance, and analytics – helping businesses cut inefficiencies and make faster decisions.

This AI adoption is being seen as a blueprint for growth in enterprise software.

Early investors who spotted this trend benefited big.

It got me thinking – Workday isn’t alone. Similar companies leveraging cloud + AI (especially in HR tech, fintech, enterprise tools) could be the next breakout stocks.

Toyota and its Japanese peers have been slow to put high-tech EVs similar to those provided by BYD on the market, creating doubts over whether they can ever catch up. Auto industry insiders see a fundamental problem in the development speed for new models, which Masato Shoji, partner at Deloitte Tohmatsu in Tokyo, estimates to be six to seven years for Japan’s car producers compared with 18 months for some Chinese peers...

...""The one concern I have is software and autonomous driving technology,” says Yuzawa, who describes the Japanese groups’ slow progress as a risk rather than an immediate threat.

According to fool49:

Chinese not only have superior technology, they also have a superior much faster product development process. I don't see how Japan can catch up in EVs and SDVs, unless they change their business model. Right now Japan has large protected markets like India, USA, and home. 

But they must not get complacent and only design and build models for such markets, largely protected from Chinese competition. Automotive companies will have to transform, to technology and software companies.

The US government has shut down, after senators fail to agree on a last-minute funding bill - this is how we got here

Earlier, President Donald Trump threatened mass ''irreversible"" firings of federal workers if the shutdown went ahead

During the shutdown, the federal government stops all non-essential functions, while employees whose work is deemed essential, such as active-duty military members and federal law enforcement officers, are required to report to work, often without pay.

According to fool49:

Trump is planning to fire thousands of workers. When the government restarts it may be a lot smaller. And I don't think security workers, or anyone else, should have to work without pay. The last time the government shutdown was also during a Trump administration. I don't know if the democrats are being unreasonable and punishing Trump. 

Let us try an experiment on how the country functions without funding or services. I think we can survive without law enforcement. But how secure is the country without military. They shouldn't work if they are not getting paid. Unless the government makes a commitment to pay them for all their labour during the shutdown, when the government restarts.

***Photo above*** *- America's largest surviving coal fired power plant, near Macon Georgia. See the intense orange flames, proving those are NOT nuclear cooling towers? The plant uses 11 million tons of coal annually, all brought by train from Wyoming. That's 1 million railroad cars, if you're keeping count . . .*  
  
I haven’t seen a coal fired electric plant in years. The closest one to me is about an hour south, near Gibsonville Florida, off route 41. Never been there. America has been phasing coal plants out. President Trump wants to change all that. $600 million in taxpayer money will be used to reopen closed coal fired electric plants (see link below).  
  
If I can oppose government handouts for windmills - and billion dollar fusion reactors which don’t actually generate power – I can rant against handouts for coal strip mines and power plants too. More coal is the answer to a question nobody ever asked, except possibly miners in West Virginia and Wyoming.  
  
I’m all for more electricity. During a watch party for the Buccaneers game Sunday we were bombarded with several “AWS” ads – Amazon Web Services. Between AWS and Amazon’s half dozen AI projects there is a LOT of electrical consumption. Jeff Bezos refuses to disclose how much electricity his empire uses, but I’m going to guess it’s considerably more than what could be generated by $600 million worth of remodeled coal plants.  
  
The problem isn’t coal. Or AI, or server farms in general. Or nuclear power plants nearing the end of their useful lives. Or windmills which need to be torn down and thrown into the sea to become artificial reefs after their 25 year life expectancy is reached. Or dams which block rivers and prevent fish from spawning. The problem is that we – as consumers – always insist on more and more electrically powered conveniences, and the cheapest possible KwH cost to run these things.  
  
Remember when we were brainwashed that LED lights were so efficient that they were going to save us from needing new power plants? Government mandates forbade the construction of new homes with incandescent bulbs, and soon they were no longer even for sale at Home Depot. A single 60 watt (equivalent) LED replacement cost $9.99 back then. Hooray, we will earn back the purchase cost over 25 years if we use that bulb 2 hours a day.  
  
Today those same bulbs are available (from Amazon) for 90 cents each. Down from $9.99 each during the heady government mandate+stop climate change era. I possibly still have some of those $9.99 legacy LED bulbs in some of my lamps. And CFC twist bulbs, too.  
  
Government mandates and giveaways distort markets. Just like the cost of LED bulbs first went over the moon, then eventually came back to earth. Now those refurbished coal plants are going to make someone rich. Our government is picking winners and losers. Someone with a stake in coal has just become a winner, and someone with a stake in wind turbines was a loser earlier this year.  
  
  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

1nub7yy,2025-09-30,2025-09-30 07:59:27,A widening U-6 minus U-3 alongside falling quits shows worker option value fading and wage pressure cooling even as headline unemployment stays tame.,"The gap between U-6 and U-3 unemployment rates fattens when hours are cut, part-timers can’t get full-time work and discouraged workers drift to the sidelines. Quits are the mirror image of that under the skin of the labor market, rising only when workers have credible outside options.

When you put the spread and quits together, you get a clear signal of bargaining power moving through the cycle. The 2002–2007 upswing, for example, narrowed the spread without ever producing an explosive quits impulse, which is why wage growth never truly broke out.

Since the 2022 spike in quits — at which point marked peak worker leverage — the re-balancing has been textbook, with the U-6/U-3 spread drifting wider while quits have slipped toward their pre-2018 range, telling you that the jobs market still creates positions but with thinner option value for workers and a quieter wage-pressure channel.

A wider slack spread with subdued quits implies wage inflation cools even without a hard break in payrolls, which preserves room for disinflation to continue while keeping measured unemployment deceptively calm.",2,0,0,economy,reddit,https://i.redd.it/65cinb3mkasf1.jpeg,new,Unknown,0.75

1nu1q99,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 22:42:52,China official manufacturing PMI shrinks in Sept; Private PMIs positive.,"Chinese manufacturing activity shrank for a sixth consecutive month in September, official purchasing managers index data showed on Tuesday, while service sector activity also weakened. 

But a separate, private PMI survey showed both manufacturing and services activity growing much more than expected in September. 

Manufacturing PMI read 49.8 in September, government data showed. The print was slightly stronger than expectations of 49.6 and the prior month’s reading of 49.4. 

A reading below 50 indicates contraction, with China’s manufacturing sector having shrunk consistently since April this year. 

But private PMI data presented a different picture. The RatingDog China manufacturing PMI grew to 51.2 in September, more than expectations of 50.2 and above last month’s reading of 50.5. 

The print showed manufacturing growth at its strongest level in six months, and reflected a much sharper increase in exports than seen in the government data. 

The RatingDog PMI, formerly the Caixin PMI, differs from the government reading-- while the government print focuses more on bigger, state-run enterprises in the north, the private data covers smaller private enterprises in the south. 

Investors usually use both PMIs to gain a broader picture of the Chinese economy. 

While Tuesday’s readings did show some improvement in September, it still pointed to the manufacturing sector remaining largely under pressure from soft overseas demand, especially in the United States.",3,1,0,economy,reddit,https://uk.investing.com/news/economy-news/china-manufacturing-pmi-shrinks-for-sixth-consecutive-month-in-september-4284291,new,Unknown,1.0

The tariffs are set to apply from Oct. 14, with some increases targeted to take effect Jan. 1, according to a proclamation signed Monday. They follow a Commerce Department investigation into imports of lumber, timber and derivative projects that was launched in March.

Trump said the planned actions will “strengthen supply chains, bolster industrial resilience, create high-quality jobs and increase domestic capacity utilization for wood products.”

Yet home builders have warned they also could deter investments in new houses and renovations. That could blunt the effectiveness of Trump’s high-profile campaign to boost homebuying by encouraging the Fed to lower interest rates.

Canada stands to be hit hard by the order, as it’s by far the US’s largest wood supplier and it’s already subject to 35.2% duties meant to counter alleged subsidies and unfair pricing.

1nu0jsv,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 21:47:29,Shutdown Showdown,"This week will test the market’s ability to separate politics from fundamentals. The immediate driver is the September jobs report, which the Labor Department has warned will be suspended if a government shutdown begins on October 1. That puts traders in a unique bind; markets are forced to hedge not only against the jobs number itself, but also the possibility of no release at all. Historically, shutdowns lasting less than a week create modest equity drawdowns (−1% to −2%), while volatility (VIX) spikes +10–20% before fading once a deal emerges. With Trump openly signaling that Democrats will take the blame, and with both sides entrenched, the odds favor at least a short shutdown of 5–7 days.

For the S&P 500, this suggests a choppy, defensive week with a likely range of −2% to +1%, as investors await political clarity. The Nasdaq may hold up somewhat better, as any softer jobs tone or delay will ease pressure on yields; however, it will remain vulnerable to intraday swings, trading within a −2.5% to +1.5% band. The VIX will be the most telling instrument, expect an initial 8–15% surge early in the week, with the potential for another spike if a shutdown drags past October 3–4, followed by sharp mean reversion if a stopgap deal is reached by the weekend or early next week.

The broader takeaway: volatility is the trade, politics are the driver, and equities will only find footing once Trump can secure a symbolic “win” at home and allow negotiations to resolve.

**TLDR:** This week leans volatile and defensive — S&P 500 and Nasdaq will chop lower, while the VIX surges early before fading if a short shutdown is resolved by October 7–10.",2,6,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nu0jsv/shutdown_showdown/,new,Unknown,0.67

1ntjdwv,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 10:23:58,How do we deal with weak local government?,"A city government with limited resources has access to a local spring that could provide drinking water to tens of thousands of people at a very low cost. The same spring is also sought by a multinational bottling company with extensive legal teams, lobbyists, and campaign funding. The company is in a far stronger position to secure the rights.

Once the contract has been signed, the spring is effectively transferred from a potential public utility to a private input for global distribution. The city remains responsible for infrastructure such as roads, policing, and drought management, but no longer controls the water itself. Small municipalities rarely have the legal expertise or political leverage to demand high fees that reflect full costs.

A single truck driving the bottled water away already has an impact. Engineers measure this with the “equivalent single axle load” (ESAL). A single 80,000-pound semi can cause road damage equivalent to thousands of passenger cars. Now imagine dozens or hundreds of trucks. Even though the company is providing jobs which pay wages. The citizens earning those wages still have to go through local government. Meanwhile the local government won't even earn enough money to fix the roads. 

Citizens can then pay a ~200,000% mark-up to buy a bottle of water, while their roads turn to shit. How do we solve this issue while ""keeping government small"" ? Who is supposed to stand up in favor of the public good? In every single arena where the citizen can demand change, the company has more power. In the courts, in the chambers of power, in the newspapers. Hell, in the next election cycle, the politicians will brag about bringing new jobs to the area. They might even be rewarded for it, while they will now be subsidizing a billion dollar company.

USA has forgotten who its friends are. Apple has shifted much iphone production to India.

So trade numbers don't give an accurate picture. One should look at value added. Tarrifs on particular countries will not necessarily result in reshoring, it could result in a shift of manufacturing from high tarrifs countries to low tarrifs countries.

1ntg6xz,2025-09-29,2025-09-29 08:05:51,This ratio shows which scarcity is in charge — financial hedging (gold) or physical barrels (oil).,"The crude oil-in-gold ratio is a purity test for scarcity, as it strips out the dollar and tells you whether the market is paying a security premium for financial hedges or a barrel premium for physical tightness.

When one ounce buys many barrels, the bid is in gold (that is, macro hedging, duration fear and liquidity demand), as the chart clearly illustrates, while upstream capacity and efficiency keep oil from commanding scarcity rents.

If, however, one ounce buys fewer barrels, energy tightness is doing the talking and inflation risk is coming from the pump rather than the “printing press.”

As of July 2025, one ounce of gold could buy 48.3 barrels of crude oil. That’s quite elevated, though it pales in comparison to the pandemic-induced 80 mark recorded five years ago.

This ratio outperforms narratives because it forces you to pick which scarcity the market is actually pricing.

Read it as a regime gauge: high barrels-per-ounce says financial anxiety is outrunning physical shortage; low barrels-per-ounce says the constraint is real-world molecules and logistics.

***Photo above*** *- The Simpsons, Season 7, Episode 7. Homer demonstrates a variety of techniques to feign productivity while working from home.*  
  
Let me admit – right from the start – that I don’t expect the mass firings (if they even happen) to make the tiniest dent in the national debt. It will be like a rounding error (less than 0.01%). So why are we even paying any attention to this, if it serves no greater purpose? Americans of all kinds – government workers, the homeless, substance addicts, teachers, first responders, voters in general – we are ALL just bargaining chips to career politicians who are scrambling to get re-elected again and again.  
  
But *“thousands of federal workers are terrified”* that they might lose their jobs. (see link below). Nobody is terrified that housing might become LESS affordable as the national debt soars, or that colleges continue to churn out students with irrelevant degrees who are functionally illiterate. Probably a few people are worried that defunding the police (and FBI, and ICE and homeland security) is going to result in more random shootings. Probably a few people are hoping this happens, as a way to get elected to a vulnerable senate seat.  
  
Let’s focus on the practical aspects of mass government firings, instead of the metaphysical ones. Imagine you were in charge of making a “short list” of people to be fired. (Full disclosure – I have been asked to help with this question a few times in the corporate world). Here are my recommendations, based on experience.  
  
1 – **First in line – anyone with excessive absenteeism and no bonafide medical situation.** This is probably the single biggest tranche of headcount that could be cut at every government level. Most federal, state, and local workers behave like they cannot be fired unless they commit a felony. Absenteeism, insubordination, and petty theft are off the menu as disciplinary triggers. Let’s start with these smirking wisenheimers.  
  
2 – **Those defying repeated “back to the office” mandates**. This applies equally to government and private sector workers. Especially if they have skills which mesh nicely with side hustles: coders, supply chain managers, attorneys, property management, accounting . . . it’s unbelievable how much time these people spend on their second laptop generating their second income, while clocked in. It is important to keep both laptops side by side so you can respond to work emails/texts, attend zoom meetings, etc. and convince everyone that are on the job.  
  
3 – **Vacant positions**. Most people have no idea how lucrative this target is for savings. Any position which has been vacant for longer than 90 days should be eliminated. If you don’t do this, the manager protecting that vacant position will sooner or later fritter it away by hiring a friend, relative, or relative of his/her superiors in the chain of the command. That is the reason that cube is vacant in the first place. The incumbent didn’t do anything vital, and neither will the successor.  
  
4 – **Anything the private sector does with a larger workforce, and for less money.** This is a mind boggling array of jobs. Federal gas stations and attendants for government issued vehicles. Janitorial and trash removal services. Couriers for non-top-secret documents and package delivery. Systems/web management. If you balk at this last one, ask yourself why government agencies get hacked MUCH MORE often than the private sector databases. The difference is that the government doesn’t tell us about those events, because they’re not required to. My mom's local library was hacked and held up for $1 million ransom. The administrators tried to keep it a secret. (Resolution - no ransom was paid and the files were rebuilt over 90 days by the same ""experts"" who allowed the intrusion in the first place)  
  
Okay, if your job appears as part of any of the above items, you probably should be “terrified”, as the article frets. But in reality, don’t worry. There won’t be any mass terminations. Both sides will strike a deal this week, because this is all a kabuki play, and the end game is public perceptions and votes.  
  
Remember, we are all just pawns.

World models are trained using data streams of real or simulated environments. They are viewed as an important step in pushing forward progress in self-driving cars, robotics and so-called AI agents, but require a huge amount of data and computing power to train and are considered an unsolved technical challenge.

According to fool49:

We are reaching the limits of generative AI and LLMs. As LLMs are trained on most data publicly available. To have a better understanding of the world, AI models need to be trained on multi modal data. World models are the next step in AI. But I didn't read any mention of embodied intelligence. That is when AI is placed in like a robot where the intelligence interacts with a physical environment. With the intelligence including world models.

I think a combination of multi modal generative AI with world models embodied in a robot is the next step. But robots can be very expensive with limited mobility and dexterity, and inability to adapt to unstructured environments. Computing has been coming down in costs while increasing in power following Moores law; data, bandwith, processing power all have been growing exponentially. While progress in robots is much slower, we can only hope that simple humanoid robots become cheap, with mass production, and adoption in homes and businesses. Accelerating progress in intelligent machines.

If the deplorables who fear intelligent machines, don't adopt them, then the lead will be taken by countries more welcoming. Especially in Asian countries like Japan, and China. The Luddites will hold back technological and economic progress with their unreasonable fear of machines.

P.S. Everytime I discuss AI, I get downvoted, so I know most participants in this forum, are biased against AI; I hope AIs take your jobs, and those who are more welcome to AIs prosper.

Australia’s ASX 200 index rose 0.8% with focus chiefly on the conclusion of a two-day Reserve Bank of Australia meeting on Tuesday. Banks and gold stocks were the main boosts to the index. 

The RBA is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged amid recent signs of inflation turning sticky, but could offer up some signals on a potential cut in November. 

“A 25bp cut is more likely in November, taking the policy rate to 3.35% for an extended period,” ANZ analysts said in a recent note, adding that Governor Michele Bullock was widely expected to reiterate the central bank’s data-driven stance on further easing, after about 75 bps of cuts so far in 2025.

And China increasing loans and trade with poorer countries. The US bloc is about 2/3 of global GDP and includes most of the richest and technologically advanced economies. The China bloc is smaller, and includes many authoritarian and poor countries, including countries rich in commodities.

Where does this leave India? The quick answer will be to remain neutral as it did during the cold war. But India can benefit from an alignment with USA. Even as it will become the third largest economy within a decade. It is not interested in projecting power abroad, or leading a bloc of countries. India has a large trade deficit with China, and a small trade surplus with USA. Best is if India remains neutral, but if forced to choose, it would prefer the USA along with EU. For flow of knowledge, goods, capital, and people. And because India shares values and interests with USA.

1nsx98h,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 15:29:13,🚀 Wall Street Radar: Stocks to Watch Next Week - vol 57,"**Weeks That Take Skin**

It was the kind of week that makes you talk to screens. Not prayers, bargains.

We spent most of it hunched over prices like mechanics over a stubborn engine, day‑trading a couple of names just to drag Friday into the green by its collar. Nothing humiliates quite like survival mode. You’re not building, you’re just bailing.

Trust? Thin. We don’t trust this market, and the market knows it.

Full article and watchlist [HERE](https://www.gb.capital/p/wall-street-radar-stocks-to-watch-vol-57)

We’re moving super cautiously, the way you walk across black ice pretending you’re not. Our job is simple and ugly: participate until the gauges light up red, and then breathe, regroup, sharpen. Not before. Not after. When Energy and Utilities are wearing the relative‑strength crown, you don’t whine that the party feels off; you pat your pockets, keep your shoes on, and stay near the door.

The portfolio shifted hard. We raised both **CRWV** and **ENPH** to break‑even stops and got tossed. Right call. They’d been loitering, doing nothing but charging rent on our attention. No harm, no shame. The best trades make you feel clever; the right trades often make you feel nothing.

**ATAI** gave us a head rush: up more than 35% in a blink. We sold 30% into strength like adults and welded the stop to break even. Maybe it holds, maybe it doesn’t. The company’s interesting, the tape says biotech’s one of the few industries not lying to itself. Hope is not a thesis. A stop is.

**OKLO**: We sang our last note on Friday. Seventy‑five percent in short order. You don’t complain about a win like that. You log it, nod once, and refuse the victory lap. Recent best, yes. Proof of immortality, no.

Then there’s **CROX**. Friday’s HeyDude x Sydney Sweeney splash hit, and we slid in, not because celebrity endorsements save souls, but because the risk/reward answered without stuttering. Solid company, heavy shelf of support at 74–75, a clean break of the recent daily downtrend, and volume almost doubled. We took it with a wide stop and a smaller size; this isn’t a two‑day fling if it’s going to matter.

**LTRX** is the bruise you keep pressing. We bought the breakout that never arrived. The stock’s pacing a channel like a caged cat; our thesis dies if it slips the lower rail, and we’re already hearing the lock rattle. We gave it room on purpose, not out of mercy. The room is expensive. So is denial.

Macro mood music: VIX down, T2118 down, T2108 ticking up. The market’s bouncing. In two weeks, we’ll learn if this is a dead‑cat hop into a lower high or the coiling that slings us to fresh records.

Feels fifty‑fifty: an honest coin flip, the most dangerous odds in trading because they whisper that you’re supposed to guess. We won’t. We’ll react.

That’s the whole blueprint, unromantic and true:

* Respect the drift even when it insults you.
* Sell into strength because gravity is patient.
* Put the stop where your thesis ends, not where your feelings begin.
* Trade what’s in front of you, not the story you wanted.

We’ll show up again on Monday with knuckles uncurled and rules intact. If the bounce grows teeth, we’ll feed it. If it rolls under and shows belly, we’ll cut the risk and let it play dead without us.

Either way, no speeches, no hero shots. Just the work, done tight, while the market decides whether this was the week it took skin or the week it taught us how to keep it.",1,0,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nsx98h/wall_street_radar_stocks_to_watch_next_week_vol_57/,new,Unknown,0.67

1nstyj7,2025-09-28,2025-09-28 13:20:03,"Citizens’ budgets are quietly transforming Poland’s cities, towns and villages – and leading the way in Europe","**By Callum MacRae**

Wisława Szymborska Park in Kraków opened just two years ago, but Cracovians have already come to know and love it as a precious area of public green space right at the heart of the city.

And it is Cracovians themselves who are responsible for the creation of the park, which was funded through a so-called “citizens’ budget”, under which residents can propose, discuss and vote on projects to be implemented using municipal funds.

Poland has become a global leader in this kind of participatory budgeting. Today, more than 50% of such schemes in Europe are found in Poland, where participatory budgeting is now mandated by law for every major city and has also been adopted voluntarily in many smaller municipalities.

The result has been the beginnings of a minor revolution in local governance, with the steady spread of citizens’ budgets quietly remaking villages, towns and cities.

# The roots of citizens’ budgets in Poland

Poland’s experiment with participatory budgets began in 2009 with the Solecki Fund. While such schemes are most often conceived in the urban context, the Solecki Fund was targeted at small rural administrative units (in Polish: *sołectwa*), allowing them to request that a portion of the local budget be allocated to participatory budgeting.

The programme saw [considerable success in its initial years](http://funduszesoleckie.pl/index.html@p=457.html) (almost half of those eligible made use of the scheme in its first year), and continues to shape local governance in rural Poland, with [around two thirds](https://www.gwsh.pl/content/biblioteka/org/zeszyty/ag/zn20/ZN20AG_11Wojewodzic.pdf#:~:text=Field%20research%20conducted%20in%202023%20and%202024,of%20life%20in%20rural%20and%20urban%20areas.) of the country’s almost 41,000 *sołectwa* today incorporating some form of participatory budgeting under the Solecki Fund.



With the precedent set at the rural level, participatory budgeting soon spread to urban government after Sopot introduced the first city-level citizens’ budget scheme in 2011.

“Slowly, more cities began implementing it as a form of civic celebration, as councillors in municipal and city councils demanded participatory budgets,” says Jarosław Kempa, an economist at the University of Gdańsk and a member of Sopot city council since the introduction of the original scheme in 2011.

From 2014 to 2019, the number of cities and towns running some form of participatory budget [grew almost tenfold](https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/pp/article/view/46722/38233), from 35 to 320. When in 2019 citizens’ budgets became a statutory obligation for all cities with urban district (*powiat*) status, for most this was a matter of legal frameworks playing catch-up.

The schemes are even popular in towns where the legal requirement does not apply – in 2022, [43.5% of municipalities with a population greater than 5,000](https://obserwatorium.miasta.pl/biblioteka/barometr-budzetu-obywatelskiego-edycja-2022/) implemented a citizens’ budget.

# The impact of citizens’ budgets

Across the past 15 years, citizens’ budgets have become a powerful means for local democratic engagement in Poland.

“The initiative to establish a participatory budget in Sopot was an attempt by local government to offer pragmatic dialogue and engage the local community in the decision-making process,” says Artur Roland Kozłowski, a political theorist at WSB Merito University in Gdańsk. As the schemes spread after Sopot’s success, they became “a tool for genuine social activation and inclusion”.

Wisława Szymborska Park is a powerful symbol of the potential of these schemes to transform local economic decision-making.

Until 2019, when the proposal to build the park was submitted, the land on which it now sits was a (poorly kept) car park. The citizens’ budget gave residents of Kraków the opportunity – in a city [plagued by some of the worst air quality levels in Europe](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/12/07/polish-city-records-worlds-second-highest-air-pollution-as-winter-smog-sets-in/) – to consider how else they might like that land to be used.



Moreover, this symbolic power is only heightened by the presence of the former site of Dolne Młyny – once a popular hub for bars, restaurants and exhibition spaces located in a former tobacco factory – which sits across a street to the west of the park.

Despite concerted local opposition, the investors who owned the land on which Dolne Młyny sat [evicted the tenants in 2020](https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/09/18/krakows-post-industrial-nightlife-and-culture-hub-forced-to-close-as-developers-move-in/), with plans to build a luxury apartment and hotel complex that are yet to materialise.

Sitting amid the tranquil trees of the park and gazing across the road, the contrast can feel stark. On one side of the street, citizens have come together to turn a rundown car park into a thriving and much-needed public park.

On the other, the wishes of the local community were circumvented, and a well-loved cultural and entertainment space made way for (yet more) [unaffordable housing](https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/09/02/warsaw-now-more-expensive-than-rome-as-poland-sees-europes-fastest-house-price-rises-in-2024/).



Furthermore, Wisława Szymborska Park is just one of an ever-growing list of participatory budgeting success stories from across Poland: repairs to roads and pavements, new parks, more trees, cycle paths, sporting events and training sessions, public concerts, classes and workshops.

As a resident of Kraków, I frequently make use of citizens’ budget-funded parks, I train and race twice weekly with a citizens’ budget-funded running club, and I witness regular citizens’ budget-funded improvements to basic infrastructure in my local neighbourhood.

In 2024, [163 different projects were funded in Kraków](https://budzet.krakow.pl/aktualnosci/288152,1909,komunikat,wyniki_glosowania_2024.html), from an original list of 1,100 proposals, with a total of 46 million zł (€10.8 million) allocated for implementation.

Taken together, such amenities constitute the lived environment that forms the backdrop against which our lives unfold. Through the citizens’ budgets, residents of Poland are increasingly afforded the opportunity to shape this backdrop to better meet their needs and wants.

# Poland is setting the example in Europe

Interest in participatory budgeting has not been confined only to Poland in recent years. But the extent to which these schemes have become a systematised part of local governance marks the country out from its EU neighbours and beyond.

“Probably nowhere else in the world has this idea permeated such a wide cross-section of different communities and types of administration,” explains Kamil Orzechowski, CEO of Mediapark, a company that develops digital platforms to support local governments in collecting citizens’ budget project submissions and conducting votes.

“The idea of participatory budgeting in Poland has gone far beyond the standard approach, from the micro to the macro scale, from small villages and municipalities with a few thousand inhabitants, to towns, cities, and even entire provinces.”



Orzechowski attributes some of this remarkable success to the idiosyncrasies of Poland’s local government structures, particularly a series of reforms in the 1990s which gave municipalities and cities broad powers over their own budgets.

“The participatory budget was therefore not an empty gesture: it gave citizens the opportunity to make real decisions about the distribution of real money,” he says.

But some of the credit must also go to those residents who participate in the schemes, often in impressive numbers.

“The example of Częstochowa, where 800 projects were in 2024 submitted in a town of approximately 200,000 inhabitants, is astonishing,” Orzechowski notes, adding that statistically, that means there was one idea for every 250 inhabitants.

# There is still room for Poland’s citizens’ budgets to expand

Despite these successes, the Polish scheme is not without its limitations. Most obviously, when compared with some participatory budgeting in other countries, Poland’s citizens’ budgets cover a relatively limited amount of local government finance – generally under 2% of the total budget.

Polish law requires a minimum of only 0.5% of the total budget to be allocated, whereas in Brazil – whose Porto Alegre scheme is often credited as the beginning of the modern participatory budget movement – the figure is [typically between 2 and 10%](https://partycypacjaobywatelska.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/faqqpp.pdf), and in some cases even higher.



Moreover, though the extent of their proliferation through Polish society has been impressive, there is still room for more growth. Putting aside larger *powiat* cities, far fewer of Poland’s smaller municipalities (*gminy*) currently implement citizens’ budgets.

“Participatory budgets have been implemented in approximately 13% of *gminy*, or around 320 out of 2,477,” Kozłowski explains. “The need to introduce mandatory participatory budgets in municipalities and cities without *powiat* status should be considered.”

Though these limitations are significant, the existing legal infrastructure creates a national framework for future reforms – so long as the political will exists to implement them. And, as Kozłowski points out, this will depend on who is in government at the national level.

“Increasing the size of participatory budgets requires a stable financial policy from the central government, which was not forthcoming under \[former ruling party\] Law and Justice (PiS),” he says, adding that their “focus on limiting local government funding served to undermine openness to increasing the size” of citizens’ budgets.

# An optimistic vision of Poland’s economic future

As well as providing a clear institutional pathway to extending the policy, the success of existing citizens’ budgets illustrates why more ambitious schemes are worth fighting for.

In Kraków, as one passes the boarded-up development site of Dolne Młyny and enters the peaceful gardens of Wisława Szymborska Park, two different visions of how Poland’s economy might work in the coming decades are offered – one in which unaccountable investors call the shots, and one in which important funding decisions are made directly accountable to local citizens.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) savings and real debt tracked each other in rough proportion, reflecting a system where household thrift and public borrowing were still bound by a common ceiling.

But the divergence started in the 1980s, as deficits compounded without a parallel rise in savings.

And the real break came after 2008: debt issuance outpaced the capacity of the household sector to accumulate real deposits, leaving monetary assets dwarfed by government liabilities.

The pandemic made this imbalance visible in extreme form, as savings briefly surged but were rapidly eroded by inflation while debt continued to march higher.

The result is a system structurally dependent on institutional balance sheets and foreign buyers to absorb public borrowing, with households no longer providing the ballast.

That shift matters for interest rate dynamics, for financial stability and for the sustainability of fiscal dominance: the private cushion has thinned, and with it the margin of safety in the domestic savings base.

***Photo above*** *- local Albuquerque residents break open a few cold ones to celebrate $800 million in tax breaks awarded to a proposed nuclear power plant.*  
  
People in Albuquerque are cheering. Pacific Fusion has selected New Mexico for its $1 billion nuclear fusion plant. New Mexicans aren’t going to see any actual electricity from this new plant, however. It will CONSUME power instead, because this is just an experiment, not a working reactor. See [ABQjournal.com](http://ABQjournal.com) link below.  
  
I had never heard of “Pacific Fusion” before this morning, so I googled them. Wikipedia has never heard of them either. The closest I came to authentic financial data was the link at bottom, to the Financial Post. A year ago Pacific Fusion's first mention was: “unknown startup nabs $900 million from venture capitalists”. They have zero plants until today's announcement. The Albuquerque location will be their first. And New Mexico taxpayers have become venture capital investors to the tune of $800 million.  
  
Although I am clearly ridiculing the use of tax dollars to propel venture capitalists’ schemes, please note that I am NOT dissing fusion power itself. Even though we've had dozens of claims of fusion breakthroughs over the last decade, and so far no device that produces more kilowatts than it consumes. The Albuquerque plant will do exactly the same.  
  
Remember the tickertape parades and popping champagne corks when some college professor announced he had invented “cold fusion”? That sounds significantly safer than the device proposed for Albuquerque, which will operate at 150 million degrees Celsius – hotter than the center of the sun. Has anybody checked out if that will add to global warming? And if a fusion reactor melts like a broken Fukushima or Chernobyl containment vessel, will it ""safely"" sink into the center of the earth, so it doesn’t harm anyone? What happens when a 150-million-degree fireball reaches the center of our planet, which is only 10,000 degrees? That core will be more than 1,000 times hotter than the lava at there. I hope this isn't one of the experiments Pacific Fusion has planned for its new plant.  
  
I am not inherently against fusion experiments, whether cold, or room temperature, or hotter than the sun. I am not against wind turbine farms, solar farms, tidal power, thermal generation from magma fissures, microwave beams pointed at us from orbiting satellites. I just don’t want my tax dollars given to billionaire venture capitalists to make money off these things.  
  
Let the venture capitalists and/or shareholders bear ALL the risk. Unless someone holds a vote and America's Amazon drivers, public school teachers, and soybean farmers sign up to have their tax dollars involved. Don't leave these decisions in the hands of the local mayor and city council. They're simply lawyers and former school board members who can't even keep the water supply running safely.  
  
But I personally won’t be on the hook for a dime this time. Residents of Albuquerque, this one’s totally on you. But consider breaking ground on a new fire department located near this research hotspot. Just in case 150 million degrees has unintended consequences no one anticipated. We’ve never actually been to the core of the sun you know, so whatever's happening there is strictly a matter of conjecture. And ask the people of Fukushima and Chernobyl what happened their mayors invited ""normal"" nuclear reactors to their towns.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

Will machines make humans useless. Despite the claims of leftists, humans aren't equal. Most humans will become dependents relying on the state to feed clothe and house them. However there will be a minority of humans, who create original art, and transform business and society. Will ordinary humans become powerless, will democracy survive?

Perhaps the only way to save humanity, is with machine augmentation and genetic engineering, where they are able to successfully compete with machines and live alongside them.

Pitted against the VCs, the AI models came out on top. For context, top firms broadly get it right one time in 20. But some LLMs did much better. OpenAI’s GPT-5 correctly picked a winner half the time. China’s DeepSeek-V3 beat the lot, able to single out a future success story six times out of 10. It was also able to do so more cheaply than most other models.

According to Fool49:

I don't think generative AI is quite ready to work independently and replace venture capitalists. But certainly give them a run for the money. What worked in the past, won't work in the future.  But I think it can create a shortlist of entrepreneurs to invest in, for review by VCs. And it might make us rethink venture capitalism. Maybe investors, instead of investing only through VCs, can also use generative AI to directly invest in startups and their founders.

At its core, it tells you whether the banking system is functioning as a credit engine or as a distribution channel for government debt.

The fact that the ratio has never regained its early-1970s high is the fact that regulation, capital charges and liquidity rules over the years have tilted balance sheets toward Treasuries, while loan demand is increasingly met outside banks through private credit markets.

The consequence is that fiscal issuance, not private lending, increasingly dominates how banks deploy their balance sheet. Of course, that reshapes the transmission of policy.

However, its proposal has already been met with opposition from a government minister hailing from a different part of the ruling coalition, who says that it is “not the right time yet” to introduce such an obligation.



While in many countries it is standard for restaurants to offer tap water if requested – or sometimes even to simply bring it to tables unrequested – in Poland the practice is rare. Indeed, many people remain suspicious of drinking tap water in general.

On Wednesday, deputy infrastructure minister Przemysław Koperski, who hails from The Left, announced that his group had submitted proposed additions to a planned amendment of Poland’s law on water supplies and sewage disposal, which is already intended to further improve drinking-water standards.

Among the newly proposed measures is the introduction of a requirement for restaurants to provide half a litre of tap water for free to every person who orders food.



Other elements include ensuring free access to drinking water in public places, improving the quality of tap water, introducing a rapid warning system if any contamination of water supplies is detected, and helping provide access to running water for those who do not currently have it.

Announcing the measures in parliament, Piotr Kowal, a Left MP, said that it is important to promote drinking tap water because it is more environmentally friendly than consuming water from plastic or glass bottles, reports the Polish Press Agency (PAP).

A number of cities in Poland have in recent years run campaigns encouraging residents to drink tap water, which they note is safe, as well as being cheaper and more environmentally friendly than bottled water.



The Left’s proposals were, however, rejected by infrastructure minister Dariusz Klimczak, who comes from the centre-right Polish People’s Party (PSL), another member of the ruling coalition.

“I don’t think it’s the right time yet, and I won’t support this type of solution,” Klimczak told Radio Zet. “Not all places in Poland have tap water. I wouldn’t want to impose on businesses that you have to give it away for free from now on.”

“We currently have bigger problems on our hands with water: flood control measures, drought control measures, decentralisation of \[state agency\] Polish Waters,” he added. “Once I’ve dealt with that, I’d be happy to discuss free water at restaurants.”



The entire draft amendment to the water law – including The Left’s proposed additions – has now passed to the parliamentary committee on local government and regional policy, which will continue work on the legislation, reports the *Dziennik Gazeta Prawna* daily.

Among other measures included in the bill – which is intended to bring Poland in line with the EU’s Drinking Water Directive – are more stringent quality parameters for drinking water and requirements for water companies to provide customers with clearer data on prices and consumption.

There will also be greater responsibilities for property owners to conduct periodic risk assessments of water supplies and easier online access to up-to-date water quality information for residents.",5,0,0,economy,reddit,https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/09/26/left-calls-for-law-guaranteeing-free-tap-water-in-restaurants-in-poland/,new,Unknown,0.86

This would mean that creating new currency causes the devaluation of all the currency in circulation. This is the argument for why new government debt causes inflation.

I encountered a few historical examples that makes me question this simplistic view on the causes of inflation.

1. Roosevelt and the New Deal 
During the Great Depression Roosevelt created government debt to finance infrastructure projects and thus creating jobs to revive the economy. This did not cause a spike in inflation or higher inflation in the years after.

2. Japan
Japan has a very high debt/gdp ratio and also spent a lot of money sourced from debt. It hasnt seen a spike in inflation. It rather is in a phase of deflation.

3. The GFC in the US
After the collapse of the banking sector and the financial crisis that followed, the government printed money to bail out banks and stimulate the economy. The US hasnt seen a high inflation period in the 2010s.

I am sure there are more examples of government spending not triggering inflation.

A different argument that speaks against the thesis of money printing being responsible for inflation is the data. If the thesis was true, then a spike in debt/gdp or deficit would come (or followed by) an increase of the inflation rate. There should be a high correlation or correlation with lag. I looked at several developed countries and could not see that (I haven't done a statistical analysis of time series yet but I might do this if I find the time). 


So there is a lot of data that does not speak for the theory that has been supported by most economists (for example Milton Friedman).

Let’s get caught up to speed, for the benefit of everyone still obsessing over Epstein and Charlie Kirk:  
  
**Trump** (to planet): “You’re all going to pay huge tariffs on everything. I will change the amounts daily. Bwaaaah!!!”  
  
**China** (to US): “Please cancel our US soybean purchases for 2025. We’ll let you know later about 2026”  
  
**Farmers** (to Trump): “We need a $47 billion bailout because now China is buying all its soybeans from Argentina”  
  
**Trump**: “I’m going to bail out Argentina’s economy. Make Argentina Great Again. And here’s a new tariff on kitchen cabinets, in case anyone was thinking of remodeling.”  
  
The silver lining: at least no talking heads will appear on CNN and PBS wringing their hands over soybean inflation in America’s supermarkets. Stop laughing - all of this is true. See link at bottom.  
  
If you had asked me to guess the value of the annual US soybean crop, I’d have said anywhere from $1 billion to $1 trillion. If you asked me how much of America’s farmland is devoted to soybeans, I’d have been equally helpless. Turns out it’s 85 million acres, equal to the combined land mass of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and Delaware. See second link at bottom.  
  
That is a LOT of farmland devoted just to grow soybeans. What does China do with all of these beans? If you said “tofu” (curdled soy milk, congealed to impersonate cheese) you’d be wrong. China mostly feeds our soybeans to their pigs. Which in turn become pork egg rolls, sweet and sour spareribs, and possibly bacon.  
  
I’m okay with this, if it keeps China from harvesting wild bats and selling them alive in “wet markets”, which THEN ends up infecting half the world with the Covid 19 virus. If that’s the way it actually happened, and the pandemic WASN’T a leak from their Wuhan military experimental virus lab . . .  
  
**Let’s cut to the chase.** I wish no misfortune on America’s farmers. But those 85 million acres are probably put to better use feeding America, rather than fattening pigs to feed a global adversary which is constantly hacking America’s airports and banks, threatening to invade Taiwan, and torturing it’s Nobel peace prize winners in prison.  
  
Can we have a conversation about putting America first (not China or Argentina) and keeping our own people fed and housed?  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

Since the link between illegal money flows and the shadow banking system is still a relatively underexplored field (with limited academic coverage), I’m looking for serious sources to deepen my research. Beyond the well-known cases of Wachovia and HSBC, are there any major investigative reports, long-form journalism pieces, or reliable communities/forums where I can gather insights?

The goal is to build a solid foundation without sounding speculative in front of my professors — so I’m especially interested in credible investigative journalism, financial watchdog reports, or discussions in expert forums rather than conspiracy theories.",3,3,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nrral0/drug_money_and_2008_crisis_thesis/,new,Unknown,1.0

🌽 Maize area ↑ 17% (9.8M hectares, 5-year high)

🌶️ Red chilli exports ↓ 32% this year

Ethanol blending hit 19.8%, with corn now supplying 52% of ethanol


Corn offers higher profits (₹28k/acre vs ₹8k for chillies), shorter crop cycles, and 30–40% less water use. Meanwhile, chilli farmers are hit by collapsing prices, water scarcity, and falling exports.

This shift isn’t just about crops — it’s about policy-driven change reshaping India’s agriculture.

1nrmx72,2025-09-27,2025-09-27 01:17:59,AI leading to jobless growth,"According to imf.org:

The question is whether all this start-up activity is contributing significantly to job growth. Recent research published by the Federal Reserve suggests that the recent wave of start-ups is less likely than previous upsurges to contribute to employment growth. Young, high-growth start-ups accounted for less than 6 percent of employment in 2024, compared with almost 10 percent in 1985, according to the Fed. AI tech–driven start-ups tend to be capital- and skill-intensive, requiring fewer workers.

Productivity and wage increases manifest in the highest-skilled workers; automation reduces the wages of those engaged in routine tasks. Economic dynamism—whereby new businesses boost economic growth—may well reflect not so much large start-ups employing large numbers of workers as an increase in the number of start-ups, each one spawning more such firms thanks to a boost in the region’s risk-taking culture.

According to fool49:

AI will benefit high skilled workers, who can develop, manage, or use AI solutions. As for the deplorables, their numbers and wages will probably remain stagnant. Everyone should have the opportunity to reach their full potential. For the smart or hard working few, it may mean high paying and meaningful work. For the ignorant or lazy majority, it may mean low paying and meaningless work.

Which side are you on?

We graduate knowing mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell — but not how compounding interest makes or breaks your savings. That’s backwards.

History →
Because cycles repeat. Inflation today looks a lot like the 1970s. Debt blowups? Seen them before. If you know the playbook, you’re less likely to be blindsided.

Finance →
Because your wallet is the frontline. Credit cards, loans, compounding, budgeting — this is the difference between building wealth or sinking into debt.

Econ 101 →
Because GDP (Gross Domestic Product), inflation, and trade aren’t abstract. They decide your rent, your wages, your taxes, and whether your job survives the next cycle.

And yes, crypto belongs here too →

Not as a lottery ticket, but as part of the financial landscape you’ll need to understand. If you’re just starting out, a simple plan is DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) into the required holdings: BTC (Bitcoin) and ETH (Ethereum). Beyond that, satellite positions in SOL (Solana), LINK (Chainlink), and newer smart contract plays like Ether.fi are higher-risk, higher-potential bets.

The bigger picture →

You need a diversified financial planner mindset. Not a mutual fund salesman, not a pure-crypto influencer, not a day-trader, and not just another newsletter. The advisor you want in today’s world is one who actually sees the macroeconomic picture — interest rates, energy shocks, currency shifts, inflation cycles — and helps you adjust across stocks, bonds, commodities, crypto, and cash. Too many people blow up their portfolios chasing one lane. The real edge is having guidance that integrates it all, so you’re protected when the cycle turns.

Takeaway

“If you don’t understand the system, you’re stuck playing by someone else’s rules. Econ, Finance, and yes — knowing the basics of crypto — aren’t electives anymore. They’re survival skills.” - The Founder 

Pardon if I’m wasting time for my more experienced readers, but a refresher doesn’t hurt!

China’s international operations centre for the digital yuan opened in Shanghai on Thursday, with the People’s Bank of China highlighting three platforms designed to accelerate the internationalisation of the digital Chinese currency. “The evolution of monetary and payment systems in the digital era is a historical inevitability,” central bank deputy governor Lu Lei told a news conference on Wednesday. “The PBOC is committed to providing open, inclusive and innovative solutions to improve the global cross-border payment system.”

One of the three platforms is a cross-border digital payment platform that will explore the use of the central bank-backed digital currency – also known as e-CNY – to improve the efficiency of international transactions. Another is a blockchain service platform that will enable on-chain payments and provide standardised cross-chain transaction information transfers, and the third is a digital asset platform that will help existing financial infrastructure expand onto the blockchain by providing standardised, ready-to-use digital asset services.

But amid growing tensions with the United States over trade and technology issues, China has stepped up its push to expand overseas adoption of the yuan and e-CNY and accelerate the rise of Shanghai as a global financial hub to reduce its reliance on a US dollar-dominated financial system. In July, US President Donald Trump signed a law that would allow regulated US banks to issue stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to another asset – backed by the US dollar, a move that many observers say could pave the way for mass-market adoption and extend the currency's dominance into the digital realm.

While Beijing is wary of cryptocurrencies and their related risks, it has embraced the use of blockchain technology for its traceability and transparency, and applied it in the adoption of e-CNY. The PBOC has begun to collaborate with central banks in Hong Kong, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on a cross-border platform for digital currency payments. In a notice issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China on September 13, Beijing encouraged more financial institutions to explore the use of the digital yuan for cross-border payments.",0,0,0,economy,reddit,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3326928/will-chinas-digital-yuan-centre-be-step-forward-internationalisation,new,Unknown,0.38

***Photo above*** *- recent conclave of RUSSIAN generals. They apparently have more medals than their Pentagon counterparts, but worse dental coverage. Stay away from those hotel windows, guys . . .*

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned 800 generals admirals to Virginia for an impromptu meeting. I don’t know if 800 is “all of them”, but it’s a lot. I’ve been asking the government to consider closing or merging some of America’s 800 military bases worldwide. Now it appears that we have more than 1 general per base.

I was certain this was the most generals ever, but Google says there were 1,500 during World War 2. Google can’t tell for sure, however, because of promotions, demotions, retirements, and MIA. But that was wartime. Are we officially at war with anyone right now? Other than Washington DC and Los Angeles, mean. Is there a national guard general in DC overseeing the troops collecting trash there?

Each general travelling to Virginia will be accompanied by at least 1 senior advisor and several more aides. The total number of guests could exceed 3,000 . . . easily.

Defense Secretary Hegseth is no stranger to military service himself. He was (for approximately 11 months) a national guard reservist tasked with overseeing the care and feeding of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. So this has GOTTA be the thrill of a lifetime for him to summon and browbeat all the guys who were ever above him in the chain of command. If he has time, Hegseth should also take the wheel of an Abrams tank or Humvee, just for the fun of it.

Rumors are rampant that Hegseth plans to fire (or offer early retirement) to at least 100 generals. But we would still have at least 700 on standby, so I don’t think this materially weakens America’s security. In fact, knowing how the military works, I bet that about 30 seconds after those generals start packing their footlockers, a bunch of colonels start getting promoted to general, and majors get bumped up to colonel, etc. If you don’t think this will happen, you are invited to explain your reasoning.

Another line of speculation is that Hegseth is going to order the generals, admirals, commodores, and whatever to root out all the troops in their command who made disparaging social media posts about Charlie Kirk. Or give everyone a giant pay raise. Or prepare for World War 3. You can’t rule ANYTHING out.

The average General and Admiral earns about $220,000 a year. So if 100 of them do take early retirement, the savings will only be $22 million a year. Chump change. Except that they will all get military retirement pensions (as they should), so the actual savings will be quite a bit smaller.

But the optics of this are going to be great. *“Hey folks, I just fired 100 generals. But don’t worry, we still have at least 3 secret bases in Mogadishu Somalia nobody even knows about, so we’re safer than ever. Ignore the state sponsored hacking which is disabling our airports and commercial flights”.*

  
I'm just sayin' . . .

1nqyhs3,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 07:09:51,Starbucks is closing hundreds of stores and laying off 900 workers what’s going on?,"Starbucks just announced a massive restructuring plan that’s going to shake up how (and where) you get your lattes.

☕ The short version

Hundreds of stores are closing in the U.S. and Canada (and some in Europe).

About 900 corporate/support staff are being laid off.

Starbucks is taking a $1 billion hit in restructuring costs mostly from severance, lease exits, and shutting down underperforming stores.

Same-store sales in the U.S. have fallen for six straight quarters.

Why is Starbucks doing this?

Money talks: A lot of stores just aren’t pulling in enough to cover high rent, labor, and operating costs.

Changing habits: Customers are feeling inflation and cutting back on $6 coffees. Home-brewing setups and local cafés are eating into Starbucks’ dominance.

Strategy shift: CEO Brian Niccol says the company wants to get back to basics. That means fewer but better stores  over 1,000 are getting facelifts ( uplifts ) in the next year.

Reshuffling resources: Closing weaker locations frees up cash to invest in stronger ones.

But here’s the messy part

Workers are caught in the middle. Starbucks says baristas at closing stores can transfer, but critics argue many will end up jobless.

Unions are watching closely. Starbucks has been fighting unionization efforts, and some are accusing the company of using closures to target organized stores (something Starbucks denies).

Reputation risk: Starbucks built its brand on being everywhere. Cutting hundreds of stores risks making it less convenient which could push people to competitors.

Big picture

This isn’t just about coffee. It’s about how big chains handle inflation, high overhead, and changing consumer habits. Starbucks is betting that fewer stores + remodeled locations = higher profits. But with $1B in restructuring costs and rising competition, it’s a risky gamble.

If the turnaround works, Starbucks could reinvent itself. If not, your neighborhood green siren might not be around much longer.

1nqws6z,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 05:26:57,i got a question about energy backed currency,"first i see that a lot of people take energy as a ""stock"" from my research but its not energy comes and goes what you should mesure is how much a country is producing per hour hense the name of energy WH so like 0.01$=1kwh produced.

so from what i see it would link your currency to how much actual product your country is producing instead of speculations and such if you have 100 factories,1000homes and 300buisnesses in a country you can predict the value of a currency since it mirrors the economic stability of a country and

an energy backed currency would actualy make corruption harder since 1kwh=1kwh even in the 4th dimension or inside a black hole its physics you cant just lie and tell someone i got 16 terrawatt/h produced if you lie then the engineers wont have data to regulate the energy production to consumption and the grid will burn

and for the people saying if the grid fails i mean if the grid fails in the modern age you got much much much bigger problems to think about a money wont worth anything if nobody can go work

and it would force the goverment to diversify their energy production to make the currency more stable wich in turn is good for the enviroment

and for inequality between countries i mean we already have that tbh but rn if a currency is already stronger and more stable than other currencies he is the king of the hill and no one can take it from him but if it was an energy backed system small countries will have a chance to compete and have a much more stable currency than other countries

and the value of goods and services will increase with the amount of currency since you need energy to produce any other value

so yeah ik that there are some other problems but we have those same problems here and ik that there has to be smth that makes it not even thought about other than resistence from the elites since this removes TON of power from the elite and gives it to the nature of economics ps(i am by no mean an economist i am just an engineering student lol)",0,0,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1nqws6z/i_got_a_question_about_energy_backed_currency/,new,Unknown,0.5

1nqvv72,2025-09-26,2025-09-26 04:26:41,Like it's year 1670 again,"# When We Say ""Economy,"" Do We Mean ""Gentry""?

# How Neutral Language Masks Concentrated Power

When politicians promise to ""help the economy"" or economists discuss ""market forces,"" the language sounds universal and democratic. But beneath these neutral terms lies a more uncomfortable reality: what we call ""the economy"" is largely controlled by a small class of owners who bear striking resemblance to the historical gentry.

# The Numbers

The concentration of economic power in modern America is staggering. As of 2023, the top 1% of American households owned 30 cents of every dollar, while in the first quarter of 2024, almost two-thirds percent of the total wealth in the United States was owned by the top 10 percent of earners. Meanwhile, the lowest 50 percent of earners only owned 2.5 percent of the total wealth.

But when we look specifically at productive capital ownership of businesses, stocks, and income-generating real estate, the concentration becomes even more extreme. The richest 1 percent own 50 percent of U.S. stock and mutual funds, up from 40 percent in 2002, according to Federal Reserve data. In fact, a record 93% of stock wealth is owned by the richest 10%, the Federal Reserve has found.

This isn't just about having money. It's about owning the systems that generate wealth: the factories, the algorithms, the distribution networks, the platforms where others work. A relatively small number of people own the means by which everyone else makes a living.

# The New Gentry Class

This ownership class functions remarkably like the historical gentry. Both derive their power and income primarily from ownership rather than labor. Both often inherit their advantages across generations. Both wield disproportionate political influence that flows directly from their economic position.

The key difference is that today's gentry own shares and intellectual property as well as landed estates. But the fundamental dynamic remains: a small class lives off the returns from assets while the majority work for wages within systems they don't control.

# The Language 

Here's where the euphemism becomes clear. When we hear ""economic growth,"" ""job creators,"" or ""market efficiency,"" these phrases obscure who actually makes the decisions and who benefits most from the outcomes.

""The economy"" sounds like a natural force or a collective endeavor. But in practice, major economic decisions such as where to invest, what to produce, how to organize work, and which communities get resources are made by and for the ownership class.

Consider how different our political discourse would sound if we used more precise language:

* ""Helping the economy"" becomes ""increasing returns to capital owners""
* ""Market forces"" becomes ""decisions by large asset holders""
* ""Economic policy"" becomes ""rules that govern how the ownership class can extract value""

# Beyond the Euphemism

Recognizing this linguistic sleight of hand doesn't require embracing any particular political solution. But it does demand intellectual honesty about how power actually works in our economic system.

When we strip away the neutral terminology, we see that many ""economic"" debates are really debates about class power: Should ownership be more distributed? Should workers have more say in workplace decisions? Should inheritance laws allow wealth concentration across generations?

These are fundamentally political questions about how we want to organize society, not technical questions about optimal resource allocation. The gentry, by whatever name we call them, understand this. Perhaps it's time the rest of us did too.

# The Power of Precise Language

Language shapes how we think about problems and solutions. As long as we discuss ""the economy"" as if it were a weather system rather than a set of human institutions controlled by specific people with specific interests, we'll struggle to have honest conversations about economic power.

The next time someone promises to ""help the economy,"" it's worth asking: whose economy? And who really controls it?

Also USA should not be allowed to engage in economic warfare against its enemies. Iran and Venezuela are sovereign nations. If they are guilty of human rights abuses, so are USA and India.

1nqied0,2025-09-25,2025-09-25 16:56:19,U.S. Economy Expands Fastest in the G7 — But Not Everyone Feels It,"Per the latest BEA revision reported by The Times (Mehreen Khan, 25 Sep 2025), the U.S. economy grew at an annualized 3.8% in Q2 — the fastest pace in nearly two years and the best among the G7. Consumer spending and private investment were revised higher, and initial jobless claims surprised to the downside. Whatever your politics, that’s real, measurable momentum.

But anyone who works with small producers, family businesses, or outside the big metros also knows: headline growth isn’t evenly experienced. Averages can conceal the fact that some groups are still under pressure (rising input costs, tighter financing, competition with scale players, and household balance-sheet strain).

The lesson from past “cuts-without-growth” experiments (Kansas is the usual case study) isn’t that reform is impossible. It’s that growth engines and governance have to move together. Cutting or subsidizing in a vacuum just shifts the pain around. The way you broaden participation is by pairing macro strength with practical pathways for people to adapt.

What that looks like in the real world:
	•	Business-model change for small players. Instead of endless, blunt subsidies, help farms and small firms modernize: technical assistance, market access, logistics co-ops, and low-interest public loans that crowd in private capital. That’s how you turn resilience into competitiveness.
	•	Smarter trade conditions. Whether via negotiated reciprocity or targeted tariffs, reduce arbitrage that punishes domestic producers while keeping export lanes open. The goal is better terms, not autarky.
	•	Balance-sheet prudence. In a volatile global system, owning hard, liquid hedges (households, institutions, and many central banks outside the U.S. have been net buyers of gold in recent years) can stabilize portfolios. For clarity: the U.S. official gold stock is largely unchanged; the point is risk management at the private/institutional level.
	•	Grow out of deficits. Sustained growth is the most durable way to lower debt-to-GDP. Austerity alone shrinks the tax base; growth plus reform expands it.

The U.S. posting 3.8% while leading the G7 is the good news. The next step is making sure more people can actually plug into that momentum. That’s less about abstract ideology and more about execution: practical finance, market access, and incentives that reward adaptation.

I’ll add a comment with a simple line chart showing the divergence (headline GDP improving vs. stress indicators for small business, farm income, and household debt) — not to dunk on the data, but to keep the discussion honest about who still needs a bridge into the boom.

***Photo above*** *- Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter. Notice the axe - it is NOT one of the 5 proven ways to kill a vampire for sure.*  
  
I have nothing against AI. It’s doing middle school kids' homework in a flash, giving them more time to play Call of Duty: Black Ops. In fact, AI is now designing videogames. The circle is unbroken!  
  
If you don’t play videogames, no need tot fret. AI is also doing the CGI on new TV series like “Star Trek – Strange New Worlds”. And possibly writing the screenplays as well. Which explains why ST-SNW episodes are rehashes of previous Star Trek series. AI just regurgitates what was trained on.  
  
The link below warns that AI is already using as much electricity as New York City and San Diego combined. I don’t really care about New York but I’d like to save San Diego if there’s still time. Maybe there isn’t. The article (Fortune magazine) goes on to theorize that AI will soon account for 10% of all the electricity used in the USA.  
  
If 10% doesn't seem like a lot, imagine the frenzy if someone warned that almond groves in California were using 10% of the state's water supply, or that 10% of the Brazilian rainforest was being clear-cut each year to create cattle pasture. (Both of these are true, apparently).  
  
In a related article (no link today, Google it) tech-boys are celebrating the imminent arrival of “backyard nuclear plants”. Not literally in YOUR back yard, if you own a 2,200 colonial on a quarter acre lot. Probably located in that vacanat lot which was going to become a mini-park with pickleball courts. (Village mayor: *“This should be a no-brainer. Do you want the lights to stay on, or do you want boomers playing pickleball day and night?”*)  
  
Just one problem: the typical US town doesn’t have the expertise to operate a nuclear power plant, even one the size of a shipping container. So they will hire some contractor to run it, like we do with private/for-profit prisons. And when it comes to plant maintenance and the safe storage of nuclear waste, those will be put on hold because the municipal employees’ pension fund is underfunded by a million dollars, and that has to be fixed before the next election, or those workers won’t vote to re-elect incumbent mayor and city council. (*""They saved our pensions!*)  
  
If you think the “deferred nuclear maintenance” thing won’t happen, just look at your own city’s water supply or mass transit. If you live in California, look overhead at the 100-year-old high voltage lines which keep sparking wildfires.  
  
As I noted at the start of today's column , I don’t hate AI. But kids won’t be any worse off if they have to cut and paste a Wikipedia article for their homework, instead of having ChatGPT tell them that Lincoln owned a fence installation business before he became president, freed the slaves, and hunted vampires.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

Barclays analysed 250 operational mines linked to 30 mining clients and around 9,000 power generation facilities from 40 European clients, and found both sectors faced notable earnings declines over five years.
The mining sector was hit harder, with earnings falling by around a quarter, driven largely by transition risks. Power companies saw a smaller impact of about 10%, mainly due to physical risks such as droughts and floods, which are more severe in degraded landscapes.

According to fool49:

Environmental degradation is going to have an impact on the bottom line. Europe must give up its addiction to raw materials and consumption. Transition to a sustainable or circular economy. Slow down or stop destruction of ecosystems and related services and biodiversity. EU talks a big game about protecting the environment. But what is the ground reality?

EU companies need to look after the triple bottom line: people, profit, and planet. EU policy needs to transition to maximizing GDP plus natural capital plus human capital. And tax those companies contributing to destruction of natural or human capital. While also rewarding companies with positive externalities.

Quantitative tightening mostly emptied ON RRP during the 2022-2024 period, as money funds migrated into bills, cushioning risk markets from reserve scarcity. But that cushion is gone! ON RRP usage has dwindled to near zero by late August 2025, so further balance‑sheet runoff now bites directly into bank reserves, the same regime that ended painfully in 2019.

The Fed already slowed QT twice — first in June 2024 and again in April 2025 — precisely to approach the unknown ample‑reserves regime more carefully. With TGA elevated and tax/quarter‑end ahead, marginal dollars will toggle between Treasury’s account and reserves with little buffer.

The implication is a market that becomes very sensitive to the cadence of bill issuance, tax dates and SRF take‑up: when TGA swells or issuance clusters, net liquidity sags and reserve balances tighten; when TGA drains, the relief rallies are sharp.

1npvhry,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 22:43:05,The Lesson of the Efficient Market Hypothesis: “Stock Prices Are Unpredictable”,"The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), first formalized by Eugene Fama in 1970, carries a sobering message for investors: if all publicly available information is already reflected in stock prices, then predicting tomorrow’s price is essentially impossible.

Why “Good News” Doesn’t Guarantee Gains

Markets tend to price in expectations before the news hits the wire. If investors anticipate that a company will post blockbuster earnings tomorrow, the stock price usually rises today—well before the actual announcement. Once the earnings are released, the price adjusts only to whatever new information emerges. That’s why trying to guess where a stock will go next is a fool’s errand. This logic underpins the random walk hypothesis, which argues that stock prices move unpredictably.

Does That Make Stock Analysis Useless?

Not necessarily. EMH suggests that on average, it’s extremely difficult to beat the market, which is why index funds have become the go-to investment vehicle for many. But markets are not perfectly efficient. Behavioral economists, like Nobel laureate Robert Shiller, have shown that fear, greed, and herd behavior create bubbles and crashes that EMH alone cannot explain.

The Buffett Exception

The existence of investors like Warren Buffett raises an uncomfortable question: if markets are truly efficient, how can anyone consistently outperform? Dismissing decades of outperformance as “luck” feels unsatisfying. Buffett himself has admitted, however, that most investors should simply buy low-cost index funds rather than chasing alpha. His success reflects both extraordinary discipline and the fact that markets, while mostly efficient, have pockets of inefficiency.

Where EMH Still Guides Us

Even if the hypothesis is not absolute, its implications matter:

1. Beware of hot tips. If a piece of information is truly valuable, chances are it’s already in the price.

2. Don’t overestimate your edge. For every investor who beats the market, someone else must lag behind—sometimes badly.

3. Stay humble. The stock market thrives on uncertainty, and those who forget that risk becoming the “greater fool.”

In the end, EMH doesn’t mean markets are perfectly rational, but it does remind us that chasing short-term predictions is a losing game. For most people, the smarter path is clear: own the market, stay invested, and avoid the temptation of easy promises.",3,0,0,economy,reddit,https://i.redd.it/r0rcb7gs48rf1.jpeg,new,Unknown,1.0

1npg998,2025-09-24,2025-09-24 12:07:37,Will money collapse forever?,"It comes to a meaning of what is money. Money is a resource of exchange for goods and services. For thousands of years, from the days of Mesopotamia when clay tablets recorded debts of grain and silver, money has acted as both a symbol of trust and a mechanism of coordination. People accepted it not because the coins or notes themselves had value, but because everyone agreed they could be used to obtain something else of value or can be easily tangible.

Fast forward to today, money is mostly digital signals blinking across banking servers, algorithmically traded faster than any human can blink. Yet even in this form, the same principle holds: money is is just data. And today's value has been depended on human scarcity. On the idea that our labor, our time, our knowledge, are limited and must be exchanged.

Here is where the story bends: artificial intelligence is beginning to unravel this foundation. If AI agents can design, produce, negotiate, and distribute with **near-zero** marginal cost, then the scarcity of human effort once the very anchor of money’s meaning is dissolved. Why would anyone pay for something when an AI can produce it endlessly and flawlessly? What would happen if these are powered fully by **renewable energy**? If machines outperform humans in nearly every market, the logic of exchange itself falters.

This does not necessarily mean collapse in the apocalyptic sense, but a metamorphosis. The end of money as we know it may give rise to a new system of ownership: perhaps measured not in dollars or crypto-tokens, but in access, reputation, or even attention. In such a future, the “resource of exchange” might no longer be material at all, but social, cognitive, or experiential.

The paradox is that money has always been both fiction and reality. A fiction because it only works if we believe in it, a reality because that belief has shaped empires, economies, and daily life. The arrival of AI may push us toward a future where we need to invent a new fiction, and probably form a new civilization into another planet. One fit for a world where human labor is not the bottleneck.

The real question isn’t whether money collapses forever, but what replaces it when humans are no longer the engines of value creation? Let's discuss this",0,4,0,economy,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1npg998/will_money_collapse_forever/,new,Unknown,0.17
